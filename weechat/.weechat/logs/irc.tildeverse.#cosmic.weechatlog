2018-11-21 05:09:34	~tomasino	log nearly does something
2018-11-21 05:11:45	ahriman	lol, nearly does something
2018-11-21 05:20:04	+ben	"nearly does something" is a very accurate statement for a lot of the code i write lol
2018-11-21 05:21:12	hyperboredoubt	Good night everyone.
2018-11-21 05:21:48	ahriman	g'night hyperboredoubt

2018-11-21 05:22:23	<--	hyperboredoubt (hyperboredo@yourtilde.com) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
2018-11-21 05:47:36	~tomasino	okay, got a basic thing working, ben
2018-11-21 05:47:45	+ben	oooh nice
2018-11-21 05:47:59	~tomasino	the workflow is like this: author a txt file in your ship directory. name it however you want.
2018-11-21 05:48:04	~tomasino	when you're done and ready to publish, run log
2018-11-21 05:48:20	~tomasino	it will prompt you for each unpublished file in each ship you own if you want to send the message
2018-11-21 05:48:24	~tomasino	if so, it asks for a title
2018-11-21 05:48:27	+ben	apt list --upgradable | wc 
2018-11-21 05:48:28	~tomasino	bam, gopher updated
2018-11-21 05:48:29	+ben	44
2018-11-21 05:48:44	~tomasino	upgrading
2018-11-21 05:48:58	+ben	where do published files end up?
2018-11-21 05:49:16	+ben	will they be editable after publishing?
2018-11-21 05:49:19	~tomasino	you're authoring directly in the gopher dir
2018-11-21 05:49:28	~tomasino	you maintain full access to your messages
2018-11-21 05:49:43	+ben	so what is publishing then?
2018-11-21 05:49:49	+ben	if you're already working live
2018-11-21 05:49:50	~tomasino	and technically, everyone has write access to the root gophermap too, but touching it only via the "log" will help keep it clean
2018-11-21 05:49:58	~tomasino	publishing is linking in the gophermap
2018-11-21 05:49:59	~tomasino	that's it!
2018-11-21 05:50:02	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-21 05:50:23	~tomasino	super fancy, right?
2018-11-21 05:50:25	+ben	lol
2018-11-21 05:50:26	~tomasino	haha
2018-11-21 05:50:27	+ben	ok 
2018-11-21 05:51:10	~tomasino	i would have liked to have preserved the access to the gophermap to avoid possible issues, but i couldn't think of a smart way tonight
2018-11-21 05:51:26	~tomasino	and i'd like to make something to manage ships and messages later too
2018-11-21 05:51:29	+ben	i think it's better to not give full access to that
2018-11-21 05:51:30	~tomasino	but this "works"
2018-11-21 05:51:36	+ben	so the format is just txt?
2018-11-21 05:51:41	~tomasino	yep
2018-11-21 05:51:49	~tomasino	do as thou wilt
2018-11-21 05:51:58	~tomasino	the only gophermap is the relay
2018-11-21 05:52:26	+ben	so the posts could be gophermaps themselves?
2018-11-21 05:52:38	+ben	ok i'll need to grab my vim setup
2018-11-21 05:52:40	~tomasino	technically, yes, but the log script is assuming they're type 0
2018-11-21 05:52:54	~tomasino	but that's going to get far more robust
2018-11-21 05:53:14	~tomasino	and the root gophermap will likely become a menu itself with options to view the logs of all ships or visit each one
2018-11-21 05:53:20	~tomasino	and then you'll get gophermaps of each
2018-11-21 05:53:22	~tomasino	and yadda yadda
2018-11-21 05:53:28	~tomasino	MVP tonight
2018-11-21 05:53:39	~tomasino	you can publish
2018-11-21 05:53:41	+ben	ok nice
2018-11-21 05:53:52	+ben	i'm going to write something up before i turn in for the night
2018-11-21 05:54:03	~tomasino	excellent
2018-11-21 05:54:07	~tomasino	hopefully it won't blow up everything
2018-11-21 05:54:10	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-21 05:54:33	~tomasino	i'm not doing a very "clean" job of the gophermap rewriting. it'll need more error handling
2018-11-21 05:54:43	~tomasino	https://tildegit.org/tomasino/cosmic/src/branch/master/log
2018-11-21 05:54:46	+ben	you're going to want to have a canonical source
2018-11-21 05:54:55	+ben	so that you can regenerate the gophermap from source
2018-11-21 05:55:04	+ben	i think
2018-11-21 05:55:15	+ben	should be idempotent
2018-11-21 05:55:19	~tomasino	it should
2018-11-21 05:55:26	~tomasino	but not tonight
2018-11-21 05:55:44	+ben	ok
2018-11-21 05:55:46	+ben	:P
2018-11-21 05:57:58	~tomasino	hah, got it
2018-11-21 05:58:02	~tomasino	so yeah... tonignht
2018-11-21 05:58:07	~tomasino	using some gophernicus tricks
2018-11-21 05:58:21	+ben	prison editoin 
2018-11-21 05:58:25	+ben	s/oi/io
2018-11-21 05:58:25	sedbot	<ben> prison edition 
2018-11-21 05:58:56	~tomasino	gophernicus can import gophermaps from other gophermaps
2018-11-21 05:59:01	~tomasino	so the intro text is externalized
2018-11-21 05:59:08	~tomasino	only the listings themselves are in there now
2018-11-21 05:59:25	~tomasino	oooh, that makes this even better!!!! 
2018-11-21 05:59:29	~tomasino	standby...
2018-11-21 06:00:24	+ben	heh nice
2018-11-21 06:00:31	+ben	so it's already rebuildable
2018-11-21 06:02:32	~tomasino	mostly
2018-11-21 06:02:39	~tomasino	and i'm getting rid of some precarious sed stuff
2018-11-21 06:05:28	+ben	heh yeah
2018-11-21 06:05:34	+ben	gotta be careful with that bad boi
2018-11-21 06:05:50	~tomasino	haha, oh yeah, baby
2018-11-21 06:05:52	~tomasino	isolations
2018-11-21 06:06:08	+ben	i'm trying to decide how much influence i want to draw from your initial melchizidek transmission
2018-11-21 06:06:35	~tomasino	except crap... permission denied
2018-11-21 06:06:39	~tomasino	why, though
2018-11-21 06:06:49	+ben	:o
2018-11-21 06:07:54	~tomasino	it's group writable
2018-11-21 06:07:57	~tomasino	stupid internet connection
2018-11-21 06:08:09	fosslinux	why is that stupid internet connection
2018-11-21 06:08:56	~tomasino	this one here keeps hiccuping
2018-11-21 06:09:04	~tomasino	it's very distracting
2018-11-21 06:09:06	fosslinux	that is mine all the time
2018-11-21 06:09:09	+ben	which file are you having trouble with?
2018-11-21 06:09:09	fosslinux	use mosh
2018-11-21 06:09:43	+ben	looks like the main gophermaps are only writable as root
2018-11-21 06:11:21	~tomasino	yeah, i changed that
2018-11-21 06:11:46	~tomasino	listing.gophermap was group writable by the users group... but i need to generate a temp file and replace it in order to prepend content
2018-11-21 06:11:53	~tomasino	so... that means moving another file on top of it
2018-11-21 06:11:58	~tomasino	which wants to rewrite permissions
2018-11-21 06:12:01	+ben	rips
2018-11-21 06:12:01	~tomasino	and that's blowing up
2018-11-21 06:12:11	~tomasino	so i'm making the stupid listing 777 and seeing what's what
2018-11-21 06:15:16	~tomasino	got it
2018-11-21 06:15:23	~tomasino	had to cat into it instead of mv
2018-11-21 06:16:04	~tomasino	okay, you should be able to do good happy things with it now
2018-11-21 06:16:15	+ben	oh i think we ran into that while troubleshooting burrow
2018-11-21 06:16:23	+ben	maybe it wasn't the same thing
2018-11-21 06:16:28	~tomasino	i forget
2018-11-21 06:16:31	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-21 06:16:32	+ben	that was mktemp not respecting umask
2018-11-21 06:16:37	~tomasino	oh yes, similar thing
2018-11-21 06:16:55	~tomasino	https://tildegit.org/tomasino/cosmic/src/branch/master/log#L43
2018-11-21 06:16:58	~tomasino	that's the magic line
2018-11-21 06:17:23	fosslinux	tomasino: do you have any good tutorials on how gopher works? i'm struggling to understand gophermaps etc...
2018-11-21 06:17:38	+ben	https://gopher.zone is a good place to start
2018-11-21 06:17:44	+ben	oh also 
2018-11-21 06:17:50	~tomasino	ben beat me to it
2018-11-21 06:18:00	+ben	see https://github.com/kimholviala/gophernicus/blob/master/README.Gophermap
2018-11-21 06:18:00	~tomasino	i made gopher.zone as a way to answer that question, foss
2018-11-21 06:18:11	+ben	i like this gophermap readme
2018-11-21 06:18:20	+ben	;)
2018-11-21 06:18:30	fosslinux	nice tomasino
2018-11-21 06:18:36	~tomasino	it's pretty solid, though it shows a lot of the fancy gophernicus specific things
2018-11-21 06:18:39	~tomasino	but yeah, it's nice
2018-11-21 06:18:47	fosslinux	do we run gophernicus on ~team ben?
2018-11-21 06:18:50	+ben	1 and 0 are the most important types
2018-11-21 06:18:52	+ben	yes fosslinux 
2018-11-21 06:19:03	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-21 06:19:04	+ben	https://gopher.tildeverse.org/tilde.team
2018-11-21 06:19:09	+ben	should show in the footer there
2018-11-21 06:19:24	+ben	gopher://tilde.team i suppose
2018-11-21 06:19:35	~tomasino	ben, i'll be creating a second stream of chatter on here soon. I'm going to add a hippy commune settlement ship to the mix and their message style is going to be drastically different
2018-11-21 06:19:47	+ben	oooh nice
2018-11-21 06:19:54	+ben	i have no idea what my ship is going to be yet
2018-11-21 06:20:12	+ben	i'd really like to see some way to be notified of new activity
2018-11-21 06:20:22	+ben	i get very forgetful to check it otherwise
2018-11-21 06:20:25	~tomasino	Melch is going to be a sci-fi mystery thing
2018-11-21 06:20:44	~tomasino	i could generate a rss feed of this once we get going
2018-11-21 06:21:36	+ben	i think i'll play off the actual demosthenes and also the demosthenes pseudonym adopted by valentine in ender's game
2018-11-21 06:21:48	+ben	QEC will be called ansibel
2018-11-21 06:22:08	+ben	actually
2018-11-21 06:22:15	+ben	could you rename my ship to adrestia tomasino ?
2018-11-21 06:22:29	~tomasino	one moment
2018-11-21 06:22:33	+ben	or is that somehting i can do
2018-11-21 06:22:56	~tomasino	done
2018-11-21 06:23:05	~tomasino	i think you could have done it
2018-11-21 06:23:09	~tomasino	since you own the dir
2018-11-21 06:23:16	+ben	heh ok :P
2018-11-21 06:23:21	fosslinux	i gophermap go make
2018-11-21 06:23:27	fosslinux	not actually hard
2018-11-21 06:23:39	~tomasino	but if you had written messages first, we'd also have had to update the listings
2018-11-21 06:23:57	~tomasino	i check that the listings begin with a match of your ship name
2018-11-21 06:24:40	+ben	ok :)
2018-11-21 06:24:42	+ben	thanks though
2018-11-21 06:25:26	~tomasino	you think i should auto-cap the first letter of the ship name?
2018-11-21 06:25:41	~tomasino	in the gophermap?
2018-11-21 06:25:52	~tomasino	i kept the directories lowercased
2018-11-21 06:26:00	+ben	i was thinking of keeping it lowercase
2018-11-21 06:26:11	+ben	but it's not a big deal either way
2018-11-21 06:26:42	~tomasino	i think i'm gonna cap mine. while there's just 2 of us it's fine ,but i think someone will want caps at some point and then the lowercase will look funny
2018-11-21 06:27:03	+ben	feel free to though
2018-11-21 06:27:04	+ben	i don't mind
2018-11-21 06:27:16	+ben	i'm going to keep it lowercase to start with at least
2018-11-21 06:27:27	~tomasino	oh, that blows stuff up, eh?
2018-11-21 06:27:29	fosslinux	whats with the following text on the gophermap
2018-11-21 06:27:30	~tomasino	i better figure out why
2018-11-21 06:27:34	fosslinux	âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ: *âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ:* âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ: *âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ:* âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ: *âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ:* âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ: *âœ§ï½¥ï¾Ÿ:*
2018-11-21 06:27:45	~tomasino	just pretty starfield graphics in utf-8
2018-11-21 06:27:54	fosslinux	ok sure

2018-11-21 06:29:13	~tomasino	derp
2018-11-21 06:29:15	~tomasino	one sec
2018-11-21 06:29:35	~tomasino	there we go
2018-11-21 06:29:39	~tomasino	had to cap the path too
2018-11-21 06:29:42	~tomasino	now i'm all good
2018-11-21 06:33:48	~tomasino	in the next couple days i'll work on making log more powerful, creating new messages for your ships using custom templates
2018-11-21 06:33:54	~tomasino	and RSS
2018-11-21 06:34:17	+ben	templates will be dope
2018-11-21 06:35:20	dokuja1	Yay read the first entry
2018-11-21 06:35:47	~tomasino	:D
2018-11-21 06:50:48	+ben	posted a first update

2018-11-22 02:38:56	~tomasino	hiya hyperboredoubt

2018-11-22 02:42:51	~tomasino	the ... is part of it?
2018-11-22 02:42:51	+ben	there's a makefile in the repo too if that doesn't work
2018-11-22 02:42:53	+ben	yes
2018-11-22 02:43:00	+ben	not sure why but it is
2018-11-22 02:43:01	~tomasino	weird
2018-11-22 02:43:16	+ben	who'd've thunk
2018-11-22 02:43:21	+ben	it's very cold here
2018-11-22 02:43:33	+ben	I'm walking to the bar in my hometown
2018-11-22 02:43:40	~tomasino	fatal: repository 'https://tildegit.org/team/gopherproxy.git/' not found
2018-11-22 02:43:50	~tomasino	weird
2018-11-22 02:44:01	+ben	might have moved it to the tildeverse org
2018-11-22 02:44:01	~tomasino	i'll clone and run make i guess

2018-11-22 02:52:09	~tomasino	cosmic.voyage will have to wait a bit for a web proxy
2018-11-22 02:59:45	~tomasino	well, we've got nginx running and certbot enabled for https when i get around to installing gopherproxy
2018-11-22 02:59:48	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-22 05:07:23	~tomasino	my ship creator script is done. huzzah. Adding ships/colonies/outposts/whatever will be very easy now, just like adding users.
2018-11-22 05:07:31	~tomasino	next up, making it easier to author stuff

2018-11-25 05:24:16	~tomasino	hrm, not yet!
2018-11-25 05:24:32	~tomasino	you could have it as a second log entry, i suppose
2018-11-25 05:24:51	~tomasino	they are added to the log in the order that you say "yes" during the log command
2018-11-25 05:25:16	khuxkm	for now I guess I'll put it on tilde.team :P
2018-11-25 05:25:41	~tomasino	:( that's sad. it won't be aggregated so nicely in all the forms
2018-11-25 05:25:48	khuxkm	so ~/ships/Excelsior is the main copy, right? (as in, that goes straight to gopher)
2018-11-25 05:26:00	khuxkm	well, it's either that or attaching it at the end

2018-11-25 17:09:22	~tomasino	if you want, you could add it there and PR, or I can symlink your local and let you play over time
2018-11-25 17:10:56	~tomasino	if you create a file starting with a dot in your ship dir, 'log' will ignore it

2018-11-25 17:11:28	~tomasino	might be useful for drafts or templates too
2018-11-25 17:11:42	khuxkm|lounge	oh, I'll definitely put it in the cosmic scripts repo
2018-11-25 17:11:45	khuxkm|lounge	when it's finished
2018-11-25 17:12:07	khuxkm|lounge	(btw I can help you assemble the tildegit organization and set up webhooks :P)
2018-11-25 17:12:40	~tomasino	i think tildegit is ben's

2018-11-25 20:23:45	~tomasino	i think i need to detect long lines and autowrap the html output, though
2018-11-25 20:24:12	~tomasino	gopher does it okay, but html is set to pre for the ascii art
2018-11-25 21:31:10	ahriman	ugh zsh is so much nicer than ksh
2018-11-25 21:31:51	ahriman	ive used the crap out of ksh because of openbsd and it grates on me
2018-11-25 22:18:31	khuxkm|lounge	I'm working on making the lines limit to 80
2018-11-25 22:22:07	khuxkm|lounge	tomasino: how does the HTML regen?

2018-11-26 21:19:20	~tomasino	i'm going to explore a richer interface for the main gophermap soon using some cgi scripts
2018-11-26 21:19:28	~tomasino	i'll also explore adding tls support
2018-11-26 21:23:00	ben	to gopher??
2018-11-26 21:23:06	~tomasino	yep
2018-11-26 21:23:20	~tomasino	stunnel4
2018-11-26 21:23:27	~tomasino	gophernicus has built in support
2018-11-26 21:23:41	~tomasino	just gotta piggy-back on my lets encrypt certs
2018-11-26 21:25:00	~tomasino	first i'm going to generate individual ship log pages and a link to the ship lists
2018-11-26 21:25:24	~tomasino	and then separate out the full log page from the most recent 10 or so that'll be on the main index
2018-11-26 21:25:34	ben	woah nice
2018-11-26 21:25:36	 *	dokuja has TLS working too.
2018-11-26 21:25:36	~tomasino	and also duplicate that for web
2018-11-26 21:25:43	ben	ship lists would be great
2018-11-26 21:25:54	ben	i oughtta get tls working on ~team!
2018-11-26 21:25:56	dokuja	Its not bad to set up. 
2018-11-26 21:26:10	~tomasino	there's a sample setup at the bottom of the gophernicus readme
2018-11-26 21:26:26	~tomasino	but it's a lower priority than ship pages & logs, i think
2018-11-26 21:26:35	dokuja	That's fair. 
2018-11-26 21:27:11	~tomasino	do you all think there's value in some meta-data for these things? like a ".description" file in your ship dir to be prepended to your ship page?
2018-11-26 21:27:24	~tomasino	if it exists it can serve as an intro if you want it
2018-11-26 21:27:33	~tomasino	or something?
2018-11-26 21:28:09	~tomasino	i want to keep things simple, which is one of the reasons I'm having people just write text files and log them rather than forcing everyone to learn how to use gophermaps well
2018-11-26 21:29:44	ben	just a plaintext file that gets included
2018-11-26 21:29:50	ben	i like it

2018-11-27 03:05:20	~tomasino	well, i guess that leaves either writing content or TLS as next steps
2018-11-27 03:05:28	~tomasino	unless anyone has another request
2018-11-27 03:09:25	ben	maybe make the font on the site a big bigger? ;)

2018-11-27 04:28:10	 *	tomasino doesn't use vf1 much
2018-11-27 04:28:41	dokuja	hrm, I get OS error, that's a first
2018-11-27 04:28:53	~tomasino	yeah
2018-11-27 04:29:25	dokuja	basugasu.bakuhatsu.org:7070
2018-11-27 04:29:35	dokuja	if you need to check syntax
2018-11-27 04:29:45	~tomasino	that worked
2018-11-27 04:29:51	~tomasino	so yeah, i'm still borked
2018-11-27 04:29:56	dokuja	ok, hrm, what's the cert look like?
2018-11-27 04:29:58	~tomasino	stunnel says it's running
2018-11-27 04:30:13	~tomasino	i did this:
2018-11-27 04:30:14	ben	what letsencrypt client do u use
2018-11-27 04:30:18	~tomasino	certbot
2018-11-27 04:30:22	ben	ah ok same
2018-11-27 04:30:40	~tomasino	/etc/letsencrypt/live/cosmic.voyage/cert.pem
2018-11-27 04:30:44	~tomasino	i also included...
2018-11-27 04:30:48	ben	no
2018-11-27 04:30:51	~tomasino	key = /etc/letsencrypt/live/cosmic.voyage/privkey.pem
2018-11-27 04:30:53	ben	you want fullchain.pem
2018-11-27 04:30:56	~tomasino	ahh
2018-11-27 04:30:59	~tomasino	that could be the problem
2018-11-27 04:31:03	ben	you generally don't want to use cert.pem
2018-11-27 04:31:20	dokuja	oh yeah fullchain, good catch
2018-11-27 04:31:27	~tomasino	okay, lets try now...
2018-11-27 04:31:35	dokuja	yay!
2018-11-27 04:31:37	~tomasino	YISS!
2018-11-27 04:31:41	 *	tomasino does a jig
2018-11-27 04:31:44	ben	heh
2018-11-27 04:31:50	ben	what is cert.pem for then
2018-11-27 04:31:53	~tomasino	i had to chmod them to 600
2018-11-27 04:32:00	dokuja	just the cert, doesn't have the ca chain
2018-11-27 04:32:01	~tomasino	which may break EVERYTHING
2018-11-27 04:32:02	~tomasino	i have no idea
2018-11-27 04:32:14	dokuja	some servers have a separate chain directive
2018-11-27 04:32:21	dokuja	it's bonkers
2018-11-27 04:32:27	~tomasino	stunnel wouldn't start with the normal certbot permission of 644
2018-11-27 04:32:54	ben	https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#where-are-my-certificates
2018-11-27 04:33:03	~tomasino	i forgot i'm piping everything in vf1 through lolcat
2018-11-27 04:33:07	~tomasino	it's so pretty
2018-11-27 04:33:13	ben	echo everything | lolcat
2018-11-27 04:34:06	~tomasino	i guess i should probably add a tor node next
2018-11-27 04:34:08	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-27 04:34:17	~tomasino	for ... reasons
2018-11-27 04:34:23	ben	/reasons/
2018-11-27 04:34:41	~tomasino	maybe i'll take a break from housekeeping and do some writing instead
2018-11-27 04:35:28	dokuja	yes!
2018-11-27 04:35:56	~tomasino	hah
2018-11-27 04:36:07	~tomasino	i think solderpunk is going to be joining soon
2018-11-27 04:38:19	~tomasino	hrm... something wonky with log, now
2018-11-27 04:38:24	~tomasino	might be related to my new stuff
2018-11-27 04:41:22	~tomasino	better, missing a sort
2018-11-27 04:41:25	dokuja	I need to come up with something.  It looks fun
2018-11-27 04:41:35	~tomasino	just start writing
2018-11-27 04:41:41	~tomasino	haha
2018-11-27 04:41:56	dokuja	yeah, haha
2018-11-27 04:42:09	~tomasino	i was thinking that eventually someone could make a boring old blog, but just pretend everything in their life is happening on another outpost
2018-11-27 04:42:22	~tomasino	literally the same stuff they'd normally write, changed setting
2018-11-27 04:42:56	dokuja	like work = moonbase alpha
2018-11-27 04:43:03	~tomasino	yep
2018-11-27 04:44:08	~tomasino	"The douchbags kept calling helpdesk all day, again. The tedium is endless. I stare out the window at the vast plains of nothingness across this barren landscape and find more joy and excitement than in the office. Proxima Centuri blows."
2018-11-27 04:44:27	dokuja	ahhaha
2018-11-27 04:45:09	~tomasino	time for a snack
2018-11-27 04:45:11	~tomasino	back in a bit
2018-11-27 04:47:00	dokuja	ok

2018-11-29 03:37:25	jabooty	I'm still trying to get my bearings again in a universe like this. Years and years ago I took part in an IRC space sim on the old TalkCity IRC network.
2018-11-29 03:37:56	jabooty	Writing has never been my thing, but I've always wanted it to be. I figured this would be a good way to improve :)
2018-11-29 03:38:05	~tomasino	i wanted to give people as much freedom as i could, so the vast distances and times being wonky in the log open up a lot

2018-11-29 03:40:47	alexis	Oh jeez, that's great to know! And, yeah - I haven't yet read most of the updates that are already there; as soon as I saw the premise I was hooked and started writing.
2018-11-29 03:41:08	alexis	I'm kinda saving that, actually...tomorrow at work is probably not going to be great, so I'll be glad to have something to smile about.

2018-11-30 03:55:03	jabooty	saef
2018-11-30 03:55:05	jabooty	sfae
2018-11-30 03:55:07	~tomasino	do you write elsewhere?
2018-11-30 03:55:13	~tomasino	i need more
2018-11-30 03:55:35	alexis	It's a little of both, I suppose. I keep notes in my diary for stories in progress, and I look over those most times before I start writing. But once I do start, I kind of just keep going until I feel like I'm done. It seems to work.
2018-11-30 03:55:54	~tomasino	wow, serious talent there
2018-11-30 03:56:25	jabooty	I feel like I'm back in 3rd grade by comparison.
2018-11-30 03:56:25	alexis	Lately I haven't written much elsewhere that's published. I did another serial story earlier this year, but it's not very much like this is so far being.
2018-11-30 03:56:49	~tomasino	do you want another ship or outpost for the responses?
2018-11-30 03:57:45	alexis	tomasino: I'm not sure. Right now the way I'm thinking about it is, these are basically messages culled from the spools on RS001, and they're organized in a fashion that seems to make sense. Since these are all about Voortrekker, it seems to make sense to have them under that name.
2018-11-30 03:58:03	~tomasino	cool with me
2018-11-30 03:58:28	~tomasino	if you decide you want to have ganymede.earthsys answering, that's cool too
2018-11-30 03:58:54	~tomasino	or Recovery Institute
2018-11-30 03:58:56	~tomasino	or whatever
2018-11-30 04:00:47	~tomasino	i love this chat log. even the time stamps! 
2018-11-30 04:00:49	~tomasino	great work
2018-11-30 04:02:38	alexis	jabooty: Aw jeez, please don't feel bad!
2018-11-30 04:02:47	alexis	Well, I mean.
2018-11-30 04:02:51	alexis	I'm not here to tell you how to be.
2018-11-30 04:03:06	alexis	But I am going to be upset if you decide to stop writing Franciscus. I really want to see where you go with that!
2018-11-30 04:03:12	jabooty	I don't feel bad at all! I'm envious. Gives me something to work toward. ;-)
2018-11-30 04:03:21	alexis	Oh whew OK then!
2018-11-30 04:10:54	~tomasino	do you go by lexie?

2018-11-30 04:12:18	alexis	I haven't really decided what to do with that site. Right now I feel like I'll probably end up generating it from a gopher hole.

2018-11-30 04:13:14	alexis	Thanks! I will.
2018-11-30 04:13:15	~tomasino	i've been collecting some helpful newbie stuff
2018-11-30 04:13:34	alexis	(Also, ECONNREFUSED on tomasino.sdf.org:70...)
2018-11-30 04:13:50	~tomasino	oh, hah...

2018-11-30 04:13:56	~tomasino	it's just a reference to go to gopher
2018-11-30 04:14:02	~tomasino	i do mirror gopher.black on sdf
2018-11-30 04:14:14	~tomasino	same content, but it's at gopher://sdf.org/1/users/tomasino
2018-11-30 04:14:25	~tomasino	less of a literal "use port 70"
2018-11-30 04:14:37	alexis	Ah gotcha.
2018-11-30 04:14:50	~tomasino	yeah, i don't bother with the web all that much
2018-11-30 04:14:56	~tomasino	https://tomasino.org links to all my stuff
2018-11-30 04:16:24	alexis	Oh, this protocol is simple! It shouldn't be hard to write a server.
2018-11-30 04:17:32	alexis	Aaaah, I have to go to bed, though...I mean, I don't want to, but if I don't do it anyway, I'm going to be up till three.
2018-11-30 04:17:33	alexis	Again.
2018-11-30 04:17:49	alexis	I'm really looking forward to seeing more updates soon, though! I really enjoyed reading through them today, and I especially can't wait to find out how more stories are going to start tangenting off one another.
2018-11-30 04:18:34	ben	:)
2018-11-30 04:19:14	ben	i'll try again to write something tonight (like i did last night but ended up ordering a beefy new server?)
2018-11-30 04:20:18	~tomasino	haha, you're all awesome
2018-11-30 04:20:22	~tomasino	night alexis

2018-11-30 04:22:04	ben	might be a bit
2018-11-30 04:22:06	ben	:P

2018-11-30 04:23:06	~tomasino	alexis has a website with a mailto link on it
2018-11-30 04:23:27	jabooty	fancy :)
2018-11-30 04:23:51	~tomasino	pretty fancy. ;)

2018-11-30 04:32:23	~tomasino	i want to write more of my story, but i'm drunk and it would be terrible
2018-11-30 04:32:48	ben	i'm worried that's where i've gotten to

2018-11-30 19:59:49	~tomasino	kensanata: then you will be able to at(1) it, if you want
2018-11-30 20:00:08	~tomasino	oh, there's some bash completion running now that'll autocomplete your ship names for log too. Helpful with -s
2018-11-30 20:00:38	~tomasino	i'll catch up the manpage soon
2018-11-30 20:00:47	~tomasino	about to get on the road for 2 days of driving
2018-11-30 20:04:25	ahriman	tomasino drive safe!
2018-11-30 20:06:10	kensanata	tomasino: yay
2018-11-30 20:06:28	kensanata	two days of driving, not so much yay
2018-11-30 20:06:45	~tomasino	better than one stupidly long one. We're going to break it up with a trip to an aquarium
2018-11-30 20:07:08	ben	how many hours drive total?
2018-11-30 20:07:28	~tomasino	12
2018-11-30 20:07:32	ben	i generally wouldn't bother breaking it up unless it's more than 12

2018-11-30 20:07:36	ben	oh

2018-11-30 20:08:07	ben	you get used to long drives when you grow up in the UP
2018-11-30 20:08:13	~tomasino	it's over 90 decibels in this room
2018-11-30 20:08:22	ben	yuck
2018-11-30 20:08:29	ben	not the only reason then :P
2018-11-30 20:08:31	~tomasino	yeah, so we're gonna bug out a little early and break it up
2018-11-30 20:08:37	ben	8 hours to chicago or detroit
2018-11-30 20:08:42	ben	or minneapolis
2018-11-30 20:08:43	~tomasino	i don't mind a long drive as long as i have a good audiobook
2018-11-30 20:08:44	ben	nothing is close

2018-11-30 20:23:52	~tomasino	I'm not sure if any of you are using it, but the gopher RSS feed is now gopher specific with no <pre> tags and gopher:// links. The web version is all webby
2018-11-30 20:24:07	~tomasino	kensanata: if you're planning on using it for moku-pona, that may help
2018-11-30 20:26:25	ben	nice
2018-11-30 20:56:48	kensanata	Hm, not sure.
2018-11-30 21:00:43	kensanata	Moku Pona uses the Gopher Module 1.0 which I wrote myself so it isn't worth much as a 'standard' but the idea was that I would add a gopher link to the regular feed, or that the feed we're getting from a gopher site would have both links. but perhaps you're right and that isn't really a requirement.
2018-11-30 21:00:55	kensanata	We should just have two different feeds, perhaps.
2018-11-30 21:01:38	~tomasino	 i figured most people using an rss subscription weren't going to have a client that could understand gopher:// links, and if they were getting it off https i might as well point back to https
2018-11-30 21:01:53	~tomasino	but... if you are one of the gopher nerds, i might as well keep the links related to where you got the feed, right?
2018-11-30 21:04:45	kensanata	Yeah. At first I had added the gopher links to my regular feed, but now I'm producing a special feed you can only get via gopher and there having the web link is pretty useless... and thus if I'm not having both kinds of links in the document, there's no need to have the prefix. And that in turn means that you are right and I need to fix Moku Pona!

2018-12-01 11:32:51	peanutbutter144	does anyone know if there is an rss feed for cosmic.voyage?
2018-12-01 11:42:35	kensanata	gophers://cosmic.voyage:7070/0/rss.xml
2018-12-01 11:42:43	kensanata	gopher://cosmic.voyage:70/0/rss.xml
2018-12-01 11:43:00	kensanata	https://cosmic.voyage/rss.xml
2018-12-01 11:43:08	kensanata	So it's all there. :)
2018-12-01 11:44:52	kensanata	I feel bad posting three times in a row. Somebody else post something! I have my next snippet ready.
2018-12-01 11:47:52	peanutbutter144	thanks!
2018-12-01 11:55:33	peanutbutter144	i couldn't find a link to the rss feed on the http site, only on the gopher one btw. is this intentional?
2018-12-01 12:07:47	kensanata	peanutbutter144: actually I think the web site has the regular visible-to-machines indication: <link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Cosmic Voyage" href="/rss.xml">
2018-12-01 12:08:23	kensanata	I would have expected a fully qualified URL but /rss.xml should work as well, as it's relative to the base.
2018-12-01 12:09:37	kensanata	If you care about feeds as a human, like I do, then I have a quick fix for you: a bookmarklet containing a bit of Javascript to make these hidden feed links visible: https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2017-10-22_Show_All_Feeds
2018-12-01 12:33:53	jan6	hey, just inspect element like a normal robot!
2018-12-01 12:33:59	jan6	;P
2018-12-01 12:35:50	peanutbutter144	kensanata: the link you provided is very useful. thanks!

2018-12-01 13:39:15	~tomasino	Heya solderpunk !
2018-12-01 13:39:26	jan6	eya tomasino !
2018-12-01 13:40:01	~tomasino	hiya all
2018-12-01 13:40:02	~tomasino	jan6: 
2018-12-01 13:40:11	~tomasino	yep yep, html & gopher rss both!
2018-12-01 13:40:16	~tomasino	like a bawse
2018-12-01 13:40:57	~tomasino	I'm going to be getting on the road again very soon, but i'm glad solderpunk popped in
2018-12-01 13:41:34	~tomasino	I wanted to talk about how to set up mail relaying between cosmic & the various circumlunar.space domains (and eventually all the other tildes)
2018-12-01 13:43:28	~tomasino	gonna go brush teeth, back in a min
2018-12-01 13:45:17	solderpunk	Ah, hey Tomasino!
2018-12-01 13:46:27	~tomasino	yo yo yo
2018-12-01 13:47:38	~tomasino	solderpunk: ben (demosthenes) helped me get very basic mail stuff set up the other day, but I don't want to enable universal smtp on cosmic. I'd like to lock it down to local & select domains
2018-12-01 13:47:58	~tomasino	i don't mind allowing anyone to mail TO cosmic, at least for now
2018-12-01 13:48:15	~tomasino	i was wondering if there's a right way to do that
2018-12-01 13:48:19	solderpunk	I never imagined that universal smtp access was on the table, it's certainly not from my end.
2018-12-01 13:48:28	solderpunk	Rather, I envisaged a small, hand-curated whitelist.
2018-12-01 13:48:35	~tomasino	yeah, that'd be best
2018-12-01 13:48:50	~tomasino	my mail admin skills are... basic
2018-12-01 13:48:54	solderpunk	I'm happy to let people send mail from the Zaibatsu to Cosmic Voyage, as long as you'll allow them to reply, otherwise it's a bit pointless.
2018-12-01 13:49:00	solderpunk	Are you running Postfix?
2018-12-01 13:49:04	~tomasino	yes
2018-12-01 13:49:35	solderpunk	Okay, I think it should be pretty doable.  Slugmax and I have been planning this for Zaibatsu <-> Republic mail interchange, and plan to test it this weekend.
2018-12-01 13:49:48	~tomasino	fantastic
2018-12-01 13:49:52	solderpunk	I don't think he'll turn up for a while yet, though, it's still early in Canada.
2018-12-01 13:50:05	~tomasino	yeah, no worries
2018-12-01 13:50:10	~tomasino	i just wanted to talk it over
2018-12-01 13:50:23	solderpunk	Cool.
2018-12-01 13:50:26	~tomasino	I think tilde.team has open email in/out, so they're kinda different
2018-12-01 13:50:37	solderpunk	As soon as we have it working reliably, I'll let you know how we did it.
2018-12-01 13:50:38	~tomasino	tilde.town is locked down, i think, if you want to extend to other tildes
2018-12-01 13:50:47	~tomasino	perfect!
2018-12-01 13:51:09	solderpunk	Ah, cool.  Yeah, I would like to permit email with several pubnix servers.
2018-12-01 13:51:34	~tomasino	there's a json tlide list floating around in git that you might be able to reference
2018-12-01 13:52:01	~tomasino	https://tildegit.org/tildeverse/site/src/branch/master/members.json
2018-12-01 13:52:28	~tomasino	heck, you guys could PR and add CS there
2018-12-01 13:52:35	~tomasino	if so inclined
2018-12-01 13:53:11	solderpunk	IIRC ben said he wanted places to have a public IRC presence to qualify as part of the tildeverse.
2018-12-01 13:53:22	~tomasino	gotcha
2018-12-01 13:53:31	solderpunk	Not sure how hard and/or fast that rule is.
2018-12-01 13:54:04	~tomasino	if that list is for that, maybe someone else can maintain a pubnix list for the greater env
2018-12-01 13:54:26	solderpunk	I would really love an "official" name for the wider federated pubnix verse.
2018-12-01 13:55:05	~tomasino	yeah, me too
2018-12-01 13:55:32	~tomasino	like some sort of interconnected webbing or net of servers or something ;)
2018-12-01 13:55:51	solderpunk	Haha.
2018-12-01 13:56:22	solderpunk	Once again, cosmic.voyage is super cool, I'm so happy to see things like this pop up.
2018-12-01 13:56:26	~tomasino	Instead of the information super highway... the information country road?
2018-12-01 13:56:50	~tomasino	:) I'm glad it's getting use
2018-12-01 13:56:57	solderpunk	Talented ones, too!
2018-12-01 13:56:59	~tomasino	i was a little worried that nobody would do anything at first
2018-12-01 13:57:12	~tomasino	oh hells yes. i love the different styles people are using too
2018-12-01 13:58:04	solderpunk	I'll sign up once I can figure out exactly how I want to flesh out my crazy idea of rich eccentric space history re-enactment geeks living in a painstakingly accurate replica of a Soviet-era Soyuz spacestation :p
2018-12-01 13:58:17	solderpunk	Err, Salyut.
2018-12-01 13:58:36	~tomasino	oh wow
2018-12-01 13:58:37	~tomasino	hahah
2018-12-01 13:58:41	~tomasino	that's going to be amazing
2018-12-01 13:58:48	~tomasino	call each other comrade?
2018-12-01 13:58:57	solderpunk	Oh, absolutely.
2018-12-01 14:01:11	~tomasino	i wonder the best way to survey people for a name for the pubnix verse
2018-12-01 14:01:18	solderpunk	Just need to figure out exactly why/how they are doing this as part of some kind of near-light-speed migration away from an abandoned Earth.
2018-12-01 14:02:01	~tomasino	too many poor people? ultimate gated community?
2018-12-01 14:02:41	~tomasino	now that they have robot slaves, everyone can be equal in their community!
2018-12-01 14:02:45	~tomasino	hah
2018-12-01 14:03:18	solderpunk	Doesn't sound like good communist ideology :p
2018-12-01 14:03:29	~tomasino	hmm, true
2018-12-01 14:03:36	~tomasino	i'm sure you'll come up with something great
2018-12-01 14:03:49	solderpunk	I'll definitely keep thinking about it.
2018-12-01 14:03:56	~tomasino	want me to create your user while I'm around?
2018-12-01 14:04:03	~tomasino	you can add your ship/colony/outpost later
2018-12-01 14:04:46	solderpunk	Sure, why not?
2018-12-01 14:04:58	solderpunk	You need a ssh public key, right?
2018-12-01 14:05:48	~tomasino	yep!

2018-12-01 14:11:23	solderpunk	Ah, cool, it's so great that people can see under the hood!
2018-12-01 14:11:45	~tomasino	that's half the fun, right?
2018-12-01 14:12:04	~tomasino	if you need anything installed to help you work, say the word
2018-12-01 14:12:12	~tomasino	i've got a few shells installed, a few editors, etc
2018-12-01 14:14:42	solderpunk	Will do!
2018-12-01 14:15:06	~tomasino	btw, i've got ircd running there, connecting to the tilde.chat chain, along with weechat and irssi
2018-12-01 14:15:11	~tomasino	in case SDF gets funky for you
2018-12-01 14:16:41	solderpunk	Oh, that'll be handy.  I'm pretty n00bish at IRC, and because the tildeverse servers insist on TLS for external connections (rightly so!) it always takes me a while to connect from SDF.
2018-12-01 14:17:26	solderpunk	I'm slowly learning more, though, I do want the Zaibatsu and Republic to have an IRC network.
2018-12-01 14:17:49	~tomasino	ahha, you can connect to tildeverse via 6667 via localhost
2018-12-01 14:17:59	~tomasino	so you can cheat
2018-12-01 14:18:22	~tomasino	i'll be honest, the irc setup was probably the worst part of the thing
2018-12-01 14:18:35	~tomasino	i'm not really sure what's going on with it. It installs weird
2018-12-01 14:18:43	~tomasino	and i'm interconnecting with ben's stuff
2018-12-01 14:18:48	~tomasino	but hey, it's cool!
2018-12-01 14:18:55	solderpunk	Which ircd are you using?
2018-12-01 14:19:03	~tomasino	inspircd
2018-12-01 14:19:18	~tomasino	it's working now, but yeesh
2018-12-01 14:20:42	solderpunk	The Zaibatsu is using ngircd, very literally because I did `apt-cache search ircd` and it was the only result with "lightweight" in its description. :p
2018-12-01 14:21:05	~tomasino	haha
2018-12-01 14:21:07	~tomasino	smart
2018-12-01 14:21:30	solderpunk	Ah, slugmax is awake.  I'm gonna focus on mail stuff with him for now, will hopefully get back to you with good news in the near future!
2018-12-01 14:21:40	~tomasino	cheers!
2018-12-01 14:21:44	~tomasino	i'm about to hop on the road

2018-12-01 14:57:50	jan6	de-facto it's tildeverse
2018-12-01 14:59:30	jan6	but you can just put a little poll on a page, and whatever-is-most-used-method-of-communication + irc + mail
2018-12-01 17:32:02	alexis	So, I was up all night drinking Irish coffees and hacking on a combined gopher/http server that I'm probably going to mostly drop in favor of generating static files...but while I was doing that, it occurred to me, has anyone thought about the causality violation inherent in this setting? I feel like that's rich with potential...
2018-12-01 17:32:49	alexis	(I also realized I goofed the time dilation in my Voortrekker updates - treated Sol and Ross 128 as if in the same reference frame, despite Voortrekker's relativistic travel. I have to update that today, as soon as I figure out what the delta would be. As soon as I figure out how to figure that out...)

2018-12-01 23:08:38	~tomasino	alexis, oh yes, causality is ripe for abuse!
2018-12-01 23:10:54	~tomasino	i'm going to play with time-slipping in the q-bit pairing eventually. Basically, a ship that was at such a near-light speed and did some other funky business that it still appears in flight to Earth but messages are coming back already from the far-distant future & place
2018-12-01 23:11:14	~tomasino	something to that effect, anyway
2018-12-01 23:11:20	~tomasino	but not with this ship
2018-12-01 23:12:43	~tomasino	only 2 years of time debt on Voortrekker?
2018-12-01 23:13:03	alexis	That reminds me of another question I had. I remember reading somewhere that one possible property of this sort of quantum-entanglement "spooky action at a distance" is that it's not possible to eavesdrop without rendering the message illegible, or preventing it being delivered, if at all. Does the communication scheme in use here share that property?
2018-12-01 23:13:50	~tomasino	hrm, possibly... let me rant a bit about what I was envisioning for the QEC but haven't spelled out explicitly
2018-12-01 23:14:06	alexis	(And, yeah...honestly, I'm not sure that's terribly plausible, but I don't understand the underlying mathematics well enough to gainsay the webpage calculator thing I found that spat out that figure. I may have written myself into a corner with the original 25-year time debt, but I don't mind handwaving constant-boost engines and inertial compensation if I have to. :) )
2018-12-01 23:14:10	~tomasino	one sec, kid asking for help
2018-12-01 23:14:21	alexis	Oh, take your time! No worries.
2018-12-01 23:15:15	~tomasino	okay, the QEC!
2018-12-01 23:15:27	~tomasino	the relay is a qbit entanglement factory
2018-12-01 23:15:47	~tomasino	each connected machine to the relay communicates through a pre-entangled transmission node
2018-12-01 23:16:04	~tomasino	that node is extremely simple and is used to communicate in serial fashion the desire for new pairings
2018-12-01 23:16:56	~tomasino	the message is fed in and the QEC magic pairs new qbits locally & remote in next-to-real time
2018-12-01 23:17:13	~tomasino	those pairs are now set and can't be unpaired, hence the no-delete function
2018-12-01 23:17:19	~tomasino	but the message can be augmented
2018-12-01 23:17:50	~tomasino	there's not really a way to intercept since there's nothing paired except the transmision node until the messages are logged
2018-12-01 23:18:18	~tomasino	all of this was floating in my head and destined for the log(1) manpage at some point
2018-12-01 23:18:39	~tomasino	but if your story needs to drift away from it, we can fuzz some sciency stuff to make it work
2018-12-01 23:19:00	~tomasino	or maybe your branch of people developed some new tech that sits atop the old QEC and changed it in some way
2018-12-01 23:19:37	alexis	Nah, I just had a couple of my own ideas floating around that would work really well with that eavesdropping-resistant or -immune property. Nothing that couldn't be adjusted to accommodate - after all, encryption is still a thing, magic physics aside!
2018-12-01 23:20:27	~tomasino	i think the important thing is that all comms go through the relay
2018-12-01 23:20:38	~tomasino	so if you just read the relay you can see anything
2018-12-01 23:20:57	~tomasino	private comms need to be encrypted if they use the QEC, otherwise it's universally readable
2018-12-01 23:21:56	alexis	I wouldn't expect there to be only one relay as a single point of failure for the entire system. Governments, for example, I can see having a very hard time with that idea. Although if an installation on the scale of RS001 is both extremely difficult and expensive to build, and vitally necessary for a wide relay network to function at all, I can see that they'd accommodate themselves to it rather than not have FTL c
2018-12-01 23:21:56	alexis	omms capability at all.
2018-12-01 23:22:39	~tomasino	there are other relays as well, but the earliest ships that launched had QECs paired with RS001
2018-12-01 23:22:50	alexis	Ahh, gotcha, OK.
2018-12-01 23:23:15	alexis	This reminds me of another another question I had. Do you know if anyone actually got to unwrapping the base64 blob in that one update I did, and worked out what was in it?
2018-12-01 23:23:16	~tomasino	and maybe someone is logging in-system traffic back to RS001 as a backup
2018-12-01 23:23:41	~tomasino	I un-base64'd it and it looked like the contents of your first message being forwarded in the email to your new people
2018-12-01 23:23:51	alexis	Yup, that's what it was. Just curious whether anyone had taken it that far.
2018-12-01 23:24:19	~tomasino	once i saw the base64 header i knew what to do. at first i thought you might have gpg'd it or something, but didn't see a key
2018-12-01 23:24:51	~tomasino	i giggled with glee when i did it too
2018-12-01 23:25:06	alexis	I've assumed that in-system traffic would pass through RS001 (or another QEC relay), depending on destination. Stuff between Sam at L1 and Lia at Ganymede, for example. I don't know offhand what the light delay is from there to here, but I did get the sense there was enough excess bandwidth on the QEC network to support it. (Also, that gave me an excuse to include those messages in the story!)
2018-12-01 23:25:41	~tomasino	yes. I had envisioned the QEC having nearly unlimited bandwidth, but extremely low baud, if that makes sense
2018-12-01 23:25:56	~tomasino	volume is irrelevant, but pretty much only text is worth sending
2018-12-01 23:26:21	alexis	It does! And in that case you did an excellent job of describing it both accurately and concisely, because that was the impression I got from the cosmic.voyage top level.
2018-12-01 23:26:50	~tomasino	sa-weet
2018-12-01 23:27:05	~tomasino	33 min from earth to jupiter, or thereabouts
2018-12-01 23:27:06	~tomasino	btw
2018-12-01 23:27:22	alexis	Ah, that's not so bad. Still would be prohibitive for realtime chat, though.
2018-12-01 23:27:23	~tomasino	for instant-messaging, they'd DEFINITELY use the QEC
2018-12-01 23:27:29	~tomasino	:)
2018-12-01 23:27:31	alexis	Well, real-ish time. Real enough.
2018-12-01 23:27:59	~tomasino	i'm not planning on addressing what happened to earth
2018-12-01 23:28:13	~tomasino	i'm thinking that might be a good "best practice" for everyone
2018-12-01 23:28:26	alexis	Hmm.
2018-12-01 23:28:29	~tomasino	we can't really step on each other's toes out in space, but if someone decides the earth blew up....
2018-12-01 23:28:41	alexis	I might have taken that 'Earth is a distant memory' less literally than would have been ideal, in that case.
2018-12-01 23:28:56	alexis	Not that I've blown it up, or anything!
2018-12-01 23:29:10	alexis	But it's still a going concern at the time in which my story is set.
2018-12-01 23:29:12	~tomasino	well, if we just infer that's not so bad
2018-12-01 23:29:52	khuxkm	we all left the Earth because something happened
2018-12-01 23:30:01	khuxkm	what happened can be local
2018-12-01 23:30:07	alexis	That's fair.
2018-12-01 23:30:08	~tomasino	you think?
2018-12-01 23:30:13	~tomasino	okay
2018-12-01 23:30:29	khuxkm	(for example, the Excelsior's home station left Earth because of a war destroying their homeland)
2018-12-01 23:30:35	alexis	I mean, I don't know that I'd make a rule of it, but most of my colonists are leaving Earth for reasons.
2018-12-01 23:30:46	alexis	Mostly not happy-go-lucky ST:TNG type reasons.
2018-12-01 23:30:48	~tomasino	you know when you go to take a drink from your coffee cup and look down just in time to see a spider floating in it?
2018-12-01 23:30:54	khuxkm	ohno
2018-12-01 23:30:57	alexis	Oh yes! I'm always glad when that happens.
2018-12-01 23:31:01	~tomasino	i'm thinking earth had something like that happen and we were all like NOPE! and left
2018-12-01 23:31:11	alexis	I'd hate to think of a poor spider drowning in my cup of coffee.
2018-12-01 23:31:44	~tomasino	okay, just a "don't blow up the earth" rule then
2018-12-01 23:31:46	~tomasino	;)
2018-12-01 23:31:49	khuxkm	yep
2018-12-01 23:32:18	alexis	"Don't blow up the Earth, or we'll retroactively declare that you did something goofy with a reality drive and blew up the Earth in the universe next door to ours."
2018-12-01 23:32:21	khuxkm	the only story rule: if a disaster made you leave earth, make it localized. under no circumstances can you blow up the fucking Earth
2018-12-01 23:32:43	khuxkm	i like mine better :P
2018-12-01 23:32:49	alexis	Mm. I don't know if it even has to be localized, as long as it's not something that's going to stomp all over someone else's backstory.
2018-12-01 23:32:58	khuxkm	true
2018-12-01 23:32:58	~tomasino	maybe that's more in spirit
2018-12-01 23:33:13	~tomasino	"If disaster made you leave earth, don't make it step on other people's stories'
2018-12-01 23:33:17	khuxkm	yep
2018-12-01 23:33:27	alexis	👍
2018-12-01 23:33:31	~tomasino	and we always have reality drive backup plans
2018-12-01 23:33:48	~tomasino	but if we have to use it, everyone in your story is getting a goatee. Sorry.
2018-12-01 23:33:57	alexis	That seems fair.
2018-12-01 23:34:03	khuxkm	so the Excelsior's backstory (which probably will never be fully explored) has a war leading to the United States Space Corps (an offshoot of NASA) taking to space
2018-12-01 23:34:26	alexis	May I ask in what Earth time you plan to set, about?
2018-12-01 23:34:34	khuxkm	whether or not the war fully destroyed Earth/the US is definitely not explored
2018-12-01 23:34:43	khuxkm	alexis: idk, very far into the future
2018-12-01 23:35:14	alexis	Gotcha. Asking because I'm in ~2421 on Earth, and am entirely unaverse to setting up backstories that play into one another somewhat.
2018-12-01 23:35:29	alexis	Well, ~2421 in Sol, I should properly say.
2018-12-01 23:35:36	khuxkm	but my idea is that if someone else's backstory requires an intact US, then the war leading to the evacuation of the US by the Space Corps didn't destroy things
2018-12-01 23:35:37	~tomasino	2483 was Melchy's mission start
2018-12-01 23:36:10	khuxkm	still trying to figure out where to put Alpha Alpha 1 Alpha on the normal Earth calendar
2018-12-01 23:36:54	~tomasino	i just kinda fudged a time and didn't specify how fast we were traveling or anyhing
2018-12-01 23:37:32	~tomasino	3781 earth time as of Melchizedek's first transmission
2018-12-01 23:38:03	~tomasino	but the fuzzy logic of the QEC has our logs coming back in line with you guys
2018-12-01 23:38:07	~tomasino	cause... reasons!
2018-12-01 23:38:54	alexis	Hmm. Everybody might end up with goatees in mine, then. Eleven light-years in 25 Earth years, in retrospect, was pushing my luck real hard, considering that Melchizedek left after Voortrekker and has been something like four hundred times as long in transit.
2018-12-01 23:39:22	~tomasino	i wouldn't fret it
2018-12-01 23:39:26	~tomasino	very different drive types
2018-12-01 23:39:35	khuxkm	I may just give up on the Stardate idea since it's going to be hard to manage
2018-12-01 23:39:54	alexis	See, you say that, but you weren't the one who spent an hour writing date-fixing code in your story file this afternoon...
2018-12-01 23:40:24	khuxkm	:P
2018-12-01 23:40:45	~tomasino	haha
2018-12-01 23:40:51	~tomasino	stick with your date-fixed time
2018-12-01 23:40:57	khuxkm	I like the voortrekker's kind of email style and I think I may try to take a look at that for some logs
2018-12-01 23:40:57	~tomasino	i'll spin somethin funky about my drive
2018-12-01 23:41:10	~tomasino	and i can use the qubit slipping thing i mentioned
2018-12-01 23:41:25	khuxkm	how does date-fixing work? I'm completely lost on how to do a good-looking normal date/time
2018-12-01 23:41:29	alexis	Fair, and thanks! Sorry to have complicated things - I got a little ahead of myself, not gonna lie.
2018-12-01 23:41:43	~tomasino	it's 3781 in Earth time according to Melchizedek's computer, but our pairing is effectively connecting our messages to the past
2018-12-01 23:42:13	alexis	khuxkm: I mean, I just wrote some code that lets me select a date and invoke a function that corrects it either forward or back by the two-and-change-year delta between Sol and Ross 128. The format doesn't change or anything.
2018-12-01 23:42:32	alexis	Oh! Gotcha. Sorry, I had the idea it was 3781 in Melchizedek's frame.
2018-12-01 23:43:05	alexis	Of course, that means it's probably a lot later in Earth's.
2018-12-01 23:43:26	~tomasino	nah, Melchi is probably earlier
2018-12-01 23:43:30	~tomasino	gotta do some maths
2018-12-01 23:43:58	~tomasino	travelled 24 light years or so
2018-12-01 23:44:04	~tomasino	gotta think how fast we were going
2018-12-01 23:44:19	~tomasino	1300 years in relative time = what...
2018-12-01 23:44:33	khuxkm|lounge	so how exactly is this relay working?
2018-12-01 23:44:35	~tomasino	is there a relativistic speed calculator online or am i going to have to build it?
2018-12-01 23:44:40	alexis	Sec -
2018-12-01 23:44:46	~tomasino	khuxkm|lounge: did you see my blurb earlier in chat?
2018-12-01 23:44:54	khuxkm|lounge	so we can receive messages that come before we send ours?
2018-12-01 23:44:55	~tomasino	i kinda explained my theory on it
2018-12-01 23:45:14	alexis	I used http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/, but I have no idea what backs it. Building one might not be the worst idea in the world; I'd have done it myself, but my math isn't really up to that.
2018-12-01 23:45:25	~tomasino	technically the relay is storing and sharing messages it gets in "real, local time"
2018-12-01 23:45:33	~tomasino	but if your travel has thrown you off 
2018-12-01 23:45:39	~tomasino	or reality drive got involved
2018-12-01 23:45:52	~tomasino	or you have slippery chronology in your qbits, all things get weird
2018-12-01 23:46:05	~tomasino	and i made a note in the man page for "log"....
2018-12-01 23:46:05	alexis	I pretty much topped out at working out there isn't any difference between a constant velocity v over the entire trip, and a constant boost with a turnover in the middle where the velocity averages out to v over the whole trip.
2018-12-01 23:46:19	~tomasino	 Systems with abundant quantities of exotic or phase-shifted matter may  encounter  delays
2018-12-01 23:46:21	~tomasino	       in  communication,  time  shifting,  and  rare  cases, a reverse in localized time of log
2018-12-01 23:46:23	~tomasino	       receipts.
2018-12-01 23:47:24	~tomasino	one person was considering writing a story that gets logged in reverse due to **SCIENCE**
2018-12-01 23:47:37	alexis	That would be awesome!
2018-12-01 23:47:51	~tomasino	i agree
2018-12-01 23:48:03	khuxkm|lounge	so now I wanna work on a script to figure out how many days will have passed since Alpha Alpha 1 Alpha :P
2018-12-01 23:50:08	~tomasino	oh, this calculator is great
2018-12-01 23:51:42	~tomasino	1.875% lightspeed for 24.33 years, local time = 1297 years earth relative
2018-12-01 23:52:13	~tomasino	time & distance dialation!
2018-12-01 23:53:01	alexis	Er...
2018-12-01 23:53:17	alexis	1297.6 years as viewed from Earth, 1297.3 years from the reference frame of the ship.
2018-12-01 23:53:50	alexis	So a little over a three-month delta.
2018-12-01 23:54:33	~tomasino	oh poop
2018-12-01 23:54:36	~tomasino	neverminde
2018-12-01 23:54:41	~tomasino	page rendering stupid
2018-12-01 23:54:47	~tomasino	need to go MUCH faster
2018-12-01 23:54:49	~tomasino	;)
2018-12-01 23:55:04	alexis	Yeah. I ended up at .43c equivalent constant velocity, which is what has me feeling I may have not thought it all the way through...
2018-12-01 23:55:33	~tomasino	i guess it's not just about the speed
2018-12-01 23:55:37	~tomasino	something else in the mix
2018-12-01 23:56:11	~tomasino	maybe some gravity tweaking
2018-12-01 23:56:40	~tomasino	ahh, there we go
2018-12-01 23:56:45	~tomasino	gravitational time dilation drive
2018-12-01 23:57:10	~tomasino	my ship could only make 1.875% light speed, but we had gravitational warping slowing our internal time down dramatically
2018-12-01 23:57:30	~tomasino	that plus cryo = weird
2018-12-01 23:57:34	~tomasino	now to write about it
2018-12-01 23:57:52	alexis	Black-hole-on-a-leash drive. I love it!
2018-12-01 23:58:11	~tomasino	:)
2018-12-01 23:58:14	~tomasino	super safe
2018-12-01 23:59:52	~tomasino	oooh, gonna have fun with this and make up new terms
2018-12-02 00:00:20	~tomasino	and it'll be a good way to acknowledge the time shifting
2018-12-02 00:00:27	~tomasino	back in a bit
2018-12-02 00:00:49	alexis	Enjoy!
2018-12-02 00:03:05	khuxkm	also how should I work on time between messages?
2018-12-02 00:03:19	alexis	How do you mean?
2018-12-02 00:03:20	khuxkm	since the Excelsior will often reference other messages
2018-12-02 00:03:30	khuxkm	that have hit the relay since it last transmitted
2018-12-02 00:03:42	khuxkm	so how many days should I put between transmissions
2018-12-02 00:03:54	khuxkm	also currently fixing the stardate on transmission 1
2018-12-02 00:04:35	~tomasino	Melchi's been transmitting each day for our first 3
2018-12-02 00:04:46	~tomasino	I've not noted anything further than the Year to date, though
2018-12-02 00:04:51	~tomasino	so you can fudge if you need
2018-12-02 00:05:21	khuxkm	alright
2018-12-02 00:05:55	khuxkm	I'm just going to say that wobbly time means the Excelsior can read all messages sent to the QEC between transmissions no matter how long the transmissions are apart :P
2018-12-02 00:06:26	khuxkm	it may not be consistent but does it really need to be?
2018-12-02 00:06:44	alexis	That seems consistent to me.
2018-12-02 00:07:14	khuxkm	so I'm going to publish a repo for dealing with Excelsior-esque stardates (just because I like making up date formats)
2018-12-02 00:07:25	alexis	Nice! I hope you'll link it here when you do.
2018-12-02 00:07:29	khuxkm	it includes a text file documenting how they work
2018-12-02 00:08:13	khuxkm	I've also fixed the stardate on Transmission 1 (should've been Beta Delta 21 Epsilon, not Beta Gamma 51 Epsilon)
2018-12-02 00:08:30	alexis	Hmm. I might've saved myself some effort going with regular Gregorian-style dates, after all. :)
2018-12-02 00:08:54	~tomasino	awesome!
2018-12-02 00:09:05	khuxkm	tomasino: can you regen web/rss please? :P
2018-12-02 00:09:19	alexis	You should be able to do that now by invoking `cosmic-web`.
2018-12-02 00:09:20	khuxkm	I changed my transmission and I don't think the change propagated
2018-12-02 00:09:28	alexis	I know that does the web stuff; I don't know if it does RSS, but I suppose I'd be surprised if it did not.
2018-12-02 00:09:30	khuxkm	ooh
2018-12-02 00:09:31	~tomasino	you can run it yourself now: cosmic-web
2018-12-02 00:09:46	~tomasino	and yes, it'll do RSS as well
2018-12-02 00:10:36	khuxkm	thanks!
2018-12-02 00:23:16	ben	maybe log(1) could invoke cosmic-web when it's done?
2018-12-02 00:26:37	~tomasino	sure could
2018-12-02 00:27:01	~tomasino	;)
2018-12-02 00:28:03	kensanata	alexis: I was also hoping for some extra content in the base64 encoding and thought it was an *awesome* idea. :)
2018-12-02 00:34:51	kensanata	To be honest, all the time effects confused me. If *people* get to communicate then our cryo sleep and all that need to happen in some sort of synchronicity or something, I felt. And then I figured I was going to handwave it all like they do in bad/all science fiction movies.
2018-12-02 00:35:21	kensanata	So nwo my main problem is: why is nobody else posting?
2018-12-02 00:35:42	kensanata	I have a new installment waiting for over 24h but don't want three stories in a row.
2018-12-02 00:36:20	alexis	Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I was up all night drinking Irish coffee and writing a gopher service, so I'm pretty wiped and going to bed soon. I intend to write a new installment tomorrow, if that helps at all.
2018-12-02 00:37:11	kensanata	Well, it's 1:36am over here and I definitely need to sleep, too.
2018-12-02 00:37:18	kensanata	See you all tomorrow. :)
2018-12-02 00:37:26	alexis	'Night!

2018-12-02 02:43:58	khuxkm	any ideas for commands?
2018-12-02 03:48:36	~tomasino	commands for the bot?
2018-12-02 03:48:45	~tomasino	does it run on cosmic?
2018-12-02 03:49:00	~tomasino	if so, can you have it run the roster command and output it here?
2018-12-02 03:51:53	fosslinux	^
2018-12-02 03:52:18	~tomasino	roster by itself shows all users and their ships. If you pass any param to it, it'll grep that list (insensitive) and show the results
2018-12-02 03:52:27	~tomasino	so it's great for looking up who is writing which ship
2018-12-02 03:53:13	~tomasino	roster count # special thing that just shows the number of ships by user
2018-12-02 03:54:52	~tomasino	any commands or tools on the server that you all want?
2018-12-02 03:55:30	~tomasino	i'm working on making a non-interactive mode for log where you provide all the info in switches so you can script it or whatever
2018-12-02 05:29:33	khuxkm|lounge	so !roster -> run cosmic-roster
2018-12-02 05:30:02	khuxkm|lounge	I also want to give cosmicbot a cosmic.voyage vhost

2018-12-02 19:10:07	alexis	'This' being Cosmic Voyage as a whole? Yes, very much so.
2018-12-02 19:10:30	hyperboredoubt	Cool.
2018-12-02 19:10:33	hyperboredoubt	Hi, alexis.
2018-12-02 19:10:37	alexis	Hi!
2018-12-02 19:10:48	jan6	o7
2018-12-02 19:11:46	hyperboredoubt	Hi, jan6.
2018-12-02 19:11:57	hyperboredoubt	What is new in Cosmic Voyage?
2018-12-02 19:13:08	jan6	since when?
2018-12-02 19:13:37	hyperboredoubt	Since ever.
2018-12-02 19:13:44	alexis	Most recently, Melchizedek (tomasino) has established some parameters of the setting that were somewhat inchoate before, and Hoffnung (kensanata) has declared independence from her shareholders and reconstituted herself as an anarchocommunist commune.
2018-12-02 19:14:04	hyperboredoubt	I should join the anarchists. :)
2018-12-02 19:14:20	alexis	But I'd really recommend reading the updates directly at gopher://cosmic.voyage or https://cosmic.voyage.
2018-12-02 19:14:51	alexis	If you're interested in a ship of your own, tomasino is whom to talk with about that. He's traveling at the moment, but IIRC he means to check in later today? I might be wrong about that, though.
2018-12-02 19:15:26	alexis	And, considering that QEC messages are (generally considered to be) delivered to all ships as soon as they arrive on RS001, I wouldn't be surprised if yours weren't the only ship to find Hoffnung's latest update inspiring!
2018-12-02 19:20:04	hyperboredoubt	Are there any specific roleplaying limits?
2018-12-02 19:20:57	alexis	If you blow up the Earth, your story is automatically taking place in a different universe from everyone else's, as a result of a reality drive mishap. In that universe, everyone, without exception, has a goatee.
2018-12-02 19:21:21	hyperboredoubt	Haha. :)
2018-12-02 19:22:29	alexis	That's all we've really established thus far. 'Reality drive' exists in the setting, as a shorthand for a form of propulsion which does weird things to continuity and causality even beyond what comes with the existence of FTL communications. But I don't think anyone has used it yet; if anyone has done, it's not obvious to me that they are. In general, though, it's a very open setting.
2018-12-02 19:23:09	hyperboredoubt	I'd like to try my hand at an A.I. or a hivemind/transhuman.
2018-12-02 19:23:18	alexis	That would be brilliant.

2018-12-02 19:50:49	hyperboredoubt	What bot?
2018-12-02 19:52:01	alexis	cosmicbot.
2018-12-02 19:55:33	hyperboredoubt	What is cosmicbot?
2018-12-02 19:57:28	alexis	fosslinux: Which version(s) of Python does that bot run under?
2018-12-02 19:59:09	fosslinux	idk
2018-12-02 19:59:26	alexis	Fair. It might not matter anyway.
2018-12-02 19:59:30	fosslinux	khuxkm:
2018-12-02 19:59:36	fosslinux	khuxkm|lounge:
2018-12-02 19:59:42	fosslinux	khuxkm is the maintainer of the bot
2018-12-02 19:59:53	fosslinux	alexis: there is a such thing as a python{2,3} compatible program
2018-12-02 20:00:35	alexis	Indeed - hence 'version(s)'. But it may well be that the syntax for what I want to do doesn't differ between versions in any case.
2018-12-02 20:00:47	fosslinux	what do you want to do
2018-12-02 20:01:22	alexis	Insert a Unicode zero-width space after the first character of each username in the roster and elsewhere, so that they don't highlight the named users if those users use the same names here.
2018-12-02 20:03:41	alexis	Yeah, the Unicode literal escape syntax is the same in both, looks like.
2018-12-02 20:11:56	jan6	"ython{2,3} compatible program" there is 2to3 converters and stuff ;P
2018-12-02 20:12:23	jan6	use 3 if possible, generally
2018-12-02 20:13:10	alexis	Sure. But in this case, I'm not originating the program or running the bot, and so it's not up to me on what version of Python it runs.
2018-12-02 20:13:45	alexis	Ideally, the changes I make will be compatible with both, but if that's not possible or requires an undue amount of effort, it'll help to know which I actually need to target.
2018-12-02 20:22:01	 *	kensanata waves
2018-12-02 20:22:24	kensanata	Less bots, more story updates!
2018-12-02 20:24:59	hyperboredoubt	Maybe.
2018-12-02 20:26:07	kensanata	Some days I dream about a kind of text adventure that feels more like playing Skyrim. It wouldn't focus on combat, and maybe it'd be a lot like a MUD/MUSH, I don't know. Unlike a MUD/MUSH, people would collaboratively write stuff but there'd be a sort of unifying vision to it all. The end result would feel like Skyrim. And it could be Science Fiction.
2018-12-02 20:26:46	kensanata	I've been trying to convince a programmer I know who was writing a Science Fiction game involving some programming as part of the game to expand in that direction, and I've been writing five or six example missions.
2018-12-02 20:26:53	alexis	I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'feel like Skyrim', although that may just be because New Vegas is the closest I've ever gotten to actually playing that game.
2018-12-02 20:27:05	alexis	Also, I adore your latest update.
2018-12-02 20:27:25	kensanata	Heh, and I don't know New Vegas. :)
2018-12-02 20:27:34	kensanata	Here are the examples I wrote: https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/bussard/tree/stories?h=alex
2018-12-02 20:27:40	kensanata	Start with "waking-up".
2018-12-02 20:27:51	alexis	Same engine, I think not that different in overall concept - it's an open-ended main quest with lots of side stuff. Very like Fallout 2 in that way.
2018-12-02 20:27:59	kensanata	Ah.
2018-12-02 20:28:06	alexis	Oh yes! I saw some mention of that on your blog, I think, but didn't have time then to look closely at it.
2018-12-02 20:28:18	kensanata	Exactly. Main quest, side quests, "open world".
2018-12-02 20:29:02	alexis	Hmm. I'm going to have to clone this and try it out.
2018-12-02 20:29:07	kensanata	But I'm not interested in random encounters like in traditional RPGs. I think Text Elite shows how weird combat is in a text medium.
2018-12-02 20:29:30	kensanata	alexis: Actually, don't bother. Right now he has rewritten it using a different programming language and it doesn't do much.
2018-12-02 20:29:34	alexis	Ah, OK.
2018-12-02 20:29:42	kensanata	alexis: But the previous one, let me see whether I can find it...
2018-12-02 20:30:26	kensanata	https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard
2018-12-02 20:30:58	hyperboredoubt	Kensata, those are called MOOs.
2018-12-02 20:31:04	alexis	Ugh. There's got to be a cleaner way of dealing with syntax differences in Python 2 vs. 3 than dispatching on sys.version_info[0] to decide what file to import...
2018-12-02 20:31:13	kensanata	Heh.
2018-12-02 20:31:20	alexis	hyperboredoubt: How does a MOO differ from a MUSH or a MUCK? I'm familiar with both of the latter, but not the former.
2018-12-02 20:31:32	alexis	In particular, I'm curious how it supports the kind of collaborative authorship that kensanata describes.
2018-12-02 20:31:38	kensanata	I have a tool I wanted to port from Python 2 to Python 3 (and me not being a Python crack) and so I gave up. 
2018-12-02 20:32:00	alexis	I mean, I've participated in the same general sort of thing on a MUCK before, but without a great deal of scripting effort, there's not much most of them do to support it, really.
2018-12-02 20:32:56	alexis	And, oh well, I guess this is good enough to be going on with - I don't really understand Python well, either. It works, anyway. I'll open the PR and find out what khuxkm thinks of it.
2018-12-02 20:33:00	kensanata	I've scripted small adventures on a MUD, and I've played quite a bit on a MUSH when I was younger, but I don't enjoy that kind of gameplay anymore, I think.
2018-12-02 20:33:25	kensanata	The MUD had a lot of combat and levelling up; the MUSH only had interesting stuff going on when other people joined...
2018-12-02 20:33:42	kensanata	I guess with strong editorial control a MUSH might actually work, though.
2018-12-02 20:34:00	hyperboredoubt	MOOs are more... roleplay/chat orientent, less hack and slash. Think the Hogwarts dormatories versus Dungeons and Dragons.
2018-12-02 20:34:19	alexis	I'm not sure it would be the ideal option. I mean, my earliest collaborative fiction adventures were on a MUCK mainly just because it was the least worst platform I could find at the time.
2018-12-02 20:34:28	kensanata	Haha
2018-12-02 20:34:51	kensanata	I still worry about how to turn a story idea into useful data for a game engine.
2018-12-02 20:34:53	hyperboredoubt	And I may be getting MUSH and MOO confused, lol.
2018-12-02 20:35:09	alexis	hyperboredoubt: That's like MUCKs and MUSHes, too. But there wasn't a lot of platform support for it, if that makes sense. Like you could do it, but it was very ephemeral unless you went to a lot of work to preserve it, and a lot of that work had to do with overcoming platform limitations that made the job harder than it strictly speaking needed to be.
2018-12-02 20:36:03	alexis	Indeed, my earliest exposure to a Lispish language was from getting familiar with one MUCK's scripting language, and figuring out how to make it do things it was never intended to, so I could create story repositories that could be shared and collaboratively edited.
2018-12-02 20:36:11	kensanata	Heh.
2018-12-02 20:36:23	alexis	Which was useful experience! But it sucked. It'd be nice to work with something that doesn't have to be beat on so hard to make it do what I need it to. :D
2018-12-02 20:36:29	hyperboredoubt	There are still several famous ones still alive. I think "HellMoo" and "CoffeMuck" are still pretty active.
2018-12-02 20:36:51	kensanata	Also, these days I think authors would want the support of git and their favorite text editors. Just editing a live database while in-game would be considered a terrible programming environment.
2018-12-02 20:38:20	jan6	                         | MUD/MUSH, people would collaboratively write stuff but there'd be a sort of unifying vision to
2018-12-02 20:38:26	jan6	that's what a MUSH *IS*
2018-12-02 20:38:58	hyperboredoubt	Hmmm, I wonder if there is a Harry Potter one... I know the World Of Darkness has a lot of them.
2018-12-02 20:39:03	alexis	kensanata: I agree.
2018-12-02 20:40:25	hyperboredoubt	I'll try to get a Cosmic Voyage account later tonight or this week.
2018-12-02 20:40:57	jan6	mushes have "zones" nowdays, and as such you can have permissions per area or per object, or kinda however you want
2018-12-02 20:40:58	alexis	There should be an email address on the toplevel that you can use to request an account. That goes to tomasino, who is IIRC still traveling, so it may take a minute to hear back.
2018-12-02 20:41:15	alexis	(hyperboredoubt ↑)
2018-12-02 20:41:24	kensanata	I'm trying to figure out where one would get the version of Bussard before the rewrite -- where the engine was better but there was no plot to speak of.
2018-12-02 20:41:27	kensanata	https://technomancy.itch.io/bussard perhaps
2018-12-02 20:43:31	kensanata	Anyway, so now I'm writing story snippets for two Science Fiction projects and I love it.
2018-12-02 20:45:29	alexis	Hmm. I think I remember khuxkm saying that cosmicbot runs on cosmic.voyage. Can anyone corroborate?
2018-12-02 20:45:43	alexis	If so, I only need to worry about python3, it looks like.
2018-12-02 20:46:09	jan6	y'know there's an easy solution
2018-12-02 20:46:14	alexis	Oh?
2018-12-02 20:46:14	jan6	just try it out
2018-12-02 20:46:19	alexis	I mean, I am.
2018-12-02 20:46:33	alexis	That question was prompted by finding that cosmic.voyage only has python3 installed.
2018-12-02 20:46:48	jan6	if it errors with anything else than missing files then it's wrong python, ez
2018-12-02 20:47:12	jan6	but yeah, probably 3, I remember it too being run on the voyage
2018-12-02 20:49:15	jan6	⁠

2018-12-02 22:45:38	hyperboredoubt	How do I get the ssh public key again?
2018-12-02 22:45:47	jan6	uhh, cosmicbot? you alright?
2018-12-02 22:45:59	~tomasino	oh, kensanata wrote a whole guide
2018-12-02 22:46:05	~tomasino	let me find it
2018-12-02 22:46:18	jan6	many guides exist

2018-12-02 22:46:56	~tomasino	https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2018-11-28_Cosmic_Voyage
2018-12-02 22:47:01	ben	gpg --export-ssh-key <keyname>
2018-12-02 22:47:12	jan6	wat dat, ben ?
2018-12-02 22:47:18	jan6	ssh-kegen
2018-12-02 22:47:22	jan6	ssh-keygen
2018-12-02 22:47:27	ben	no, gpg-agent provides my ssh key
2018-12-02 22:47:34	~tomasino	brb... house stuff
2018-12-02 22:47:34	jan6	sure, yours
2018-12-02 22:47:47	ben	so if anyone grabs my gpg pubkey, they can do gpg --export-ssh-key
2018-12-02 22:48:07	ben	https://github.com/lrvick/security-token-docs/blob/master/Use_Cases/SSH.md#gpg
2018-12-02 22:49:06	jan6	also that'd mean you use the same key eveywhere? or no?
2018-12-02 22:49:18	alexis	Not sure if you've seen already, tomasino, but it looks like something went goofy with Persephone Prime's first update.
2018-12-02 22:49:44	ben	yeah, i have a handful of other ones too though
2018-12-02 22:50:47	hyperboredoubt	Should I just use the same key as I use for all my tilde stuff?
2018-12-02 22:53:39	~tomasino	that's an easy way
2018-12-02 22:54:22	~tomasino	doh, i must have broken something
2018-12-02 22:54:59	~tomasino	hrm, listing in gopher seems good
2018-12-02 22:55:33	~tomasino	okay, just a problem on cosmic-web
2018-12-02 22:57:07	alexis	The Gopher listing was temporarily broken. There were four entries, all of which showed 'File or directory not found!'
2018-12-02 22:57:22	alexis	It looks OK now, but I saw it look otherwise before, when I mentioned something was up.
2018-12-02 22:57:24	~tomasino	ok, so the problem is in log

2018-12-02 22:59:50	alexis	OK, whoever is doing Persephone Prime, I kinda love you right now, by the way. Using the magic header from SAME at the front of your message? Delightful. ❤
2018-12-02 23:01:18	alexis	Well, SAME or NAVTEX, I suppose. I don't know which you got them from, but either way, I'm a fan.

2018-12-02 23:03:11	~tomasino	very cool header style
2018-12-02 23:14:10	hyperboredoubt	Tomasino, how does "Hive-ship Murmurden" sound for the ship?
2018-12-02 23:15:08	~tomasino	Myrmidon?
2018-12-02 23:15:17	~tomasino	like achilles crew?
2018-12-02 23:16:33	hyperboredoubt	It is a multi-pun like James Joyce would do. Myrmidon+murmur+den+murder
2018-12-02 23:16:41	~tomasino	cool
2018-12-02 23:17:23	hyperboredoubt	I thought of just calling it "Murmurder" but that felt too much like Warhammer 40,000.
2018-12-02 23:18:16	~tomasino	i love people's inspirations
2018-12-02 23:18:57	khuxkm|lounge	alexis: hi, the ping of the user requesting the roster is intentional, remove the unhighlight bit from it and I'll merge! thanks!
2018-12-02 23:19:02	hyperboredoubt	Or maybe..." Whisperwill"? What do you think?
2018-12-02 23:19:21	khuxkm|lounge	hmmst
2018-12-02 23:19:37	hyperboredoubt	Hi, khuxkm|lounge
2018-12-02 23:20:20	alexis	khuxkm|lounge: Awesome, will do! Soon as I get done fetching back my clean laundry for tomorrow - give me half an hour or so.
2018-12-02 23:21:08	alexis	Oh, do you prefer squash commits on master, or that I just drop a second commit for the feedback?
2018-12-02 23:21:19	khuxkm|lounge	just drop a second commit
2018-12-02 23:21:23	alexis	OK cool, will do.
2018-12-02 23:24:40	hyperboredoubt	Maybe a pun for the ship's name is inappropriate... It seems too silly and also language would have shifted by then.
2018-12-02 23:25:33	alexis	Would it? There's an argument to be made that the proliferation of writing, especially via modern networks, would tend to freeze language to a much greater extent than in the past.
2018-12-02 23:25:40	alexis	(OK, AFK for real this time...)
2018-12-02 23:31:51	alexis	(Mostly. In general, the point of a ship name I think is that it’s one you like and isn’t, for example, gratuitously offensive. I haven’t seen the setting, or anyone writing in it, attempt to assert a specific rule about propriety for something like that. I would be surprised if anyone did.)
2018-12-02 23:32:55	hyperboredoubt	How about "Den-ship Murmurs"?
2018-12-02 23:34:11	hyperboredoubt	I guess I could just call it the "Murmur Den".
2018-12-02 23:34:19	~tomasino	 nice
2018-12-02 23:34:27	hyperboredoubt	Does that work, tomasino?
2018-12-02 23:34:34	~tomasino	sure!
2018-12-02 23:34:48	~tomasino	first step is making you the account, though. need the ssh pubkey
2018-12-02 23:35:28	hyperboredoubt	Can I re-use one I already have?
2018-12-02 23:35:31	ben	yup
2018-12-02 23:35:46	hyperboredoubt	How do I send it to you?
2018-12-02 23:36:03	~tomasino	copy & paste, use the tilde.team pastboard (pb), or email or whatever
2018-12-02 23:36:13	~tomasino	you can /msg me with it if you want
2018-12-02 23:37:31	hyperboredoubt	Hmmm, I think I found my "private key" but I don't know where my public key is.
2018-12-02 23:38:44	~tomasino	should be in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
2018-12-02 23:38:49	~tomasino	unless you specifically moved it
2018-12-03 00:16:51	hyperboredoubt	What should I do next, tomasino ?
2018-12-03 00:17:06	~tomasino	read your mail
2018-12-03 00:17:09	~tomasino	'alpine'
2018-12-03 00:18:28	ben	how about mutt
2018-12-03 00:21:26	~tomasino	yep, but if hyper isn't familiar with ssh things, i figure alpine is easier
2018-12-03 00:22:23	ben	ah ok that's fari
2018-12-03 00:24:04	hyperboredoubt	True, lol.
2018-12-03 00:24:09	hyperboredoubt	I'm reading the mail now.
2018-12-03 00:30:17	hyperboredoubt	This whole writing this is going to be difficult! The existing character posts are so well done.
2018-12-03 00:30:30	~tomasino	:D
2018-12-03 00:31:01	~tomasino	whatever you write will post as-is, so please make sure to wrap your text somewhere less than 80 chars wide. I do the happy gopher 67, but some do 80.
2018-12-03 00:31:15	~tomasino	if you're not a shell person, nano is probably your best bet
2018-12-03 00:35:50	hyperboredoubt	I'll try that in a bit.

2018-12-03 01:06:25	~tomasino	:(
2018-12-03 01:06:45	alexis	Weird. I mean, they're there, but they're Unicode zero-width spaces and should not visibly render in most fontsets.
2018-12-03 01:07:02	~tomasino	i have good unicode support otherwise
2018-12-03 01:07:06	alexis	Let me double-check - it could be that the bots I've seen that do this use some other zero-width character, and I just assumed it was a ZWS.
2018-12-03 01:10:09	alexis	...no, so far at least they all seem to be using #x200b, just like I did. I'm asking around to see what I can find out.
2018-12-03 01:10:23	alexis	In the meantime, does this render visibly in weechat, tomasino? [‍]
2018-12-03 01:10:57	~tomasino	i see a space
2018-12-03 01:11:01	~tomasino	wait

2018-12-03 01:11:05	~tomasino	yes
2018-12-03 01:11:07	~tomasino	a space
2018-12-03 01:11:16	alexis	Huh. That's a zero-width joiner.
2018-12-03 01:11:31	~tomasino	i'm on a system, moshed to another system, running tmux, and weechat
2018-12-03 01:11:35	~tomasino	it could be any number of things
2018-12-03 01:11:37	alexis	True.
2018-12-03 01:12:24	hyperboredoubt	Okay, I've written out my post.
2018-12-03 01:12:44	hyperboredoubt	How do I submit it?
2018-12-03 01:15:31	alexis	Oh ew, I wish I'd used a non-breaking space instead. It breaks within the nicks on my phone. x.x
2018-12-03 01:15:41	alexis	Oh well, I'll throw that in when I drop that PR for !latest.
2018-12-03 01:16:16	alexis	hyperboredoubt: Are you able to ssh into cosmic.voyage?
2018-12-03 01:16:54	hyperboredoubt	I think so, yes.
2018-12-03 01:17:28	alexis	OK. Do so, and I'll walk you through the process of publishing your update.
2018-12-03 01:17:39	alexis	(If you're not able to do so, let me know how it goes wrong, and we'll fix that first.)
2018-12-03 01:17:49	hyperboredoubt	I think I am at the command line.
2018-12-03 01:18:04	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$
2018-12-03 01:18:11	hyperboredoubt	Is that where I should be?
2018-12-03 01:18:17	alexis	Yup! You're good to go.
2018-12-03 01:18:25	hyperboredoubt	YEY.
2018-12-03 01:18:37	hyperboredoubt	But what commands do I input, lol?
2018-12-03 01:18:46	alexis	So this way this works is, you've got a directory called `ships` in your home directory (where you are right now, represented by ~ in the prompt), and inside `ships` there'll be another directory with the name of your ship.
2018-12-03 01:18:52	alexis	Are you familiar with navigation at the command line?
2018-12-03 01:19:01	alexis	If not, I can give you a quick rundown.
2018-12-03 01:19:11	hyperboredoubt	Only very slightly. Yes, I'd like that.
2018-12-03 01:20:12	alexis	OK. So you're always in one directory on the file system. That's called your "current directory", and when you first log in, you start out in your "home directory" - it's called that because it's your home on this system, where you can keep all your stuff. In a lot of places, the shorthand '~' (a single tilde) is used to represent your home directory.
2018-12-03 01:20:25	alexis	You can always tell exactly where you are with the command `pwd` (Print Working Directory). Try that now.
2018-12-03 01:20:44	alexis	(
2018-12-03 01:21:00	alexis	"Working directory" is another name for your current directory. They mean the same thing; sometimes you see one used, sometimes the other.)
2018-12-03 01:21:02	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ pwd
2018-12-03 01:21:04	hyperboredoubt	/home/aureolin
2018-12-03 01:22:28	alexis	Awesome! That's the full name of your home directory, by the way. You've noticed the '/' (slash) characters in it - those separate the names of different directories, and the whole thing is known as a "path". Directories closer to the end of a path are inside the ones closer to the start; in this case, "aureolin" is inside "home". That doesn't matter too much right now, but it's useful to know in general.
2018-12-03 01:22:55	hyperboredoubt	Thanks. :)
2018-12-03 01:22:59	alexis	The next thing to know is how to see what's in a directory. That's done with the `ls` command (LiSt, and don't ask me why it's like that, please!). Try that now.
2018-12-03 01:23:19	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls
2018-12-03 01:23:20	hyperboredoubt	mail  ships
2018-12-03 01:23:52	~tomasino	cosmic-web is now designed to better match gopherspace
2018-12-03 01:23:54	~tomasino	huzzah
2018-12-03 01:24:11	hyperboredoubt	That seems like a good plan.
2018-12-03 01:24:22	alexis	OK! So I mentioned a minute ago that there's a 'ships' directory, and a directory inside that for each ship that you have. Let's take a look at what's in there - we also do that with the `ls` command, by telling it the name of the thing we're interested in knowing more about. In this case, it'd be `ls ships`. Try that now.
2018-12-03 01:24:47	alexis	(Telling it the path of the thing, I should've said. Sorry! I')
2018-12-03 01:24:53	alexis	ll be more careful about what I call things.)
2018-12-03 01:25:17	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls ships
2018-12-03 01:25:19	hyperboredoubt	'Murmur Den'
2018-12-03 01:26:02	hyperboredoubt	Then type 'ls Murmur Den', yes?
2018-12-03 01:26:03	alexis	OK! So that tells you that, inside 'ships', there's another directory called 'Murmur Den'. (Actually it just tells you there's something in there with that name, but we know it's a directory, so we'll go with that for now.)
2018-12-03 01:26:20	alexis	Not exactly. There are a couple more things to know.
2018-12-03 01:26:34	hyperboredoubt	Lead the way.
2018-12-03 01:27:36	alexis	First, when giving a path to `ls`, it has to be one of two kinds of path: either an absolute path, which isn't important right now, or a relative path - "relative" here meaning from your working directory. Since 'Murmur Den' is inside 'ships', the path to 'Murmur Den' from your working directory has two components, not just one.
2018-12-03 01:28:46	alexis	Second, spaces in directory and file names are a little weird. Command line programs treat spaces as separators between different parts of the command, so you have to do something special to let them know that this space is part of a name. That's called "escaping", and it's done with a backslash before the space that's being escaped, like so: 'Murmur\ Den'.
2018-12-03 01:29:16	alexis	See if you can get 'ls' to tell you what's inside Murmur Den right now.
2018-12-03 01:30:26	alexis	(It's okay if you can't! No one is handing out grades here.)
2018-12-03 01:30:39	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls Murmur\ Den
2018-12-03 01:30:41	hyperboredoubt	ls: cannot access 'Murmur Den': No such file or directory
2018-12-03 01:30:43	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls Murmur\Den
2018-12-03 01:30:45	hyperboredoubt	ls: cannot access 'MurmurDen': No such file or directory
2018-12-03 01:30:52	~tomasino	close!
2018-12-03 01:30:59	alexis	Close indeed! Remember, Murmur Den is inside ships, and ships is inside your working directory.
2018-12-03 01:31:52	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls ships Murmur\ Den
2018-12-03 01:31:54	hyperboredoubt	ls: cannot access 'Murmur Den': No such file or directory
2018-12-03 01:31:56	hyperboredoubt	ships:
2018-12-03 01:31:58	hyperboredoubt	'Murmur Den'
2018-12-03 01:32:39	alexis	Closer still! `ls` thinks you want to know about two things: 'ships' (which it can find from where you are), and 'Murmur Den' (which it can't). Remember that '/' is used between parts of a path, and that parts of a path nearer the end are inside parts nearer the start.
2018-12-03 01:34:53	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls/ships/Murmur\Den
2018-12-03 01:34:55	hyperboredoubt	-bash: ls/ships/MurmurDen: No such file or directory
2018-12-03 01:34:57	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls ships/Murmur\Den
2018-12-03 01:34:59	hyperboredoubt	ls: cannot access 'ships/MurmurDen': No such file or directory
2018-12-03 01:35:01	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ ls ships/Murmur\ Den
2018-12-03 01:35:03	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$
2018-12-03 01:35:10	alexis	Third time's the charm!
2018-12-03 01:35:33	~tomasino	perfecto!
2018-12-03 01:35:37	hyperboredoubt	Okay, now where am I and what do I do next.
2018-12-03 01:35:43	alexis	A lot of times, when a shell command works but doesn't have anything to report, it just doesn't say anything. That's what happened here: there's nothing in ships/Murmur\ Den, so it just doesn't tell you anything at all.
2018-12-03 01:35:44	hyperboredoubt	Thanks, alexis and tomasino.
2018-12-03 01:36:09	~tomasino	you can always see where you are by typing "pwd" (present working directory)
2018-12-03 01:36:15	~tomasino	in this case, you're still in the same spot
2018-12-03 01:36:18	alexis	So, the next thing to know is how to move from one directory to another - you can do things in directories other than where you are right now, but it's often easier to be where you want to do stuff.
2018-12-03 01:36:25	~tomasino	you'le just using 'ls' to look around relative to you
2018-12-03 01:36:57	alexis	For that, there's the command `cd` (Change Directory). It (and everything else) takes the same kind of path that `ls` does. Try it now.
2018-12-03 01:37:17	alexis	(It's also worth mentioning that if you just say `cd`, without giving it a path, it'll take you back to your home directory from wherever you happen to be.)
2018-12-03 01:37:41	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ cd
2018-12-03 01:37:43	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ pwd
2018-12-03 01:37:45	hyperboredoubt	/home/aureolin
2018-12-03 01:37:56	~tomasino	try moving into the ships directory
2018-12-03 01:38:15	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ cd ships
2018-12-03 01:38:17	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~/ships$
2018-12-03 01:38:23	~tomasino	bam!
2018-12-03 01:38:42	~tomasino	that prompt of yours is giving you some nice info as well
2018-12-03 01:38:42	alexis	Yup! And notice that the text before your cursor has changed, too. That's another way the system uses to help you know where you are.
2018-12-03 01:38:52	~tomasino	username@hostname at the beginning
2018-12-03 01:38:57	alexis	(The text before the cursor is also known as the "prompt".)
2018-12-03 01:39:01	~tomasino	:<current directory>
2018-12-03 01:39:07	alexis	Try moving into the 'Murmur Den' directory now.
2018-12-03 01:39:29	alexis	Remember that, when we deal with spaces in names, we have to escape them by putting a '\' before them, so the system understands we mean one name and not two.
2018-12-03 01:39:37	~tomasino	~ = shorthand for your home directory, or /home/aureolin. So your prompt is telling you you're at HOME/ships
2018-12-03 01:39:37	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~/ships$ cd Murmur\ Den
2018-12-03 01:39:39	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~/ships/Murmur Den$
2018-12-03 01:39:42	alexis	Awesome!
2018-12-03 01:39:46	~tomasino	bam! you're flying now
2018-12-03 01:39:52	alexis	I've taught people with doctorates who didn't catch on half this fast.
2018-12-03 01:40:03	hyperboredoubt	Space, space, wanna go to space.
2018-12-03 01:40:35	alexis	OK! Now you're where you need to be to post your update. In order to do that, you'll need to create a file with the text of your update in it, and that file's name has to end with '.txt' - the update script won't notice it, if it ends with anything else.
2018-12-03 01:40:44	alexis	There are lots and lots of ways to create files at the command line! But let's go with an easy one.
2018-12-03 01:40:54	alexis	What name do you want your update file to have?
2018-12-03 01:41:29	alexis	(Mostly we just use the number of the update it is, so something like '1' or '001' or similar. But there's no requirement! As long as it doesn't have a slash in it, it can be anything you want.)
2018-12-03 01:42:27	hyperboredoubt	Ours_ is_this_chimera
2018-12-03 01:42:50	hyperboredoubt	Ours_ is_this_chimera.txt
2018-12-03 01:42:54	alexis	(Is the space in there on purpose, or by accident? Works either way, I just want to be sure.)
2018-12-03 01:43:03	hyperboredoubt	Accident, lol.
2018-12-03 01:43:07	alexis	OK! No worries.
2018-12-03 01:43:30	hyperboredoubt	Ours_is_this_chimera.txt
2018-12-03 01:43:37	alexis	So, at the command line, type in `tee > Ours_is_this_chimera.txt` - without the `s. You'll notice that your prompt doesn't come back this time, the way it has with all the other commands you've done up to now. That's on purpose, too.
2018-12-03 01:44:12	~tomasino	oh alexis, going all fancy
2018-12-03 01:44:18	~tomasino	i was just gonna give the guy nano
2018-12-03 01:44:20	~tomasino	haha
2018-12-03 01:45:16	hyperboredoubt	tee > Ours_is_this_chimera.txt?
2018-12-03 01:45:21	alexis	Yup.
2018-12-03 01:45:53	alexis	So once you run that command, anything you type into the command line will go into a new file with the name you gave after the '>'. More to the point: anything you paste will go there, as well! So you can write your updates in whatever program you like best, and just paste them into the command line to copy them over to the server.
2018-12-03 01:46:13	hyperboredoubt	ureolin@cosmic:~/ships/Murmur Den$ tee > Ours_is_this_chimera.txt
2018-12-03 01:46:15	hyperboredoubt	^C
2018-12-03 01:46:17	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~/ships/Murmur Den$
2018-12-03 01:47:13	alexis	OK. That '^C' means You typed Control-C, which exited the command you were running. That works almost all the time, no matter what program is running when you do it; about the only thing it won't do is exit from the command line itself.
2018-12-03 01:48:04	hyperboredoubt	So, retype tee > Ours_is_this_chimera.txt ?
2018-12-03 01:48:05	alexis	That's actually how you'll exit from the `tee` command itself, once you're done pasting your update across! Well done - but we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.
2018-12-03 01:48:10	alexis	And, yes.
2018-12-03 01:48:42	hyperboredoubt	Okay, I think it is ready.
2018-12-03 01:48:56	alexis	It's ready if your prompt hasn't come back, yup.
2018-12-03 01:49:59	alexis	So, you can copy your update from whatever program it's written in, and then paste it in. How you do that depends on the program you're using for a command line, but most such programs should have an Edit menu with a Paste option in it.
2018-12-03 01:50:23	alexis	You'll know you got it right once you see your update appear in the window.
2018-12-03 01:50:29	-->	snurryboy (fatr@169.129.129.203.sta.dodo.net.au) has joined #cosmic
2018-12-03 01:51:00	alexis	If you're having trouble finding out how to paste it, we'll figure out what program you're using, and from there we can find the instructions we need. (There are a lot of these programs, so it might take a little while, but never fear! We'll figure it out.)
2018-12-03 01:51:26	alexis	If you're not having trouble finding out, then once it's pasted, you can exit `tee` again with another Control-C.
2018-12-03 01:51:35	alexis	Let me know when you're ready to continue, or if something goes wrong.
2018-12-03 01:52:47	hyperboredoubt	I see a black screen with my post written.
2018-12-03 01:53:07	hyperboredoubt	Will it preserve the formatting?
2018-12-03 01:53:36	alexis	It depends. Are your lines hard wrapped, with a Return at the end of each line, or are they soft wrapped, and about as wide as the window you pasted them in?
2018-12-03 01:54:10	hyperboredoubt	The latter.
2018-12-03 01:54:21	alexis	(Another way to find out: If you resize the window where you wrote your update, do the lines change length to fit the new size?)
2018-12-03 01:54:51	alexis	Ah! OK, then. In that case, the formatting you see won't be preserved. You'll want to hard wrap the lines before publishing the update; if you don't have a good way to do that on your computer, https://www.browserling.com/tools/word-wrap works very well.
2018-12-03 01:55:04	alexis	It's best to wrap them to about 67 characters long, so they'll display well in Gopher and browsers both.
2018-12-03 01:56:19	alexis	Once you've got them wrapped, let me know.
2018-12-03 01:57:07	hyperboredoubt	I put it in the tool on that link, but it seemed like nothing changed.
2018-12-03 01:57:17	alexis	Hmm. One sec...
2018-12-03 01:57:47	hyperboredoubt	I wrote it in a fairly narrow, poem-like way, so maybe that had something to do with it.
2018-12-03 01:58:05	alexis	Ah! Yeah, that's why - all your lines are short enough so they don't hit the point where we'd want to wrap them. So you're good to go as-is.
2018-12-03 01:58:33	hyperboredoubt	Will it preserve the spacing?
2018-12-03 01:58:37	alexis	It will.
2018-12-03 01:58:41	hyperboredoubt	Yay. :)
2018-12-03 01:58:52	alexis	So you're good to go! If you're still in the `tee` command, you can exit it with Control-C, and you'll get your prompt back. There's no need to save; everything goes straight into the file as soon as it's typed or pasted.
2018-12-03 01:59:06	alexis	Just one more thing to do, and that's actually publish the update!
2018-12-03 01:59:30	alexis	You can do that with the `log` command. It doesn't need a path or anything - when you run it, it finds any updates in your ship that aren't already published, and asks if you want to publish them.
2018-12-03 01:59:45	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~/ships/Murmur Den$
2018-12-03 01:59:58	alexis	OK! Now you can say `log` to start publishing.
2018-12-03 02:00:10	~tomasino	this is the exciting part!
2018-12-03 02:00:35	alexis	So, `log` will ask you if you want to publish the update. When you say 'yes', it'll ask you what name you want them to have. That's what appears in the lists of log entries on the website and the gopher hole, and also what's shown by cosmicbot here when it sees a new entry published.
2018-12-03 02:00:55	alexis	(tomasino: log runs cosmic-web now, right?)
2018-12-03 02:01:32	~tomasino	yep

2018-12-03 02:03:59	hyperboredoubt	Did it work?

2018-12-03 02:04:09	hyperboredoubt	Dammit.
2018-12-03 02:04:18	alexis	No worries! tomasino will be happy to fix that for you right now.
2018-12-03 02:04:18	~tomasino	what title did you want to give it?
2018-12-03 02:04:38	hyperboredoubt	Ours_is_this_chimera
2018-12-03 02:05:13	~tomasino	your title doesn't need underscores, unless that's part of the style you want for your titles
2018-12-03 02:05:19	hyperboredoubt	How do I not name it "yes" next time?
2018-12-03 02:05:21	~tomasino	i updated it, you can see it on gopher and web
2018-12-03 02:05:35	cosmicbot	Transmission received: Murmur Den - Ours is this chimera (https://cosmic.voyage/Murmur%20Den/Ours_is_this_chimera.html)

2018-12-03 02:05:55	hyperboredoubt	Thanks for the information, lol.
2018-12-03 02:06:01	~tomasino	the next line asks for the title, then you type it out and hit enter
2018-12-03 02:06:04	alexis	Oh dang, sorry! I forgot it didn't take an Enter keypress after the "do you want to publish" question. That one's on me!
2018-12-03 02:06:20	~tomasino	i'm gonna put a check in log to abort on empty title
2018-12-03 02:06:26	~tomasino	that'll help
2018-12-03 02:06:57	alexis	Anyway, that's basically how it works. There's a lot more to the command line than this, of course! If you're interested, a good place to start is http://linuxcommand.org/index.php, which gives more detail on the same topics we've talked about tonight, and covers a great deal more besides.
2018-12-03 02:07:15	hyperboredoubt	Oh, no. My signature isn't at the end of the post.
2018-12-03 02:08:02	~tomasino	you can edit your file and change it. you don't need to run log again
2018-12-03 02:08:13	~tomasino	for editing your text file, i'd recommend "nano"
2018-12-03 02:08:17	alexis	That's okay! You can change a published post at any time, by modifying the file it's in. One way to do that is with `nano`, the text editor tomasino mentioned earlier. Or, if you rather, you can just change it to your liking in the program you used to write it, and then do that `tee > Ours_is_the_chimera.txt` and paste the whole thing in again - if you do that, it'll replace what's already there.
2018-12-03 02:08:22	~tomasino	just say "nano filename.txt"
2018-12-03 02:08:34	~tomasino	there ya go
2018-12-03 02:08:36	~tomasino	either one
2018-12-03 02:08:50	alexis	(If you'd like a recommendation, I'd go with the paste-it-again method. Nano works, but it's a bit of a bear to use if you're not accustomed to its rather old-fashioned interaction style. I don't use nano myself, except when I absolutely have to!)
2018-12-03 02:09:10	hyperboredoubt	Maybe my signature had an escape key in it.
2018-12-03 02:09:38	hyperboredoubt	I put "|| ego-skeleton aureolin" at the end.
2018-12-03 02:09:40	alexis	The Escape key doesn't actually have special meaning in that `tee` command. It won't exit you out or anything. A control-C in the file would, but that's very hard to do by accident.
2018-12-03 02:10:30	alexis	Yeah, nothing there would make `tee` exit...I wonder if the copy just missed out the last line? Anyway, no worries! You can just `tee > Ours_is_the_chimera.txt` again and paste the whole thing in - it'll replace what's already there, so the update won't change except that the last line will be added.
2018-12-03 02:11:57	~tomasino	editing a post you've already made will update on gopher immediately, but will take up to 15 minutes to show up on the web and in RSS. Just FYI
2018-12-03 02:12:25	alexis	(If you want it to show up sooner on the web after it's edited, you can run the command `cosmic-web` to publish the update there immediately.)
2018-12-03 02:12:27	hyperboredoubt	Ah, that's good to know.
2018-12-03 02:12:59	hyperboredoubt	Okay, I've copied and pasted again. What do I do next?
2018-12-03 02:13:35	alexis	Hit Control-C again, to exit `tee` and get your prompt back.
2018-12-03 02:14:06	hyperboredoubt	Then "log"?
2018-12-03 02:14:15	hyperboredoubt	Or "cosmic-web"?
2018-12-03 02:14:19	alexis	The latter.
2018-12-03 02:14:49	hyperboredoubt	What next?
2018-12-03 02:15:13	alexis	Nothing! Once you've run `cosmic-web`, you're all set - the corrected update is published everywhere.
2018-12-03 02:15:22	~tomasino	cosmic-web runs every 15 minutes on the system, in case you ever forget
2018-12-03 02:15:57	hyperboredoubt	Check my post. I don't think I did it right.
2018-12-03 02:16:15	alexis	Mm. Fair; I also don't see the signature you mentioned.
2018-12-03 02:16:35	alexis	Did it show up when you pasted the corrected update into the command line window?
2018-12-03 02:16:51	hyperboredoubt	Did what show up?
2018-12-03 02:17:08	alexis	Sorry - the signature you mentioned wanting to add.
2018-12-03 02:17:19	hyperboredoubt	It seemed to.
2018-12-03 02:17:25	alexis	Oh! I know what's wrong.
2018-12-03 02:17:28	~tomasino	I don't see a sig
2018-12-03 02:17:36	alexis	What's wrong is, you're trying to learn this from a goofball who left out a step - I'm sorry about that!
2018-12-03 02:17:47	hyperboredoubt	What happened, lol?
2018-12-03 02:18:06	alexis	So when you hit Control-C in `tee`, it'll keep all the lines you've pasted in that end with a Return. If the last line doesn't end with a Return, that line gets left out. (I can explain why, but it's not super important right now - ask later if you want to know more.)
2018-12-03 02:18:51	alexis	So, to fix it, run that `tee > Ours_is_the_chimera.txt` command one more time, and paste the update in again - but this time, before you hit Control-C, hit Return first. You want the cursor to be at the left side of the window, on a new line below the last line of your update.
2018-12-03 02:18:54	alexis	Does that make sense?
2018-12-03 02:20:48	hyperboredoubt	I think so...
2018-12-03 02:21:39	hyperboredoubt	I am back at "aureolin@cosmic:~$".
2018-12-03 02:22:12	alexis	Hmm. It looks like the signature still isn't there.
2018-12-03 02:22:36	hyperboredoubt	Is there another way besides ^C?
2018-12-03 02:23:23	hyperboredoubt	Can you add the signature for me?
2018-12-03 02:23:26	alexis	There is; Control-D also exits that `tee` command, in a slightly different way. I usually use Control-C and it works OK, but it's definitely worth trying Control-D instead; cosmic.voyage might work a little differently than the systems with which I'm more familiar, or I might've been screwing it up fror a long time without realizing.
2018-12-03 02:24:27	alexis	I can add the signature for you, but I need permission to edit your file in order to do that. To give me that permission, you'd run these two commands: `chgrp alexis Ours_is_the_chimera.txt` and `chmod 664 Ours_is_the_chimera.txt`.
2018-12-03 02:24:33	~tomasino	ctrl-c "quits", ctrl-d "completes", as a rule
2018-12-03 02:24:52	alexis	(I'll show you how to take that permission away from me again, once I've made the change you've asked me to.)
2018-12-03 02:26:05	hyperboredoubt	aureolin@cosmic:~$ chgrp alexis Ours_is_the_chimera.txt

2018-12-03 02:26:54	~tomasino	it's most certainly there. :)

2018-12-03 02:28:52	~tomasino	one sec
2018-12-03 02:29:02	~tomasino	there you go
2018-12-03 02:29:21	hyperboredoubt	Thank you muchly.
2018-12-03 02:29:31	hyperboredoubt	And thank you for helping me through this.
2018-12-03 02:29:53	hyperboredoubt	I'm basically at grandma-level computer literacy.
2018-12-03 02:29:54	alexis	Gladly! I'm happy to have been able to help.
2018-12-03 02:30:13	alexis	And don't sweat it! I wasn't kidding when I said I've taught this stuff to people with advanced degrees, and who didn't catch on half so fast.
2018-12-03 02:30:38	hyperboredoubt	What did you think of the post?
2018-12-03 02:30:43	alexis	It really isn't simple, so I wouldn't worry about it if it seems complicated to you. It's complicated to everyone; some of us just have a lot more experience of it.
2018-12-03 02:30:52	hyperboredoubt	What is your interpretation?
2018-12-03 02:31:10	alexis	And, being honest, I haven't yet really given it the consideration it is due. May I answer that question in a little while? I think I'll have something more worthwhile to say then than I have now.
2018-12-03 02:31:23	hyperboredoubt	I'm going to share it on Reddit.com/r/FifthWorldPoetry.
2018-12-03 02:32:14	~tomasino	oh nice
2018-12-03 02:32:27	~tomasino	i like it! it's such a different style. It's going to be a great addition
2018-12-03 02:40:35	hyperboredoubt	I tend to do all my stuff in a pseudo-poetic style.
2018-12-03 02:40:47	alexis	'Pseudo-'?
2018-12-03 02:40:59	alexis	Blank verse still counts 100%.
2018-12-03 02:41:23	hyperboredoubt	Yeah, but it is Tumblr-level poetry, lol.
2018-12-03 02:41:43	alexis	So?
2018-12-03 02:42:13	alexis	I mean, I'm not even sure what that means, but leaving that aside, the question still stands.
2018-12-03 02:43:13	alexis	And having now read it properly, if 'Tumblr-level' is as pejorative as it sounds, I don't think that it applies.
2018-12-03 02:43:18	hyperboredoubt	Basically, putting prose into a poem format doesn't make it a poem. It is a cheap trick used by hacks. (Of which I am one, lol.)
2018-12-03 02:44:44	alexis	I mean, I won't pretend to understand all that is going on in this message, but from what I am confident I'm able to grasp of what it's saying, I'm looking forward to finding out how your next update further develops the character - or other characters, or the setting you're using, or whatever you decide it should.
2018-12-03 02:45:21	alexis	(And it's okay that I not understand all of it! It need not be meant to be understood all at once, or indeed understood in its entirety ever.)
2018-12-03 02:45:44	alexis	As for the form, I suppose the question I'd ask is: if that's the form you felt best fit the content, why discount it?
2018-12-03 02:54:17	alexis	hyperboredoubt: Are you at all familiar with the tengwar of Fëanor?
2018-12-03 02:54:32	hyperboredoubt	A lot of my stuff is disjointed and loosely associated. My characters tedn to be non-human or humans with mental issues.
2018-12-03 02:54:45	hyperboredoubt	I've heard of them, alexis.
2018-12-03 02:55:47	alexis	Fair. I've found them enjoyable, although not recently - I'm just starting to pick up calligraphy again, and my hand has decayed quite badly. I was hoping to ask if you knew any good current resources, since all my old notes are lost.
2018-12-03 02:57:41	alexis	And to return briefly to the point of form and suchlike: I'm not a huge fan of Reddit, because I find there's too often a culture there of casual contempt. People are mean there more often than I like. Cosmic Voyage isn't that sort of place. There is no one here to whom you need apologize for what you choose to write in your updates, or how you choose to write it.
2018-12-03 02:57:59	alexis	Feel free to do with that information as you please, of course, but I thought it might bear mentioning.
2018-12-03 03:05:54	hyperboredoubt	The only source for Tengwar that I know is /r/Tengwar on Reddit.
2018-12-03 03:06:41	hyperboredoubt	Ah, I tend to hang out on tiny subreddits, so they are all very friendly.
2018-12-03 03:14:39	~tomasino	 i have a book on tengwar
2018-12-03 03:17:39	~tomasino	technically, i have a book on the languages of middle earth
2018-12-03 03:17:46	~tomasino	that's the title in fact

2018-12-03 03:18:13	~tomasino	anything you need to know specifically? i have it right here
2018-12-03 03:19:14	alexis	Not offhand, but I'll keep it in mind in case I run up against a question for which I can't dig up an answer. Thanks!
2018-12-03 03:27:11	hyperboredoubt	I think I have (most?) of my next post ready. I'll try to put it up later this week.

2018-12-03 18:32:47	alexis	To a considerable extent, they’re all separate stories - disjoint and time and space, and connected with one another only via the tenuous thread of QEC messaging.
2018-12-03 18:33:10	alexis	Much of the joy, at least for me, lies in discovering how these disjoint stories cease to be so.
2018-12-03 18:33:23	alexis	Disjoint in*
2018-12-03 18:48:28	jan6	I'd say "stories that interact with each other" rather than "disjoint stories"
2018-12-03 19:08:18	alexis	I wouldn’t argue.

2018-12-03 20:38:55	timotheus	i've been messing with an older pi i have for some local hosting. http://eee.citracode.com hits the little pi right next to me!
2018-12-03 20:39:54	ben	afaik cosmic.voyage is on the smallest vultr box
2018-12-03 20:40:09	ben	but most of tomasino's stuff runs on a pi
2018-12-03 20:40:15	ben	gopher.black
2018-12-03 20:50:14	alexis	It is a zero-width space, btw. I don’t love that because it allows for soft line wrapping, which breaks usernames over lines; I’m planning to sidecar a change to a zero-width nonbreaking space in an upcoming PR to add a !latest command. 
2018-12-03 20:51:06	alexis	I don’t know if that will improve rendering for those with fontset trouble, though - sorry, not much I can do about that without knowing the root cause, and likely not even then.
2018-12-03 20:57:41	~tomasino	its no been important enough to me to investigate yet. ;)
2018-12-03 20:58:21	alexis	Fair!
2018-12-03 20:58:26	~tomasino	gopher.black will go offline tonight for a day or two while I move

2018-12-03 21:08:44	kensanata	tomasino: One thing I noticed about the log command: if you have n files lying around, and you answer y to publish the first one, and n-1 times you answer n to publish the others, then you will be asked another n-1 times for the ones you didn't publish.
2018-12-03 21:09:10	kensanata	Perhaps because I have a file foo.txt~ for ever foo.txt? Emacs backup files...
2018-12-03 21:09:58	~tomasino	hrm... something for debugging!

2018-12-03 22:58:54	cognifice	Hi, again.
2018-12-03 23:52:03	alexis	So, the idea I mentioned earlier about anon.penet.fi - a little backstory helps, both about the nature of the original anon.penet.fi (Wikipedia will do), and that of the one in Cosmic Voyage 'verse: https://cosmic.voyage/ships/anon.penet.fi/
2018-12-03 23:53:33	alexis	I badly need to put together a timeline for Voortrekker's story so far, so I don't begin to trip (more) over the order of events and the like. But I'll be done with that in a bit, I think! In the meantime, those curious might find much of interest in the backstory of a Finnish anonymous remailer, which some also-anonymous future cypherpunk has seen fit to revive.
2018-12-04 00:01:25	hyperboredoubt	I'll check it now.
2018-12-04 00:34:58	cognifice	Interesting.
2018-12-04 00:38:45	alexis	Yes. I wonder if anyone else might see a way in which it might aid their storytelling, as I have found it to do for mine - and expect to continue finding. My thought is, it'd be neat to have e.g. anon.penet.fi@cosmic.voyage, or some similar such address, able to receive messages which would then be republished as mine was.
2018-12-04 00:39:17	alexis	No headers or other metadata, and the conceit is that the service is hosted on a satellite in a wide solar orbit where it's next to impossible to find, or communicate with except via QEC or (if you don't mind waiting hours to transmit) radio.
2018-12-04 00:40:13	alexis	So, when a message is received, the satellite retransmits the message via its own, separate QEC sender. Given the property of QEC messages that they can't be destroyed, and can only be modified with access to the sender that created them, such retransmissions should be very durable as long as the satellite itself isn't compromised.
2018-12-04 00:40:30	cognifice	This is very.... high concept? Is that the correct term?
2018-12-04 00:40:52	alexis	Mm, I'm not sure. What do you use it to mean?
2018-12-04 00:42:25	cognifice	After checking Google, it seems that is the wrong term.
2018-12-04 00:44:29	alexis	What would be the right one?
2018-12-04 00:46:04	alexis	(I've just had new nibs arrive for both my daily pens; I'm going to step away and swap those in, and flush the old ones for storage. Back in a bit!)
2018-12-04 00:47:25	cognifice	Calligraphy?
2018-12-04 00:55:10	timotheus	I feel like a rube now for not having a daily pen

2018-12-04 01:09:39	~tomasino	pens are neat
2018-12-04 01:09:56	alexis	timotheus: I'm a huge nerd, so maybe it evens out. :)
2018-12-04 01:10:41	~tomasino	i've got a pilot fountain pen but i don't use it enough and i'm always cleaning it
2018-12-04 01:11:13	alexis	That's often an issue - very few of them seal well enough to keep ink wet for more than a couple of weeks unused.
2018-12-04 01:12:00	alexis	What do you think of the idea for anon.penet.fi? I'm happy to handle the reposting aspect of it, initially by hand and eventually via automation if it gets to a point where that's less effort. I'd just need a likely address to exist on cosmic.voyage.
2018-12-04 01:12:20	alexis	Of course, it would also depend on whether anyone else would actually want to use that.
2018-12-04 01:15:40	~tomasino	it's a neat idea
2018-12-04 01:15:56	~tomasino	email is tricksy
2018-12-04 01:16:15	~tomasino	on the one hand i don't want to risk spam blowing up our pretty story-land
2018-12-04 01:16:30	cognifice	I'm still not even sure what is being proposed.
2018-12-04 01:16:41	~tomasino	but if people would use it, we could create a user for anon.peneti.fi and do all that shenanigans
2018-12-04 01:17:07	~tomasino	cognifice: we create an email address for anon.peniti.fi@cosmic.voyage. When you email it, it gets posted to the story under that ship name
2018-12-04 01:17:16	~tomasino	anyone can use it without us knowing who it was
2018-12-04 01:17:22	~tomasino	so you could write that into your stories
2018-12-04 01:17:28	alexis	Yup. No identifying info like mail headers, just whatever you send in the message body.
2018-12-04 01:17:44	~tomasino	probably use subject line as entry title
2018-12-04 01:17:53	alexis	Yup.
2018-12-04 01:17:57	~tomasino	alexis, you know how to write a mail handler to do it?
2018-12-04 01:18:05	alexis	Yes, but to begin with I'd do it by hand.
2018-12-04 01:18:11	cognifice	I don't think I've used a header yet, unless you cound the "Planet 1130" at the top.
2018-12-04 01:18:11	alexis	Not least for the spam concern you mentioned.
2018-12-04 01:18:35	~tomasino	well, if you'd like I can create you a second account and copy your pubkey over with that username
2018-12-04 01:18:42	~tomasino	and i'll move ownership of the ship there
2018-12-04 01:18:54	alexis	That sounds like a plan.
2018-12-04 01:19:06	~tomasino	brb!
2018-12-04 01:19:09	alexis	Thanks!
2018-12-04 01:20:49	~tomasino	this one's a little trickier since it's a "bad name"
2018-12-04 01:20:51	~tomasino	;)
2018-12-04 01:21:15	alexis	Mm. I'm not married to specifically that name, if it's going to be an argument with the box.
2018-12-04 01:21:28	alexis	Assuming the argument seems to you more trouble than it's worth. Otherwise, don't let me interfere!

2018-12-04 01:26:21	~tomasino	hah
2018-12-04 01:26:34	~tomasino	maybe i'll blow this one away and name it something similar but easier
2018-12-04 01:26:34	alexis	Use the UID?
2018-12-04 01:26:42	alexis	Yeah, I feel like this is going to be a cursed name forever.
2018-12-04 01:26:55	alexis	I'd be good with 'anonpenetfi', if that suits.
2018-12-04 01:27:05	~tomasino	much easier!

2018-12-04 01:28:01	alexis	Ooh, I should've been more patient. fail2ban is not happy with me right now.
2018-12-04 01:28:14	~tomasino	uh-oh
2018-12-04 01:28:19	~tomasino	yeah, you're gonna have a sad 30 min
2018-12-04 01:28:35	~tomasino	gives me time to more your ship
2018-12-04 01:28:39	alexis	That works!
2018-12-04 01:29:11	alexis	And then when I can get back in, I can fix the date goof I made in the first update, back when I was still dealing with dates by hand. x.x
2018-12-04 01:30:27	alexis	And the date goof I also made in the most recent update, because I forgot how calendars work. x.x

2018-12-04 01:32:32	alexis	I'll finish setting that up, and update the ship's banner, once I can log in again.
2018-12-04 01:32:51	~tomasino	i forget how to manually clean someone out of fail2ban
2018-12-04 01:32:54	~tomasino	:(
2018-12-04 01:33:58	alexis	It'd be something like `iptables -D <fail2ban-chain> -p tcp -s <ip>`, I think.
2018-12-04 01:34:21	alexis	Using the IP I just PMed you, and the name of fail2ban's chain, which should be fairly obvious in the output of `iptables -nvL | grep Chain`.
2018-12-04 01:34:34	alexis	I mean, assuming my sysadmin knowledge isn't so far out of date that none of this applies any more.
2018-12-04 01:34:52	alexis	In any case, I wouldn't sweat it. I can deal with being locked out for half an hour, and iptables is a marvelous footgun.
2018-12-04 01:34:59	alexis	I appreciate the thought, though!
2018-12-04 01:35:58	~tomasino	apparently there's a new way with fail2ban directly but i need to figure out the jail name
2018-12-04 01:36:00	~tomasino	whatever that is
2018-12-04 01:36:05	~tomasino	i see you in the list!

2018-12-04 01:37:55	alexis	Niiice.
2018-12-04 01:38:05	 *	tomasino does the running man
2018-12-04 01:38:28	alexis	Clearly my sysadmin knowledge is a little stale. But that's okay! I didn't love that life well enough to stay there, anyhow.
2018-12-04 01:38:53	~tomasino	i got a taste of it in college and noped out quick
2018-12-04 01:41:13	~tomasino	i think my favorite part of this whole thing so far is the headers
2018-12-04 01:41:25	~tomasino	everyone's got such cool ones!
2018-12-04 01:43:15	cognifice	I should probably make (read: copy and paste) some ASCII art.
2018-12-04 01:43:48	alexis	Yeah! Maybe it's just because I'm such a huge protocol nerd, but I really feel like the differences between them help establish the setting. Same general concept, vastly different kinds of message metadata - it gives me a sense that much time has elapsed.
2018-12-04 01:45:02	alexis	Speaking of time elapsing, I desperately need to implement a date-to-sol converter. Doing it with a desk calculator is a pain.
2018-12-04 01:45:19	~tomasino	i thought you did that already?

2018-12-04 01:47:10	alexis	No, just a pair of functions to convert dates between Ross's and Earth's frames of reference. But Ross 128 b's sol is 67.88 hours long, due to the wildly implausible 9:2 spin-orbit resonance I've arbitrarily imposed on its tidally locked orbit with its star, and that's a real headache to keep straight.
2018-12-04 01:47:32	~tomasino	sounds like you need a script, for sure
2018-12-04 01:47:42	alexis	Yup. I'll have one in a little while.

2018-12-04 01:54:04	cognifice	I think I'd like my ship to contact the anarcho-communists or the space witches (Garnet ship).
2018-12-04 01:55:01	~tomasino	Starbloom Communal Distributive Projection?
2018-12-04 01:57:17	~tomasino	Starbloom was a side-note to my main ship so far, but i'm sure they'd happily engage with you
2018-12-04 01:57:41	cognifice	Haha, noice.

2018-12-04 02:13:38	cognifice	"?
2018-12-04 02:17:56	alexis	New, I think.
2018-12-04 02:18:19	alexis	I also think I'm going to drop the propagation delay in QEC messages. It doesn't make sense that that would be distance-dependent in the first place, and in the second, it is being a huge headache right now.
2018-12-04 02:20:00	cognifice	Are some of those posts private or maybe non-published?
2018-12-04 02:21:34	alexis	Very possibly.
2018-12-04 02:32:39	~tomasino	oh boy, what did i screw up on log now
2018-12-04 02:32:41	~tomasino	;)
2018-12-04 02:33:51	~tomasino	having it try to call cosmic-web is not working well
2018-12-04 02:33:59	~tomasino	that script wants to run as sudo and that in turn blows up log
2018-12-04 02:34:02	~tomasino	so i removed it
2018-12-04 02:34:11	~tomasino	we can still cosmic-web manually, or it'll happen every 15 min
2018-12-04 02:34:34	alexis	That seems reasonable to me.

2018-12-04 02:35:06	alexis	Same!
2018-12-04 02:35:46	cognifice	Dang. I only have 1 made post, 1 unposted one, and an extremely vague idea.
2018-12-04 02:35:58	~tomasino	haha!
2018-12-04 02:36:03	~tomasino	alexis, don't burn yourself out!
2018-12-04 02:36:09	alexis	Oooooh.
2018-12-04 02:36:13	alexis	Lots of good stuff there.
2018-12-04 02:36:31	cognifice	I'm so bad at science-fiction, especially hard science-fiction.
2018-12-04 02:36:39	~tomasino	so don't write sci-fi
2018-12-04 02:36:48	alexis	And hey, no worries! I burn out a lot slower when I'm doing stuff I like, and I like this game very much. Besides, I'm going to bed soon. :)
2018-12-04 02:36:48	~tomasino	put a love story on your ship

2018-12-04 02:37:22	alexis	There's no rules.
2018-12-04 02:37:26	~tomasino	well, 1 rule

2018-12-04 02:37:29	alexis	Except don't blow up Earth unless you want all your characters to have goatees.
2018-12-04 02:37:36	~tomasino	^^
2018-12-04 02:41:40	alexis	OK, make that 21 pages of notes. At this rate, I'll be in volume four of my diary before the year's out.

2018-12-04 02:43:15	alexis	Oh my, yes. Exceedingly so.
2018-12-04 02:43:52	alexis	Anyway, I know I said I was going to bed, but I'm going to put that off an hour, I think, and write a new update first. Or start one, at least. We'll see how it goes.
2018-12-04 02:45:08	~tomasino	:D!

2018-12-04 12:54:51	alexis	I am deliberately
2018-12-04 12:55:07	alexis	going to reduce my pace of updates for a little while, I think. 
2018-12-04 12:55:39	alexis	For one thing, tomasino wasn’t wrong to warn me about burnout. I’ve been paying a price in sleep these last few days, and it is catching up with me. 
2018-12-04 12:56:19	alexis	For another, I have written myself into a five-dimensional superhypercorner, and I need a little time to intuit my way back out of it. 
2018-12-04 12:58:00	alexis	A tessercorneract, maybe.
2018-12-04 13:09:22	~tomasino	;)
2018-12-04 13:20:51	~tomasino	you probably just need a montage
2018-12-04 13:20:56	~tomasino	or a musical number
2018-12-04 13:27:29	alexis	I suppose I could base64 an Ogg file. But that feels like it’d be against the spirit of the thing. And believe me, no one here wants to hear me sing. :D
2018-12-04 13:28:34	alexis	But being real, I’m good. I just need to be quiet a little while and let the back of my head, which is a much better writer than I am anyway, give me a hint about what to do next.
2018-12-04 14:01:16	~tomasino	noice
2018-12-04 14:09:47	jan6	base64 isn't, against the spirit imo, somebody already base64-ed a text message, for example

2018-12-04 14:27:38	~tomasino	do you want ships for the other 2 abbeys?
2018-12-04 14:27:50	~tomasino	in case you want to write messages between them?
2018-12-04 14:28:07	 *	kensanata waves
2018-12-04 14:28:51	papa	No, at least not for now. I think there will probably be several characters on the DG who will transmit. Other ships don't have QEC. 
2018-12-04 14:29:24	~tomasino	ahha
2018-12-04 14:29:27	~tomasino	cool beans!
2018-12-04 14:29:38	papa	They are Trappists, so they don't talk much. ;)
2018-12-04 14:29:45	kensanata	hah
2018-12-04 14:30:49	kensanata	That... provides an interesting twist for my settlement target!
2018-12-04 14:31:16	kensanata	(TRAPPIST-1d)
2018-12-04 14:32:36	papa	You're running Hoffnung? Interesting story so far. I was thinking of having DG heading for TRAPPIST-1, but decided it's too far and changed to Luyten's Star.
2018-12-04 14:32:42	~tomasino	hahaha
2018-12-04 14:33:22	kensanata	Maybe there's a way for the ship to continue after Luyten's Star?
2018-12-04 14:33:34	kensanata	Or a rescue mission in either direction.
2018-12-04 14:34:27	kensanata	Sadly, I can't really focus on the entire dimension of time and space. I am already challenged in keeping my own timeline straight.
2018-12-04 14:34:44	kensanata	Let alone relativistic timeline entanglements with unknown co-authors.
2018-12-04 14:35:15	papa	That's a logical plan. I think these sublight starships would have to be designed to last so long in space that there'd be no need to stop on one planet. I think they'll drop a colony and the starship will keep going to another star, then another, ...
2018-12-04 14:35:39	kensanata	Yay!
2018-12-04 14:35:52	kensanata	Unrelated: all the stories have turned out far more interesting than I would have expected when I joined. I love it.
2018-12-04 14:36:44	papa	It's a scenario that's so open-ended we can make of it what we want.
2018-12-04 14:37:33	kensanata	Well, currently the revolutionaries on the Hoffnung are planning to crash the ship. Clearly a very stupid and dangerous move.
2018-12-04 14:38:04	~tomasino	new user 'morsecodemedia' is trying a ship name with the č character
2018-12-04 14:38:08	~tomasino	lets see how well the scripts work
2018-12-04 14:38:27	papa	Even for a religious order, I think sabotage on a starship might be the only capital offense.
2018-12-04 14:38:44	kensanata	UTF-8 for the win! Let all those old gopher clients crumble and fall.
2018-12-04 14:38:57	papa	You did a good job with embedded spaces.
2018-12-04 14:39:39	papa	Weecht is leaving random characters here and there on my screen.
2018-12-04 14:39:41	~tomasino	haha
2018-12-04 14:40:18	papa	Maybe it's not blanking old lines before redrawing new text on top.
2018-12-04 14:40:31	papa	Sometimes.
2018-12-04 14:41:09	jan6	it's a problem with your term, usually happens with emoji and stuff, you can ctrl-l to reset, or explore the options
2018-12-04 14:41:43	papa	I was wondering if there was a trick like that. Thanks.
2018-12-04 14:45:26	papa	Did you here Denis Villeneuve is going to direct a remake of Dune?
2018-12-04 14:47:41	kensanata	Nope.
2018-12-04 14:47:54	papa	Now you have.
2018-12-04 14:48:04	kensanata	The Spice must flow.
2018-12-04 14:48:14	papa	You betcha!
2018-12-04 14:48:45	papa	The future is clouded - I can't see whether the movie will suck or not.
2018-12-04 14:49:35	kensanata	I don't trust these eyes. Will the show me the movie I want to see, or the movie the Bene Tleilax want me to see?
2018-12-04 14:50:23	papa	There is no way to know the difference.
2018-12-04 14:56:48	~tomasino	i love dune so much
2018-12-04 14:56:54	~tomasino	but i'm worried about yet another movie
2018-12-04 14:58:22	papa	They're bound to get it right sometime if they keep trying. Monkeys and keyboards.
2018-12-04 14:59:43	papa	Thanks for installing Weechat. It helps for this to be my one stop Cosmic Voyage shop.

2018-12-04 15:03:27	kensanata	I used irssi for a while, too
2018-12-04 15:09:45	ben	irssi can't compete with weechat anymore imo
2018-12-04 15:10:00	ben	plus i've invested a lot of time in my weechat setup
2018-12-04 15:11:57	kensanata	Well, I've contributed to two IRC clients written in Emacs Lisp, so I already know that all time invested in this is time wasted!

2018-12-04 22:04:02	sebboh	is this related to that story in which space, or maybe just the galaxy, was divided into fast and slow zones, or something... like, physics was alerted in some geographic region (for lack of a better phrase) in order to try to limit the spread of something.

2018-12-04 22:12:14	sebboh	I read a story about ships and crews and programming.
2018-12-04 22:12:20	hyperboredoubt	From what I can tell, it is a human diaspora from Earth.
2018-12-04 22:12:54	hyperboredoubt	And they are chatting via something called QEC. I think it means "quantum entanglement communication".
2018-12-04 22:13:17	sebboh	ansibles. :)

2018-12-04 22:33:44	~tomasino	i'm at my new apartment

2018-12-04 22:34:27	~tomasino	yep, ansibles. in fact, one ship is using that term instead
2018-12-04 22:37:53	~tomasino	sebboh: this universe isn't related to that one, but you're welcome to grab a ship and make that a thing. Everyone is so far away that things might work different where you are
2018-12-04 22:56:54	alexis	The ‘fast zone/slow zone’ thing might be from The Expanse, which I recommend without reservation to those not yet familiar. 
2018-12-04 22:56:58	alexis	Also, welcome, sebboh!
2018-12-04 22:57:19	alexis	And congrats on having the move behind you, tomasino. 
2018-12-04 22:57:57	alexis	(I should note, that recommendation is for the books! Not the shows, which...well, season 1 isn’t so bad.)
2018-12-04 23:00:50	hyperboredoubt	What should I put in Murmur Den's description, alexis?
2018-12-04 23:04:20	~tomasino	something hivey
2018-12-04 23:07:03	hyperboredoubt	Yes, but preferably without the stereotypical bug theme.
2018-12-04 23:11:32	alexis	There’s nothing wrong with bugs, in my opinion. Except flies.
2018-12-04 23:11:35	alexis	Fuck flies. 
2018-12-04 23:11:49	alexis	But your question isn’t really one I can answer. 
2018-12-04 23:12:27	alexis	Well, not beyond something anodyne and useless like ‘whatever you think fits best’. 
2018-12-04 23:13:11	jan6	18:11:35          alexis | Fuck flies.    
2018-12-04 23:13:15	jan6	and mosquitoes
2018-12-04 23:14:40	alexis	I’d have to agree they are as noxious. But I don’t hate them the same way.
2018-12-04 23:16:20	jan6	for me it's slightly reversed, cause there aren't much flies around here, and they usually don't specifically home in on you
2018-12-04 23:17:30	alexis	My apartment building is quite old and has not always been as well maintained as it might be, and so, despite all the prophylaxis our exterminators provide, we have periodic infestations of drain flies.
2018-12-04 23:17:41	alexis	Loathsome filth-breeding things.
2018-12-04 23:17:49	hyperboredoubt	Should Murmur Den be a polyamorous hivemind?
2018-12-04 23:17:54	alexis	And mosquitoes don’t make me itch. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2018-12-04 23:18:50	~tomasino	hyperboredoubt: does your hive even have genders anymore?
2018-12-04 23:19:03	alexis	Polyamorous in what sense? I can think of a couple and I’m not sure which among them you might mean.

2018-12-04 23:21:58	hyperboredoubt	Not sure, tomasino, haha. Which senses do you mean, alexis?
2018-12-04 23:23:29	alexis	Depending on how closely integrated a mind it is, it might contain aspects which regard themselves as components of the whole, rather than being fully unitary. In that case, there could exist romantic and/or sexual associations among those aspects. 
2018-12-04 23:24:20	alexis	Or it might be a more unitary mind, and be not averse to polyamory among other minds and/or ‘distantly-related biologicals’.
2018-12-04 23:24:46	alexis	Or both, or something else, in any combination.
2018-12-04 23:25:24	alexis	And I wouldn’t consider having genders a prerequisite for having sexuality. Evolving it might require sexes, but minds have more latitude.
2018-12-04 23:27:42	alexis	And certainly I can’t see how gender would be a prerequisite for romance.
2018-12-04 23:29:45	~tomasino	so many possibilities
2018-12-04 23:29:49	~tomasino	you get to make it all up!
2018-12-04 23:38:30	hyperboredoubt	I'm thinking that the hiveship Murmur Den is an experimental transhumanist intentional community with some queer theory over/undertones. But something has gone wrong and they may be going mad.
2018-12-04 23:42:53	alexis	I’m thinking, for whatever such a thought may be worth, that that sounds like a wonderful place to start.
2018-12-04 23:45:15	hyperboredoubt	Either that or it is one human who has fractured his personality amongst several computer systems and artificial intelligences.
2018-12-04 23:47:22	alexis	Also a wonderful place to start. But I would say so, I suppose.
2018-12-04 23:48:49	hyperboredoubt	In any case, I should start thinking of how to respond to that anonymous post.
2018-12-04 23:48:50	alexis	Certainly I would find such an experience fascinating, even at one remove. But you may well be better served to write what you want to write, rather than what I want to read.
2018-12-04 23:49:44	hyperboredoubt	I'm just brainstorming. I'm very bad at forethought and planning, so I need feedback and external motivation to even care, lol.
2018-12-04 23:50:15	alexis	It would not surprise me if that post’s author had misgathered the nature of Murmur Den. The phrase ‘distantly-related biologicals’ could well have been as misleading as evocative in its implications.
2018-12-04 23:51:21	hyperboredoubt	Do tell.
2018-12-04 23:51:22	alexis	And that’s fair! Just that I have on occasion found myself accidentally and alarmingly persuasive beyond any deliberate intent, and thus tend to err on the side of reticence in my opinions and arguments.
2018-12-04 23:52:41	alexis	Oh, not much to tell, perhaps. The author read Murmur Den’s reference and assumed on that basis she (in the sense of ‘she’ for ships, expressing no assertion about the gender of her inhabitant(s)) must be an AI or other nonbiological construct.
2018-12-04 23:53:09	alexis	But that’s purely an assumption, and one made perhaps in haste and out of the desire to express a sense of fellowship.
2018-12-04 23:53:38	alexis	The post’s author would certainly not be dismayed to find that assumption erroneous.
2018-12-04 23:54:38	hyperboredoubt	My brain is doing a dumb. Which post are you referring to? Link if possible.
2018-12-04 23:54:44	alexis	Nor to find it confirmed. The post’s author spoke from the heart, and that heart has proven much larger than I think anyone, including the post’s author, may have expected.
2018-12-04 23:55:01	alexis	Oh! Sorry. The last, anonymous, post from Voortrekker.

2018-12-04 23:56:21	alexis	(Speaking of assumptions made in haste...)
2018-12-04 23:56:26	hyperboredoubt	Yes, that is the one.
2018-12-04 23:56:42	hyperboredoubt	"TO MURMUR DEN, IN PARTICULAR. "
2018-12-04 23:56:44	hyperboredoubt	You, too. You are a child of humanity as are we all. Though you are
2018-12-04 23:56:46	hyperboredoubt	so far beyond us in your attainments: you are our brother
2018-12-04 23:56:48	hyperboredoubt	nonetheless, and our sister. What the universe holds for you, I do
2018-12-04 23:56:50	hyperboredoubt	not know. Perhaps you will leave us entirely behind. But if you go,
2018-12-04 23:56:52	hyperboredoubt	know that you go with our love. We will not forget you. And perhaps
2018-12-04 23:56:54	hyperboredoubt	one day we will meet again, in a place where no shadows fall.
2018-12-04 23:57:00	alexis	That’s the one of whose author I spoke. 
2018-12-04 23:58:01	hyperboredoubt	I really want to respond that that. It is very well-written.
2018-12-04 23:58:54	hyperboredoubt	They are most likely responding to:
2018-12-04 23:58:57	hyperboredoubt	Dimly-related biological, we spite words.
2018-12-04 23:58:59	hyperboredoubt	Answer?
2018-12-04 23:59:01	hyperboredoubt	I'm my brain: external, extensive,
2018-12-04 23:59:03	hyperboredoubt	timeless in our nothings,
2018-12-04 23:59:05	hyperboredoubt	roots visible and free.
2018-12-04 23:59:16	alexis	Yes. 
2018-12-05 00:01:23	hyperboredoubt	I like how I accidently made a tone shift in the post from annoyed to pensive.
2018-12-05 00:06:17	alexis	As do I.
2018-12-05 00:06:36	alexis	I can’t think offhand of anything I don’t like about that post. 
2018-12-05 00:07:50	hyperboredoubt	I think I'll keep with the <digested> schtick for a bit. It adds a bit of biological weirdness to computer output.

2018-12-05 00:15:24	sebboh	leaving work and I didn't read the whole back buffer, but... Flies we must keep.  They eat poop and become food.  Mosquitos are... blood suckers.  They become food for tons and tons of animals, but they are *literally* vampires minus the cool stuff.  It is fleas that can fuck right off.  Unlike mosquitos, no part of the ecosystem larger than them depends on them.
2018-12-05 00:17:44	hyperboredoubt	Thankfully, the Murmur Den is in no way affiliated with blood-suckers, be they insects or capitalists.
2018-12-05 00:18:26	alexis	I don't suppose I can argue with your points, sebboh. I do love swallows, after all, difficult though they be to keep in the frame.
2018-12-05 00:23:17	alexis	It will take me a while to change my opinion of flies, I suspect, even so.
2018-12-05 00:24:33	alexis	And I'm not sure what to think about capitalists. Taken to excess, sure. But everything is noxious when taken to excess. Even air.
2018-12-05 00:25:02	alexis	On the other hand, I am increasingly of the suspicion that, for many of my colonists, their original reasons for applying to join the mission were economic in nature.
2018-12-05 00:25:27	alexis	Wanting to give their children and loved ones a better life than the vast banlieues of their cyberpunk-dystopian homeworld could offer.
2018-12-05 00:26:01	alexis	It is certainly a problem that they should could find no better prospects on Earth than could be offered by a world orbiting another star.
2018-12-05 00:26:36	alexis	(Also that I used a double modal, just there, but I pray your indulgence on the basis of my present exhaustion.)
2018-12-05 00:28:46	alexis	I really have been overdoing it. I'd like to play Deltarune again before bed, but I don't have the time or the energy.

2018-12-05 02:40:27	~tomasino	anonpenetfi, yep
2018-12-05 02:40:28	~tomasino	lets see
2018-12-05 02:41:27	~tomasino	hrm, keys seem to match
2018-12-05 02:41:55	alexis	Hmm. Sec.
2018-12-05 02:42:35	alexis	Nope, still no joy, even when I explicitly specify the private key.
2018-12-05 02:42:50	~tomasino	hrm...
2018-12-05 02:44:05	~tomasino	no fail2ban
2018-12-05 02:44:11	~tomasino	jeez
2018-12-05 02:44:33	alexis	I can get in as alexis@ with that key, just not anonpenetfi@.
2018-12-05 02:45:10	alexis	Could it be an ownership thing? If the authorized_keys file was copied over but not chowned, sshd won't trust it.
2018-12-05 02:45:54	~tomasino	oooh, good call
2018-12-05 02:45:56	~tomasino	let me check
2018-12-05 02:46:01	~tomasino	i just added my own pubkey to it and i also can't get in
2018-12-05 02:47:27	~tomasino	nope
2018-12-05 02:47:30	~tomasino	permissions are good
2018-12-05 02:47:33	~tomasino	ownership too
2018-12-05 02:47:36	alexis	Dang.
2018-12-05 02:48:01	~tomasino	huh, i don't get it
2018-12-05 02:48:07	~tomasino	it's made the same way as everyone else
2018-12-05 02:48:31	alexis	I'm definitely offering the right key, per ssh -vvv - twice, actually. Not sure what could be up.
2018-12-05 02:48:56	~tomasino	yeah, me too
2018-12-05 02:49:08	alexis	Eh, as I said before, it's no big. I really am about to fall over, anyway; we can worry about it another time. Thanks for checking, though!
2018-12-05 02:49:40	~tomasino	i'll look some more tonight
2018-12-05 02:49:43	~tomasino	night!
2018-12-05 02:50:02	alexis	Oh, I'm not out quite yet. :) If you want to set a password on anonpenetfi and PM it to me so I can su over there and poke around, maybe more eyes will help?
2018-12-05 02:50:19	~tomasino	oh yes, there's a password
2018-12-05 02:50:21	~tomasino	let me check
2018-12-05 02:55:02	alexis	Good to go.
2018-12-05 02:55:31	alexis	I just nuked .ssh and recreated it. Best guess is perms on the directory were too open, but I accidentally nuked my shell history because my hands are stupid and tired just like the rest of me, so I can't go back and see.
2018-12-05 02:55:43	~tomasino	hah
2018-12-05 02:55:47	~tomasino	glad it's working
2018-12-05 02:55:53	~tomasino	now get some rest!
2018-12-05 02:56:01	alexis	Same! And, yes, it is now officially that time.
2018-12-05 02:56:44	alexis	Goodnight!

2018-12-05 11:08:28	kensanata	Hello fellow souls struggling for the light in the eternal darkness of space!
2018-12-05 11:11:28	alexis	Hello!
2018-12-05 11:12:26	alexis	You mentioned yesterday that you'd contributed to two Emacs IRC clients. If you don't mind my asking, which two? It could be I'm running some of your code right now.
2018-12-05 11:16:43	kensanata	erc and rcirc
2018-12-05 11:17:28	alexis	I am running some of your code right now. Thanks for that! rcirc is quite good.
2018-12-05 11:19:02	kensanata	Heh. Just tiny stuff. :) If you're new to rcirc, my top recommendation is https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/rcircColoredNicks
2018-12-05 11:20:17	kensanata	And my config file regarding rcirc: https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/emacs-setup/tree/config/rcirc-conf.el
2018-12-05 11:27:22	alexis	Ah, that's a considerably smarter method than I used, when I tried to do that some years back.
2018-12-05 11:28:50	alexis	I'll make a note to pull that into my config once I'm past my impending Emacs bankruptcy and won't just be making more work for myself by including it.
2018-12-05 11:29:48	kensanata	haha
2018-12-05 11:30:07	kensanata	Emacs is like space: cold, dark and infinite...
2018-12-05 11:31:49	alexis	A somewhat melancholy conception.
2018-12-05 11:31:59	alexis	Would you like to know what editor I used before I discovered Emacs? It was Notepad++
2018-12-05 11:32:00	alexis	.
2018-12-05 11:32:32	kensanata	I have Notepad++ installed on the office machine as well. It sure beats Notepad, Ultraedit, or Textpad...
2018-12-05 11:32:49	alexis	I rather favor the metaphor of having wandered, ignorant and foolish, far off the beaten tracks of the world I then knew, and stumbled carelessly into what seemed little more than an ancient cave, its mouth overgrown with Spanish moss and its shallower reaches full of twisty little passages, all apparently alike.
2018-12-05 11:33:37	alexis	At some point, I slipped and fell, and tumbled down a deeper hole. When I hit the bottom, I found myself in the control room of some kind of ancient space magic whose potency was entirely undimmed by the passage of eons.
2018-12-05 11:34:02	alexis	Then I started pushing buttons. By the time I started to have some sense of what I was doing, we were well past the heliopause...
2018-12-05 11:34:38	alexis	(And all my Windows boxes run Emacs, too. I carry around a Virtualbox image just for that purpose. I mean, sure, it's Windows and all, but I'm not going to be without my tools...)
2018-12-05 11:36:49	kensanata	Haha

2018-12-05 13:53:15	jan6	wordpad is basically what ms word SHOULD have been, fast, small, easy to use, etc

2018-12-07 02:57:09	cognifice	Isn't Traveller one of the few games in which your character can die during character creation?

2018-12-07 02:57:26	~tomasino	not sure, never played before
2018-12-07 02:57:31	~tomasino	Ego. The self, especially as distinct from the world and other selves.
2018-12-07 02:57:42	~tomasino	maybe it has something to do with that?
2018-12-07 02:57:49	cognifice	Maybe.
2018-12-07 02:58:00	cognifice	But in what way?
2018-12-07 02:58:04	~tomasino	something that allows your people to blend together hivey-like, but your ego skeleton allows you to stay individualized?

2018-12-07 15:05:58	sebboh	I have reviewed a bit of the transmissions and I don't think metalbaby is the story to tell.  Maybe someday.  Meanwhile may I have a ship named maninthemoon, tomasino?  Please?
2018-12-07 15:54:08	jan6	can't you create a new directory yourself and have it magically work?
2018-12-07 15:55:32	sebboh	maybe!
2018-12-07 15:56:27	jan6	try it out, you can always delete and ask to make it work for you ;P
2018-12-07 15:58:41	sebboh	using my existing ship as a template I see that it's a symlink to /var/gopher/metalbaby and I don't have permissions in /var/gopher to make another directory there.
2018-12-07 15:59:47	sebboh	now may I rename it
2018-12-07 15:59:52	sebboh	s/now/nor/
2018-12-07 16:00:32	sebboh	in any case there sure isn't any rush!  :)  writing is the hard part, methinks
2018-12-07 16:30:13	jan6	kay, sure!
2018-12-07 16:32:35	jan6	I guess toma$ino hasn't felt a need to do the user-directory-hosting other tildes do, and for some reason is just doing links to the system default place
2018-12-07 16:33:39	jan6	(/me would instead just copy/move stuff to there, instead of linking, you have to run a script in order to publish anyway afaik)
2018-12-07 16:33:53	alexis	I don't know that much about tildes in general yet, but this one seems unusual - among other things, the ability to have multiple 'user directories' (ships), which other tildes don't seem to support in quite the same way. A lot of this is being built out as we go along.
2018-12-07 16:34:06	jan6	user directories?
2018-12-07 16:34:19	alexis	The way ships are handled.
2018-12-07 16:34:24	alexis	It's not 1:1 between users and ships.
2018-12-07 16:34:39	jan6	afaik the only difference is being themed, and having custom paths for your content
2018-12-07 16:36:10	alexis	Again, I don't really know. But I have found tomasino uniformly open to changes and improvements, in the form of both suggestions and patches to the code that runs cosmic.voyage. And while I'm not really involved in running cosmic.voyage per se, only in helping maintain and improve cosmicbot, I would certainly be interested in seeing what improvements you have to offer.
2018-12-07 16:36:11	jan6	the x.tilde/~username is the default way servers work for user directories, for normal tildes it's enough, because there's no theme or stuff that'd justify it
2018-12-07 16:36:33	jan6	I don't even have an acount yet, lol
2018-12-07 16:36:38	jan6	s/co/cco/
2018-12-07 16:36:49	jan6	hmh
2018-12-07 16:37:05	jan6	tomasino: invite sedbot here, maybe?
2018-12-07 16:38:32	jan6	/invite sedbot
2018-12-07 17:13:55	morsecodemedia	The design is not accidental. The reaosn tomasino designed comsic.voyage the way he did is because users do not have accounts to the QEC, the ships do. Every ship reports to a single relay.
2018-12-07 18:19:59	sebboh	it's a game server for unixy players, not necessarily a tilde.  Though it is a member of the federated IRC network
2018-12-07 18:31:17	aewens	The ship/planet/etc assignment could be handled by a bot. Users could submit the request and if there's no response from tomasino during the hours he's awake on days he's active on the server (something that could be set by the bot) after X duration of time it will automatically assign the ship to the user.
2018-12-07 18:36:24	morsecodemedia	aewens - that sounds awesome. you could make a pull request. the repo is hosted on https://tildegit.org/cosmic/cosmic
2018-12-07 18:36:57	aewens	Hmm, good to know. I might add that sometime today or this weekend.
2018-12-07 18:48:08	sebboh	I'm ok with launching a ship being "expensive" in terms of time effort etc.
2018-12-07 18:48:47	sebboh	the only reason I want a new one is ... approximately: I don't like the name I picked and I haven't posted anything yet.
2018-12-07 19:03:07	aewens	morsecodemedia: Do you happen to know frequency that tomasino is on #cosmic? e.g. daily, weekly, fortnightly, etc

2018-12-07 19:14:45	~tomasino	Id very much like to automate the requests and have it cron-process 
2018-12-07 19:14:59	~tomasino	i dont need to manually do this step
2018-12-07 19:15:45	jan6	mail, maybe?
2018-12-07 19:16:24	~tomasino	maybe. more likely ill modify the script so it can run as a user

2018-12-07 19:17:31	~tomasino	im using the directory structure for a bunch of other stuff, including the roster
2018-12-07 19:18:28	jan6	idea being, instead of symlinks to the system directory where people don't have permission, just copy their directories to there, should work with nonexistant ships too?
2018-12-07 19:18:30	~tomasino	im sure it could have been architected a billion different ways, but this is how i felt most in control of the shape of things
2018-12-07 19:19:43	~tomasino	otger than new ship creation, what benefits would that offer to balance the rewrite?
2018-12-07 19:22:29	khuxkm|lounge	alexis: "helping maintain and improve cosmicbot" yep, that sounds like your job description :P meanwhile my job description is "made cosmicbot"

2018-12-07 19:27:23	~tomasino	i think ive got a way to make ship requests easy and user controlled
2018-12-07 19:27:35	~tomasino	ill build it out shortly when on a comp
2018-12-07 19:27:55	aewens	tomasino: I also had some requests, but it was sent via email.
2018-12-07 19:28:51	~tomasino	oh cool 
2018-12-07 19:28:56	~tomasino	ill read!
2018-12-07 19:29:01	aewens	Thanks!
2018-12-07 19:30:03	~tomasino	gotcha aewens . ill get you those in just a few
2018-12-07 19:30:05	aewens	khuxkm|lounge: Are there plans for cosmicbot to use the RSS feed to relay new ship logs here? If not, I can pretty quickly add that into Babili since it already does something similar for tilde.news
2018-12-07 19:30:23	aewens	tomasino: Awesome, thank you
2018-12-07 19:30:27	~tomasino	i yhink the bot announces logs already
2018-12-07 19:30:42	~tomasino	not sure if its using the rss or not
2018-12-07 19:30:43	khuxkm|lounge	it already does that
2018-12-07 19:30:47	khuxkm|lounge	it uses rss, yes
2018-12-07 19:30:47	khuxkm|lounge	gtg
2018-12-07 19:33:06	aewens	If it does, it must have a quite a delay since I haven't seen it mirror either of mine yet after I posted them.
2018-12-07 19:33:09	 *	aewens shrugs
2018-12-07 19:33:53	~tomasino	run cosmic-web
2018-12-07 19:34:03	~tomasino	itll force a web and rss rebuild
2018-12-07 19:34:19	~tomasino	it runs every 15 min on its own
2018-12-07 19:35:16	aewens	Just did. I think I might add a PR to have it provide some success message, it doing nothing on success is a bit concerning.
2018-12-07 19:35:36	~tomasino	:) ok!

2018-12-07 20:08:40	~tomasino	your ships are ready
2018-12-07 20:09:05	~tomasino	and i took what you were doing in the PR and merged it a similar thing, but in a slightly different place
2018-12-07 20:09:35	aewens	Nice! Thanks
2018-12-07 20:09:39	~tomasino	NP
2018-12-07 20:09:48	~tomasino	next up, cosmic-ship gets some lovin'
2018-12-07 20:15:54	alexis	aewens: I believe the RSS pull for new updates is hourly. Could be quicker; I have a PR open on cosmicbot now, I don’t mind taking that to say 15 min if khuxkm signs it off. 
2018-12-07 20:16:39	alexis	I’ll check for sure once I’m at keys again; I just had a tooth pulled and I’m not inclined to dislodge my lapful of cat just now.

2018-12-07 20:17:31	cosmicbot	alexis: Malkonkordo (by a​ewens)
2018-12-07 20:18:04	aewens	Yeah, hourly seems a bit overkill. I have Babili running every 8 secondson tilde.news's RSS feed  without any issues.
2018-12-07 20:18:14	jan6	lol
2018-12-07 20:18:21	jan6	I think 5 min is a good balance
2018-12-07 20:18:30	alexis	Also, fyi: line wrapping isn’t automatic in posts, whether viewed via gopher or web. We usually shoot for 67 but anything up to 80 is fine.
2018-12-07 20:18:31	aewens	Also, why is ther a space in my name?
2018-12-07 20:18:42	~tomasino	in the roster?
2018-12-07 20:18:43	jan6	there isn't if you do utf8 correctly ;P
2018-12-07 20:18:56	alexis	It’s a zero-width nonbreaking space, and it’s there so you don’t get highlighted every time someone rosters you. 
2018-12-07 20:19:15	jan6	better approach is to do something else
2018-12-07 20:19:22	alexis	Such as?
2018-12-07 20:19:23	jan6	like add irc-legal characters
2018-12-07 20:19:35	alexis	IRC makes no charset assertion of which I’m aware. 
2018-12-07 20:19:48	jan6	well
2018-12-07 20:20:04	jan6	nicks are required to be only of a few characters
2018-12-07 20:20:09	jan6	on most ircds, at least
2018-12-07 20:20:22	jan6	you cannot have a ↓ in your name, for example
2018-12-07 20:20:36	alexis	Yes. What has that to do with this?
2018-12-07 20:20:43	jan6	but something like Test Ship |jan6| should work, imo
2018-12-07 20:20:52	alexis	Yes. And it will highlight. 
2018-12-07 20:20:59	jan6	since | is a legal char, as is _ it will not
2018-12-07 20:21:16	jan6	if |alexis| highlights then your highlighter is broken
2018-12-07 20:21:35	alexis	Must be a lot of broken IRC clients out there, then. 
2018-12-07 20:21:37	~tomasino	my roster script is using | as a delimiter out of laziness, so if you decide to make a ship with | in the name let me know
2018-12-07 20:21:38	jan6	nope
2018-12-07 20:22:01	jan6	no irc client highlights on that, afaik
2018-12-07 20:22:21	jan6	nor on _alexis_
2018-12-07 20:22:36	jan6	color, sure, ping, nope
2018-12-07 20:22:41	alexis	That actually doesn’t, in either of my clients.
2018-12-07 20:22:56	aewens	tomasino: You could use %% as the delimiter. People are far more likely to use | than %% in a ship name
2018-12-07 20:23:06	alexis	If you want to open a PR to change it, it’s https://tilde.git/khuxkm/cosmicbot, iirc.
2018-12-07 20:23:17	alexis	Or not.
2018-12-07 20:23:20	~tomasino	yeah, easy fix and the | won't break anything if you use it other than the awk in roster
2018-12-07 20:23:23	aewens	sed -i "s/\|/%%/" /path/to/roster_file
2018-12-07 20:23:25	 *	jan6 is using jan6| on a second connection and never gets pinged for wrong nick

2018-12-07 20:27:26	alexis	Works for me! (Hey, it's your server...)
2018-12-07 20:27:46	khuxkm|lounge	aewens: it checks every minute

2018-12-07 20:31:35	alexis	Hmm. It looks like the bot hasn't been catching RSS updates for a while. The RSS feed is up to date, but the last bot notification is, like, eight behind?
2018-12-07 20:32:33	~tomasino	aewens: your PR has the changes from your last PR in there as well, so I can't merge it
2018-12-07 20:32:44	alexis	Let me know if I can help investigate that. Otherwise I'll stick with the stuff I was already going to be doing this afternoon around cosmicbot #2.
2018-12-07 20:32:55	~tomasino	who wants to help me test ship creation?
2018-12-07 20:34:18	~tomasino	okay, morsecodemedia helped me test

2018-12-07 21:22:47	aewens	My terminal has text encoding set to UTF-8, so maybe it's a weechat config thing?
2018-12-07 21:23:20	~tomasino	or tmux if you use that
2018-12-07 21:23:27	~tomasino	every layer needs utf-8
2018-12-07 21:23:39	ben	yup check every layer
2018-12-07 21:24:42	alexis	Honestly, I'm starting to think the Unicode thing is more trouble than it's worth in this case. The intent is to have it work with total transparency, such that nobody ever has to notice or care that the extra character's present, but in practice it appears to be having the opposite effect.
2018-12-07 21:24:59	alexis	I don't mind going with underscores instead, if it's generally considered worthwhile.
2018-12-07 21:25:55	~tomasino	how about usernames get printed like t.o.m.a.s.i.n.o.
2018-12-07 21:25:57	aewens	I think it might have been an issue with `screen`?

2018-12-07 21:29:47	khuxkm	surely a nick would have at least one of those chars?
2018-12-07 21:30:27	alexis	I do like the idea of keeping nicks in roster human-legible, as long as they're masked from highlights. jan6's suggestion of sticking underscores on either side appears to have merit; I'm mildly inclined to go that route, as long as it works for everyone, but totally open to strongly felt preferences otherwise.

2018-12-07 21:56:15	jan6	qec works via magic quantum timey wimey
2018-12-07 21:58:43	aewens	khuxkm|lounge: As I understand it, QEC is a relay that receives low bandwidth messages through the magic of quantum entangled particals. This allows it to work over long distances, but due to the nature of space-time you can get a message from the year 3000, followed by a message from the year 1000, than another from the year 3001.
2018-12-07 21:59:48	aewens	So in theory, if two ships are near each other both spacially and in time they could use QEC to communicate in real-time.
2018-12-07 21:59:49	fosslinux	?????????????
2018-12-07 21:59:55	fosslinux	i see waht you mean
2018-12-07 22:00:04	fosslinux	but half of it went over my head
2018-12-07 22:00:09	khuxkm|lounge	i mean, tomasino has expressly stated some basic details of QEC
2018-12-07 22:00:55	aewens	Has he? I'm going going by the home page along with my personal understanding of quantum physics and it's usage/application in modern sci-fi.
2018-12-07 22:01:10	aewens	There should be a wiki or something for this
2018-12-07 22:15:12	aewens	But yeah, if there's a pre-defined list of rules to the workings of the QEC, I'd like to know them before proceeding with my logs. Lest I inadvertently violate some law in this world's quantum physics.
2018-12-07 22:19:06	alexis	The rules, as I understand them, are: * There is no propagation delay; messages are instantaneous, in a frame of reference independent of both the sender and the receiver. * Messages once sent cannot be deleted, and can be edited only from the point of origination. * Interfering with transmission en route is impossible; QEC comms can't be jammed.
2018-12-07 22:19:18	alexis	* Covert transmission is possible, but only with an entirely parallel infrastructure. It's easier to use the anon.penet.fi remailer (send mail to anonpenetfi@cosmic.voyage, with the title you want in the subject; the body will be reposted verbatim.)
2018-12-07 22:19:54	alexis	But I'd confirm with tomasino, whose idea it was in the first place; what I describe is as much how I've been using it for Voortrekker as how he's described it working.
2018-12-07 22:20:16	alexis	And I agree that a wiki would be an excellent thing to have; we're rapidly getting to the point where a somewhat more detailed primer on the 'verse will aid in onboarding new players.
2018-12-07 22:20:18	alexis	Writers.
2018-12-07 22:20:26	alexis	Word doer things withs.
2018-12-07 22:22:29	aewens	Okay, so by your analysis if Ship A sends a message to RS001, if Ship B is also connected to RS001 they would see the message at the same moment?
2018-12-07 22:23:34	alexis	Yes.
2018-12-07 22:25:09	aewens	Alright, that's about what I thought. The fun part I like is that Ship A and Ship B could be in different years but due to their connection to RS001 it's still instantaneous, right?
2018-12-07 22:25:59	alexis	Yup. For example, Voortrekker's frame of reference is contracted by two years and change versus Earth's, but messages sent from one to the other still take no time to arrive. So mail from Earth arrives "before" it was sent.
2018-12-07 22:26:58	aewens	Gotta like the mindblown-ness of quantum physics
2018-12-07 22:27:03	~tomasino	everything you guys have said is consistent with my intentions
2018-12-07 22:27:25	aewens	Also, is swearing allowed in the logs or are we keeping it family friendly here?
2018-12-07 22:27:39	~tomasino	but, we have the elastic rule of "reality drive" out there... so if things work "slightly" different in your story, we can pretty much hand wave it away
2018-12-07 22:27:42	alexis	I sure hope it's allowed! If it's not, I'm in trouble.
2018-12-07 22:27:49	~tomasino	See rule 1: RE: blowing up earth
2018-12-07 22:28:01	~tomasino	write what you like

2018-12-07 22:28:19	aewens	Wait, what about the reality drive?
2018-12-07 22:28:43	~tomasino	i mentioned reality drive in one of my logs. They exist, they make the rules get hazy
2018-12-07 22:28:54	aewens	Which log?
2018-12-07 22:28:54	~tomasino	it's just something out there we can use to explain away inconsistencies if we need it
2018-12-07 22:29:00	~tomasino	um, my second, i think

2018-12-07 22:33:35	~tomasino	aewens: much prettier post with the wraps
2018-12-07 22:35:58	aewens	I didn't realize there wasn't already word-wrapping done on the CSS side. I now have cc=81 in vim to make sure it stays that way for future logs
2018-12-07 22:36:15	aewens	I also added the edit khuxkm|lounge suggested
2018-12-07 22:41:24	~tomasino	yeah, the web is designed to mimic gopher as closely as possible
2018-12-07 22:46:06	aewens	As a newbie to gopher, I should probably research it a bit more since I'd decided to jump into the deepend and join a tilde server revolving around it xD
2018-12-07 22:46:22	alexis	It's beautifully simple.
2018-12-07 22:46:47	alexis	And it can't execute arbitrary code on the client, so it's already better than the web. :p

2018-12-07 22:58:01	alexis	Well, you're not wrong. The retro aesthetic is something we're deliberately going with for this project, but it's also one reason why, absent the desire for that aesthetic, I likely wouldn't choose gopher as a primary publishing platform in general.
2018-12-07 23:00:48	jan6	goper itself doesn't define linewraps, y'know
2018-12-07 23:01:31	alexis	It doesn't, but I've yet to see a client that handled soft wrapping very well, and rarely one that does so at all.
2018-12-07 23:01:34	jan6	it's just "backwards compatibility" of everything which enables it by default
2018-12-07 23:02:07	jan6	and if it's default, why bother with coding wrapping ;P

2018-12-07 23:50:48	alexis	I appreciate it, but on reflection I think I won't. I see no way for any answer you might give to be other than a spoiler, and that would be a shame.
2018-12-07 23:52:18	kensanata	Well, all I can say right now is that I don't have a plot for the future. It is as unknown to you as it is to me. I have a thought or two on this page: https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2018-12-02_Writing_Science_Fiction

2018-12-08 01:50:51	aewens	tomasino: I am confused about both rules #1 and #2
2018-12-08 01:51:19	aewens	Are you saying that I can blow up earth? And what's the intention behind rule #2?
2018-12-08 02:17:36	alexis	You can blow up Earth. But since we're all working at more or less different parts of the same timeline, if you blow up Earth, it's liable to screw up somebody else's story. So the rule is, if you blow up Earth, it and your story overall retroactively happened and are happening in an alternate universe as a result of a reality drive mishap.
2018-12-08 02:17:45	alexis	In that alternate universe, everyone has a goatee.
2018-12-08 02:18:17	alexis	And rule 2 is, if somebody highlights you between three dashes in IRC, you have to pretend you can't see them.
2018-12-08 02:18:26	alexis	That one's pretty new and I don't know if we've worked out all the nuances yet.
2018-12-08 02:19:43	alexis	(The actual rule is that there aren't really any rules, but story incompatibilities are handwaved away by one or the other of the incompatible stories happening in a universe next door to this one.)
2018-12-08 02:22:52	alexis	(Although I don't really know, we haven't run into a situation like that yet. Right now it's just kind of a shrug and a "well, if stuff gets real conflicting, we can fall back on 'eh, reality drives, what can you do?', right?" sort of thing.)

2018-12-08 11:53:25	kensanata	Yo
2018-12-08 11:54:26	papa	Good CV intro page on your site.
2018-12-08 12:04:56	kensanata	Thanks. 
2018-12-08 12:06:30	kensanata	I guess we could put a copy on Cosmic Voyage and keep it up to date with whatever's new?
2018-12-08 12:12:57	papa	If that fits tomasino's minimal function plan.
2018-12-08 12:13:46	papa	I've got to write another post.
2018-12-08 12:25:14	kensanata	And I have to think about where I want to take the story... It's weird. If I decide to skip ahead a few years, how would I explain the ongoing QEC communications? "Magic" is the easy way out... Or do we basically say: when cosmic voyage started we sort of assume that we're all in the same timeline with FTL communicatinos being relayed?
2018-12-08 12:30:50	papa	I imagine that the QEC messages are actually chronologically scrambled due to the different frames of reference of the senders. All of our date stamps are whatever the author chooses. It's just random luck when two messages arrive at close to the same time.
2018-12-08 12:31:36	papa	Only that doesn't answer how the messages from a given ship always arrive in order.
2018-12-08 12:32:34	papa	THAT would be a good idea for a thread -- write up the whole message history off-line, then submit it piece-by-piece in reversed or random order.
2018-12-08 12:40:15	papa	Actually, I think I might use that idea in my current thread.
2018-12-08 12:57:11	kensanata	Do it. :)
2018-12-08 12:58:51	papa	will, but now i have to write a prequel
2018-12-08 12:59:39	kensanata	Haha.

2018-12-08 17:23:26	aewens	I've finally finished the backlog of RS001. So far, I think the story from Voortrekker has been my favorite to follow.
2018-12-08 17:24:17	aewens	Also, the crew of Malkonkordo has dispatched their latest message to RS001. May we live in interesting times.
2018-12-08 17:28:04	alexis	codingquark: You can use irssi in an ansi-term buffer, or use ERC, rcirc, or circe for native elisp IRC clients.
2018-12-08 17:28:24	alexis	I prefer rcirc myself, but ERC is also part of Emacs; it’s worth trying both.

2018-12-08 17:29:12	codingquark	Have been using erc for more than a year now. Since irssi supports XMPP, I thought I will give it a try.
2018-12-08 17:29:36	codingquark	But no encryption support for XMPP. Hence decided to not to use irssi.
2018-12-08 17:31:50	aewens	I'm personally using weechat, but I might give ii a try later on, seems interesting

2018-12-09 02:56:45	~tomasino	I thought your latest one was talking about an emerging AI at first, or maybe something new being created in the hive. I'm not 100% sure, though
2018-12-09 02:57:07	~tomasino	it was really interesting. trying to follow it is fun
2018-12-09 03:00:00	hyperboredoubt	I use a lot of experimental techniques, so even I don't know what things mean. Haha.  I leave it to interpretation.

2018-12-10 18:21:52	aewens	alexis / khuxkm|lounge: Let me know when !latest / RSS polling is fixed. Until then, I added in cosmic.voyage to Babili's RSS polling thread to mirror updates.
2018-12-10 18:22:27	aewens	It won't do !latest, but if someone posts something new it'll mirror it here 16 seconds after the RSS feed updates.
2018-12-10 18:23:32	alexis	Awesome, thanks! FWIW, I have no current plans to open a new PR on cosmicbot for that fix. Python threading foibles are extremely not my forte, and this is going to be a busy week for me as it is; I’ll be lucky to pry loose enough time to update Voortrekker.
2018-12-10 18:25:12	aewens	No problem! Also, I love the stories for Voortrekker and I'm anxiously awaiting it's next update. Keep up the good work!
2018-12-10 18:25:58	aewens	Also, you can see how I'm handling threading in Babili (which is done in Python) here: https://tildegit.org/aewens/babili-bot/src/branch/master/bot/tasks.py
2018-12-10 18:29:24	alexis	Thanks! I’m looking forward to Voortrekker’s next update, too; I know where I mean the story to go in general, assuming as always my characters don’t have other ideas, and in either case I can’t wait to see it play out.
2018-12-10 18:30:08	alexis	For that matter, I can’t wait to catch up on all the updates I’m behind on!

2018-12-10 20:47:30	aewens	If the story mirroring in cosmicbot gets fixed and I miss it, just use `!summon aewens <message>` to notify me. I'll take away Babili's cosmic voyage mirroring then so it's not double-posting to the channel.
2018-12-10 20:47:55	~tomasino	:) cool aewens
2018-12-10 20:48:10	~tomasino	have you looked at khuxkm|lounge's code? maybe you can fix whatever his issue is
2018-12-10 20:48:54	aewens	Once I'm done dealing with the project I'm working on now I'll look at it.
2018-12-10 20:48:58	~tomasino	awesome
2018-12-10 20:49:12	~tomasino	i'm working on something else too, which I think everyone's gonna enjoy
2018-12-10 20:49:27	jan6	just have babili PM the rss to cosmic, which relays it here ;P

2018-12-10 20:50:28	aewens	jan6: I could totally do that, might be a faster way to fix cosmic's issue if it isn't obvious.
2018-12-10 20:50:33	jan6	demosthene$ either
2018-12-10 20:51:03	aewens	Except then it would have BabiliBot as a dependency, which I'm not sure how khuxkm|lounge / everyone else would feel about that

2018-12-10 20:52:09	khuxkm|lounge	aewens: please do take a look at my code, hopefully it won't come to outsourcing RSS
2018-12-10 20:52:28	~tomasino	if you start a new shell in cosmic, you can now type 'faq'
2018-12-10 20:52:45	~tomasino	/var/wiki/ is editable to add stuff. Follow the pattern
2018-12-10 20:52:52	jan6	faq should probably be parallel to wiki imo
2018-12-10 20:53:09	~tomasino	at the moment faq is just a page on the wiki
2018-12-10 20:53:16	~tomasino	but feel free to change it up as you all see fit

2018-12-10 20:59:11	aewens	tomasino: Should be interesting to see how it all plays out. My second-to-last message had a reply to Starbloom in it.
2018-12-10 20:59:32	~tomasino	the one where you wrote little bits to a bunch of people?
2018-12-10 20:59:49	aewens	To two people, but yeah.
2018-12-10 21:00:34	~tomasino	ah yeas

2018-12-10 21:02:06	~tomasino	maybe midi
2018-12-10 21:02:28	aewens	tomasino: It's in the first paragraph/section/whatever it is I'm doing with my formatting.
2018-12-10 21:02:46	aewens	And also in the title, technically
2018-12-10 21:03:22	alexis	...checkmate, atheists.
2018-12-10 21:03:48	aewens	Oh my god xD

2018-12-10 21:07:44	~tomasino	okay, permissions will correct themselves on the wiki nightly
2018-12-10 21:10:45	~tomasino	and the wiki is now part of the system backup
2018-12-10 21:15:40	khuxkm|lounge	tomasino: so are you backing up /var/{gopher,wiki} in the backups? (since it was just /var/gopher before)
2018-12-10 21:16:58	jan6	why not /var/*
2018-12-10 21:17:30	~tomasino	i don't want to back up everything in var to a publically visible git repo
2018-12-10 21:17:54	~tomasino	i'm just backing up content, also
2018-12-10 21:18:06	~tomasino	i run system backups on the whole machine
2018-12-10 21:18:21	~tomasino	but i want my scripts in a happy spot and the hard work people write in a safe spot
2018-12-10 21:18:28	jan6	k
2018-12-10 21:20:21	~tomasino	i'd feel so bad for tildegit if it started getting hit by /var/log/* ;)

2018-12-11 19:52:47	~tomasino	fosslinux: it's a good point. There's the balancing act. If I make it available to people without the shell's involvement it's no longer a pubnix/tilde. It's a web app through and through and it loses spirit. On the other hand it would allow for easy writing.
2018-12-11 19:53:38	~tomasino	I hesitate to go to that level. I want it to be easy, but i want to ensure it stays pubnix
2018-12-11 19:55:32	aewens	You could consider target outreach. You started right by targetting people already in the tilde scene, but once you saturate that populace you'll want to find where writers are at and lure the tech guys from there.
2018-12-11 19:57:40	aewens	Something that may help for getting the less tech-savy would be a more clear-cut on-boarding guide for those that are less tech inclined.
2018-12-11 19:58:09	~tomasino	more than the alex schroeder wiki post in the topic?
2018-12-11 19:58:20	aewens	But there's places like r/WritingPrompts to get at the writer populace.

2018-12-11 20:06:11	~tomasino	you'll need to log in again or create a new tmux pane to see it
2018-12-11 20:06:12	aewens	An alias sourced from what file?
2018-12-11 20:06:24	aewens	Oh, I use screen
2018-12-11 20:06:25	~tomasino	alias wiki='lynx -display_charset=utf8 --lss=/dev/null /var/wiki/index.html'
2018-12-11 20:06:32	~tomasino	or new screen window

2018-12-11 20:09:50	aewens	Hmm, logging out / back in didn't work.
2018-12-11 20:10:04	aewens	Oh well, I'll just pull it into ~/.bash_aliases
2018-12-11 20:10:41	~tomasino	it didn't work for you? huh
2018-12-11 20:10:44	~tomasino	that's annoying
2018-12-11 20:10:51	~tomasino	that script is supposed to run for everyone, i thought
2018-12-11 20:12:29	aewens	I just did `ln -s /etc/profile.d/aliases.sh ~/.bash_aliases` and re-sourced .bashrc and it's working now
2018-12-11 20:12:44	~tomasino	oh, cool!
2018-12-11 20:12:59	~tomasino	i wonder why it didn't work natively, though
2018-12-11 20:13:00	aewens	So at least for me it'll work without issue now
2018-12-11 20:13:10	~tomasino	it's working for morsecodemedia too

2018-12-11 20:13:14	~tomasino	more things to investigate
2018-12-11 20:14:16	aewens	Might be something useful in here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/438150/scripts-in-etc-profile-d-being-ignored
2018-12-11 20:14:53	jan6	why replace bash aliases if you can just copy the line of .bashrc that sources the aliases?
2018-12-11 20:15:51	aewens	Because my .bash_aliases on cosmic just had `qec`, and it looks like it's also in the aliases.sh file, seemed worthwhile to swap.
2018-12-11 20:16:17	jan6	sure
2018-12-11 20:16:29	ben	what if i don't even use bash
2018-12-11 20:16:29	jan6	as long as you don't want to add any of your own aliases ther
2018-12-11 20:16:45	jan6	theoretically .profile should be cross-shell
2018-12-11 20:16:54	ben	just make a little bash script in /usr/local/bin
2018-12-11 20:17:03	jan6	practically it seems bash ignores it if it has .bashrc
2018-12-11 20:17:20	ben	far more {port,reli}able than an alias for one shell
2018-12-11 20:17:21	aewens	ben: I feel if a user wants to use a non-standard shell, it's on them to fix their arcane issues.
2018-12-11 20:17:30	jan6	^same, ben
2018-12-11 20:17:32	ben	i don't think that's fair
2018-12-11 20:18:11	jan6	literally no excuses for alias over script in this case
2018-12-11 20:18:13	~tomasino	i can make it a script

2018-12-11 20:18:23	aewens	I don't think catering to every possible esoteric shell is not fair from a maintainer's perspective.
2018-12-11 20:18:26	~tomasino	seems like it'll be less prone to error
2018-12-11 20:19:32	jan6	echo -e "#!/bin/sh\nlynx -display_charset=utf8 --lss=/dev/null /var/wiki/index.html">/usr/local/bin/wiki;chmod +rx /usr/local/bin/wiki
2018-12-11 20:19:57	jan6	aewens: one thing you miss
2018-12-11 20:20:07	jan6	you SPECIFY the shell for a script
2018-12-11 20:20:32	jan6	so if you run zsh or fish normally, if you run a bash script, it's still bash that executes it
2018-12-11 20:20:35	~tomasino	kill your alias
2018-12-11 20:20:39	~tomasino	try 'wiki' now
2018-12-11 20:21:24	ben	aewens: you don't have to cater to any shells if you make it an executable in the default $PATH
2018-12-11 20:21:38	ben	plus you get to tell it what to execute it with in the shebang
2018-12-11 20:22:21	~tomasino	faq done too
2018-12-11 20:22:35	ben	:)
2018-12-11 20:23:24	aewens	tomasino: works
2018-12-11 20:24:11	~tomasino	all 3 aliases are gone and now scripts
2018-12-11 20:24:19	aewens	ben: Fair enough, for some reason I thought you were asking for multiple alias scripts for each shell, not just scripts in $PATH
2018-12-11 20:24:20	~tomasino	tada
2018-12-11 20:24:35	ben	lol no that's definitely not something i would advocate for
2018-12-11 20:24:39	ben	ya goober
2018-12-11 20:24:46	~tomasino	i'm going to re-structure my cosmic bin dir and switch to a make installer with stow
2018-12-11 20:24:53	~tomasino	i'm linking too many things manually these days
2018-12-11 20:24:55	aewens	That's why I was adamently against that idea xD
2018-12-11 20:24:55	~tomasino	;)
2018-12-11 20:25:35	ben	was this unclear?: 15:16 <ben> just make a little bash script in /usr/local/bin
2018-12-11 20:25:53	ben	i thought it was pretty clear lol
2018-12-11 20:26:04	~tomasino	mysterious ben, that's what we call you
2018-12-11 20:26:08	~tomasino	what does it all mean
2018-12-11 20:26:18	ben	it means that entropy is inevitable
2018-12-11 20:26:23	ben	heh
2018-12-11 20:26:48	~tomasino	life... finds a way
2018-12-11 20:30:00	aewens	ben: I may have missed that bit, whoops
2018-12-11 20:31:00	ben	lol ok
2018-12-11 20:31:06	ben	now u know ;)

2018-12-12 00:33:51	~tomasino	it's in morsecodemedia's story
2018-12-12 00:33:54	~tomasino	i guess we'll find out
2018-12-12 00:34:17	hyperboredoubt	Cool.
2018-12-12 00:34:22	~tomasino	yeah, i'm excited
2018-12-12 00:34:32	hyperboredoubt	I am trying to piece together the next aureolin post.
2018-12-12 00:34:50	~tomasino	i need to read xero's and the newest one

2018-12-12 01:36:38	~tomasino	damn, i love these xero carbon wells posts
2018-12-12 01:36:41	~tomasino	i'm rereading both
2018-12-12 01:37:42	~tomasino	oh nice, he's stashed a bunch of extras on a gopher hole: gopher://167.88.113.62:70/1/~wells
2018-12-12 01:37:44	~tomasino	haha
2018-12-12 01:37:51	hyperboredoubt	Cool.
2018-12-12 01:41:43	~tomasino	yeah, this is great. I love the extra dimensionality he's adding to the universe with off-QEC comms
2018-12-12 01:46:37	~tomasino	oh boy, inspirational stuff, and from Malkonkordo too
2018-12-12 01:46:42	~tomasino	time to write
2018-12-12 01:46:42	hyperboredoubt	I'm almost halfway through with my post. Then, I'll have to go through the struggle of putting it online, haha.
2018-12-12 01:48:23	~tomasino	:D
2018-12-12 01:56:09	~tomasino	I added another entry in the FAQ on how to log a message
2018-12-12 02:00:41	hyperboredoubt	Link?
2018-12-12 02:08:19	~tomasino	run "faq" on the command line
2018-12-12 02:08:26	~tomasino	or 'wiki' and browse to it
2018-12-12 02:10:50	hyperboredoubt	I'll try a bit later. Thanks for the information. :)
2018-12-12 02:20:36	~tomasino	added line numbers to log entries on the web
2018-12-12 02:21:10	~tomasino	i may look into doing something similar on gopher as well
2018-12-12 02:21:23	~tomasino	it's a precursor to pagination on the full log page
2018-12-12 02:21:31	~tomasino	you all write a lot!
2018-12-12 02:26:31	~tomasino	not sure if the reversed property works on Edge. No PC to test on
2018-12-12 02:26:48	~tomasino	doesn't matter, i guess. It's moving to chromium anyway
2018-12-12 02:50:09	hyperboredoubt	POSTED!
2018-12-12 02:50:24	~tomasino	huzzah
2018-12-12 02:54:27	hyperboredoubt	Tell me what you think. It is sort of a companion piece to the previous log entry.
2018-12-12 03:19:02	~tomasino	i'm gonna need fresh eyes, hyperboredoubt 
2018-12-12 03:19:09	~tomasino	it's too much for my tired brain

2018-12-14 15:49:19	~tomasino	can't wait
2018-12-14 15:49:51	~tomasino	i'm waiting for a few others to post again before i do another melchi
2018-12-14 15:50:09	~tomasino	i'm playing around with a makefile to replace "web"
2018-12-14 15:50:15	~tomasino	i think it'll be easier to maintain in the long run
2018-12-14 15:50:20	~tomasino	better dependency management
2018-12-14 16:36:50	ben	re: faster than light vs faster-than-light: use dashes if it's an adjective and no dashes if it's a comparative
2018-12-14 16:37:46	ben	eg: a faster-than-light <noun>
2018-12-14 16:37:54	ben	vs: our speed is faster than light
2018-12-14 16:44:52	~tomasino	that's helpful
2018-12-14 17:01:23	ben	that's how i understood it
2018-12-14 17:01:44	ben	compound dashed words are generally combined that way to use as an adjective
2018-12-14 17:01:59	~tomasino	yeah

2018-12-14 21:10:46	fosslinux	and....thats it
2018-12-14 21:10:48	fosslinux	whoops
2018-12-14 21:10:49	fosslinux	sorry
2018-12-14 21:10:59	fosslinux	i didnt realise there were so many
2018-12-14 21:11:06	~tomasino	i wasted most of today on a new script to generate the web contents
2018-12-14 21:11:09	~tomasino	it was beautiful
2018-12-14 21:11:14	fosslinux	:D
2018-12-14 21:11:27	~tomasino	but it was gnu make based and therefor died horribly on the spaces in ship names
2018-12-14 21:11:33	fosslinux	oh
2018-12-14 21:11:35	fosslinux	of course
2018-12-14 21:11:41	~tomasino	so, back to the old script
2018-12-14 21:11:50	~tomasino	it works fine, but it's kinda messy now
2018-12-14 21:11:53	aewens	I wasted about an hour figuring out how to spoof logins by stealing HTTP requests from web browsers.
2018-12-14 21:11:58	fosslinux	:P
2018-12-14 21:12:00	~tomasino	did you use curl?
2018-12-14 21:12:36	aewens	Nah, curl requires you to format the request. If you use `openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 | tee output` you can just copy/paste the headers in and be done with it.
2018-12-14 21:13:31	fosslinux	i wasted about three hours over the past week: 1. setting up a windows vm; 2. making a usb wifi adaptor work in the windows vm; 3. making the wifi work on school internet; 4. making ssh work on widnows; 5. working out how to ssh into the vm from the host (host-only networking); 6. establishing a ssh tunnel
2018-12-14 21:13:33	aewens	Obviously replace github.com with your target of choice. Just be sure to remove the "Accept-Encoding" header so it comes in plain text instead of compressed
2018-12-14 21:13:46	fosslinux	but now i can connect to school wifi on linux woooo
2018-12-14 21:14:37	~tomasino	or pipe it through gzip
2018-12-14 21:14:41	~tomasino	sweet
2018-12-14 21:15:12	aewens	tomasino: I couldn't find where the gzip part began or ended, so the gunzip command wouldn't take it.
2018-12-14 21:15:38	~tomasino	ahha
2018-12-14 21:15:41	aewens	Since the result in the "output" file from tee is a grab bag of SSL, HTTP headers, etc
2018-12-14 21:15:45	~tomasino	i do this thing sometimes: curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543a Safari/419.3" -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -s --raw -N "$1" | gunzip - | html2text -width 67 -nobs -style pretty | recode html | cat -s | less
2018-12-14 21:16:30	aewens	Sure, but I wanted something that would auto-login as the user logged in on the browser by swiping their cookies.
2018-12-14 21:16:45	~tomasino	that's handy
2018-12-14 21:17:42	aewens	Now, if I can find a quick way to rip the cookies from the site and export them using a bookmarklet, I might have something neat.
2018-12-14 21:18:38	aewens	That way I can walk up to an unmanned web browser, export them to pastebin or something and them import them into my own browser on a different machine.

2018-12-14 21:21:10	aewens	Oh, I suppose I can have a website that takes an HTTP request as an input, runs that openssl command on the server, and put the HTML into an iframe?
2018-12-14 21:21:36	~tomasino	i suppose that's doable
2018-12-14 21:21:56	~tomasino	what are you trying to accomplish?

2018-12-14 21:36:30	~tomasino	cron is now running that version every 15 min
2018-12-14 21:36:43	~tomasino	you can still run "web" yourself if you want

2018-12-14 22:15:41	kensanata	Hah, a new ship, another malfunction, another person waking up from cryo. My next ship is going to be 100% nominal from beginning to end. Just a background noise of "all according to plan", "all quotas met", "some kids born", and "mission accomplished" messages.

2018-12-17 19:26:51	ubergeek	(I find 75 chars to be a good spot to wrap at, sorry C64 users)
2018-12-17 19:28:27	khuxkm|lounge	really 70-80 chars are good unless you're producing content for a c64 or other 40col display
2018-12-17 19:30:50	jan6	over 80 is good if you're reading in anything newer than win95
2018-12-17 19:31:42	aewens	Whoops, forgot about that, one moment
2018-12-17 19:35:34	aewens	Fixed
2018-12-17 19:39:13	ubergeek	jan6: not on a mobile device...

2018-12-17 19:42:32	jan6	well, especially on a mobile device
2018-12-17 19:42:45	jan6	hard wraps are eeeeeeviiil, on mobile especially
2018-12-17 19:43:08	jan6	unless you have a tablet, which is not mobile, or unless you like to scroll around
2018-12-17 19:43:58	jan6	comfortable font size, phone screen, hard wrap, choose 2

2018-12-17 22:07:23	~tomasino	Razarac illustrated that my scripts have issues with unicode chars in ship names, at least in the filenames

2018-12-17 22:07:27	~tomasino	i need to dig into that more

2018-12-17 22:08:56	~tomasino	litle by little we get better
2018-12-17 22:09:02	~tomasino	i'm sure unicode names will come sooner or later
2018-12-17 22:09:19	jan6	2018-12-04 13:44:56 morsecodemedia relay one: this is the first and last message from Razarač. We are going to self-destruct for the fact that we have a fancy character in our name. God speed.
2018-12-17 22:09:44	jan6	the grep script for weechat is amazing
2018-12-17 22:10:55	~tomasino	haha, yeah
2018-12-17 22:11:19	~tomasino	I managed to make the ship renamer out of that incident, too
2018-12-17 22:11:21	~tomasino	so that's cool
2018-12-17 22:11:40	jan6	I demand a full unicode name tho, it shall be ▌←¯¦¯→▐

2018-12-17 22:13:20	~tomasino	so spacey
2018-12-17 22:14:03	jan6	▗▘▝▞▜
2018-12-17 22:15:04	jan6	heh, I could make a full on 4-bit encoding based on the fact you can split one character into unicode quadrants
2018-12-17 22:15:11	jan6	is it 4-bit? idk
2018-12-17 22:17:16	 *	jan6 sleeps, probably, most likely, now, finally
2018-12-17 22:18:22	~tomasino	night!
2018-12-17 22:19:16	jan6	I should think about the quadrant encoding tho, looks much prettier than base64, but not as efficient...
2018-12-17 22:20:56	aewens	You can then add a whole extra layer to the encoding by having certain patterns decode to different operations.
2018-12-17 22:21:38	aewens	e.g. if the first character is ▗
2018-12-17 22:22:10	~tomasino	oh boy, we're in for it now
2018-12-17 22:22:13	aewens	e.g. if the first character is "▗" then the following is a number, but if it starts with "▘" it's a series of characters
2018-12-17 22:22:43	~tomasino	write an encoder/decoder and add the script to cosmic
2018-12-17 22:22:45	~tomasino	:D
2018-12-17 22:27:40	aewens	I happen to be working out a spec for an encoder/decoder, so I might do something like this later on.
2018-12-17 22:28:39	aewens	Right now I'm working on scripts to make adding new entries to Malkonkordo easier. Simulating the metrics is getting to be taxing xD
2018-12-17 22:30:48	aewens	e.g. converting everything out of base10, having the "Position" header match the trajectories I have set, etc
2018-12-17 22:41:40	~tomasino	great plan
2018-12-17 22:41:55	~tomasino	i've got a really basic template functionality baked into log itself
2018-12-17 22:42:13	~tomasino	super basic... it just copies a .template file as a starting point to a new filename
2018-12-17 22:42:37	~tomasino	just sent everyone an email on the system
2018-12-17 22:42:50	~tomasino	2, actually, cause I can't type and fubar'd a sed line on the first go

2018-12-17 23:16:42	alexis	Nice.
2018-12-17 23:37:20	alexis	tomasino: Photosynthesis seems like a handy resource for people to have? I mean, assuming it stops there, and doesn't turn into The Thing by way of Day of the Triffids - or vice versa, I suppose.
2018-12-17 23:41:49	alexis	Also, extremely looking forward to finding out more about Oleander. That, and impressed: I wish I had the same fluency in different voices that you're showing.
2018-12-18 00:04:58	~tomasino	aww, shucks. Thanks alexis!
2018-12-18 00:05:16	~tomasino	brb, washing kid!

2018-12-18 00:19:33	~tomasino	okay, so the voices do sound different? I always worry they just sound like me

2018-12-18 00:21:07	alexis	I know the feeling! But, no, they sound quite different to me, Oleander especially.

2018-12-18 00:31:45	~tomasino	yeah, not too vague on the ending, eh?
2018-12-18 00:40:31	alexis	I feel like the preface gave a fairly broad hint, yeah. :D
