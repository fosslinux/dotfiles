2018-11-21 08:31:32	EvilSoul	howdy, how do i add myself on the BSD machine ?
2018-11-21 08:31:51	EvilSoul	and one more questions, are eggdrops allowed @ tilde ? 
2018-11-21 08:43:14	slipyx	i think benharri needs to manually transfer you over from the non-bsd ~team
2018-11-21 08:44:26	slipyx	and eggdrops could most likely be allowed, as for on bsd, just be aware it has significantly less resources than the main tilde
2018-11-21 09:15:26	EvilSoul	oh thank you
2018-11-21 09:15:30	EvilSoul	i will talk to him

2018-11-21 14:01:13	@benharri	EvilSoul: bsd accounts are all transferred over
