2018-11-21 16:21:40	furby	there could have been some fun tutorials on how to backup data..  along with a 30 day notice of shutdown
2018-11-21 16:22:03	dax	in my experience, when you get tired of running something for free, you get very completely tired very quickly
2018-11-21 16:22:29	dax	and, also in my experience, 30 day migration windows and documentation are something you don't necessarily get for free
2018-11-21 16:23:14	dax	or, to rephrase my first statement: "i don't have to do this, i'm done with it" tends to take motivation from 90% to 0%, not from 90% to 20%
2018-11-21 16:23:55	furby	i suppose, but a professional approach is still due the users, being in a position of owner
2018-11-21 16:26:52	dax	funny thing about the word "professional" is that when you look up it or "profession" in a dictionary, the word "paid" is involved in the definition ;)
2018-11-21 16:28:10	furby	if I got tired of running a free shell it would be 'okay I'm tired of this so gone in 2 weeks' or similar
2018-11-21 16:28:59	furby	the innocent users who trusted it have no clue
2018-11-21 16:29:22	dax	quite
2018-11-21 16:32:11	furby	personally, I always backup so not highly affected, but I have run shells and dealt with the good and bad..  the clueless especially..  it can be quite the chore

2018-11-21 23:29:47	Milkshake	fosslinux|: alpharacks. just wait for friday and there will be plenty of offers from other hostings
2018-11-21 23:30:36	Milkshake	furby: if you really intend to share a service, you need a big one dedicated server.
2018-11-21 23:31:23	Milkshake	you dont have to worry about internet and electric bills
2018-11-21 23:33:01	furby	elecric never seemed to factor much     but a big pipe yeah
2018-11-21 23:33:31	furby	and a vps seems good  because ddos
2018-11-21 23:33:53	furby	and big.... well uhhh   :)
2018-11-21 23:33:55	furby	who knows
2018-11-21 23:34:03	furby	depends on the madness ya want
2018-11-21 23:34:46	Milkshake	i am so eager to buy a raspbi and make it my own server, by leaving it on my mom's office. free electric and internet.
2018-11-21 23:35:00	furby	balanced against script kiddie paradise
2018-11-21 23:35:03	Milkshake	ddos? what do you mean
2018-11-21 23:35:52	Milkshake	what thunix did is insane, for free, cant always let whoever has unlimited processes and storage. you know this thing will get abused
2018-11-21 23:35:55	furby	ddos attacks   which some vpses protect agains
2018-11-21 23:36:23	furby	oh yes... great stuff from a home server
2018-11-21 23:36:29	furby	very generous
2018-11-21 23:37:02	furby	until the rtorrent kids arrive
2018-11-21 23:37:04	furby	etc.
2018-11-21 23:37:47	Milkshake	any free shell provider shouldnt give unlimited processes.
2018-11-21 23:38:25	Milkshake	where was hex came from again
2018-11-21 23:38:47	furby	simple fix in /etc/security/limits.conf

2018-11-21 23:40:03	Milkshake	oh ye. remembered one free shell provider in bg as well, fewona.
2018-11-21 23:41:22	furby	I even seen troll shells    where the admins raid everything
2018-11-21 23:41:32	furby	not so much fun
2018-11-21 23:41:42	furby	free yeah  but whatever
2018-11-21 23:41:57	furby	so much for your good code or processes
2018-11-21 23:42:06	furby	and info
2018-11-21 23:42:48	Milkshake	yeah man, i wouldnt upload something important on free shell/server.
2018-11-21 23:42:52	furby	but most people just love the fun of it
2018-11-21 23:43:00	furby	haaaa
2018-11-21 23:43:51	furby	some shells have good admins but you have hackers to deal with
2018-11-21 23:44:00	furby	always trying to get in
2018-11-21 23:44:03	furby	mess with things
2018-11-21 23:44:47	furby	so the admins all have to be on the same page
2018-11-21 23:45:14	furby	knowing roughly the same things, and teaching each other
2018-11-21 23:45:27	furby	network fun
2018-11-21 23:45:46	Milkshake	theyre everywhere. data is money. I myself even still crawling for any FTP and open directories i found in google
2018-11-21 23:46:06	furby	heh
2018-11-21 23:46:25	furby	there is/was a site that posted screenshots of   remote admin left open
2018-11-21 23:46:26	furby	doh
2018-11-21 23:46:36	furby	remote desktop     mostly windows
2018-11-21 23:47:35	Milkshake	trust me, some people even save their teamviewer password in .txt , and i used to get one, and that led me to one of hosting  staff' computer.
2018-11-21 23:47:40	furby	looking for  unsecured wordpress directories is fun
2018-11-21 23:47:47	Milkshake	and that was the moment i saw all their hosting data
2018-11-21 23:48:12	furby	skeery
2018-11-21 23:48:23	furby	whatever it is  out of the box...     modify it a lot
2018-11-21 23:48:31	furby	or the standard hacks will eat you alive
2018-11-21 23:49:23	Milkshake	yeah, even the hardened server get hacked. let alone unprotected one
2018-11-21 23:49:47	furby	always good to slow them down
2018-11-21 23:52:14	Milkshake	but some admins were genius, a honeypot and just allow the hackers try their things.
2018-11-21 23:52:18	furby	I have had to zi up /var/log/btmp     failed logins  because a good sustained attack will fill your drives with that file size
2018-11-21 23:52:24	furby	a gig in a few days
2018-11-21 23:52:37	furby	zip up
2018-11-21 23:53:11	furby	honeypots can be fun
2018-11-21 23:53:23	furby	reverse attack if ya like

2018-11-21 23:55:36	furby	IoT hacked
2018-11-21 23:55:41	Milkshake	tbh my servers never get hacked through bruteforce though.
2018-11-21 23:56:17	furby	cool
2018-11-21 23:56:33	Milkshake	but i used to get hacked when i gave shell account to someone
2018-11-21 23:56:45	Milkshake	the root was changed
2018-11-21 23:57:05	furby	a good server...  the worst they can to is tcp flood  ish
2018-11-21 23:57:20	Milkshake	but its fine, just go to solusvm and reinstall everything
2018-11-21 23:57:26	Milkshake	ye
2018-11-22 00:00:48	furby	and netfilter can handle a lot of that
2018-11-22 00:05:38	furby	hopefully this channel will live on for a while for more fun ideas
2018-11-22 00:21:04	Milkshake	idk man
2018-11-22 00:21:39	Milkshake	mostly shell provider have their own irc network, they aint stay in freenode
2018-11-22 00:28:21	furby	interesting point
2018-11-22 00:29:09	furby	I suppose there are many reasons for hosting a shell
2018-11-22 00:29:14	furby	the fun of it
2018-11-22 00:29:18	furby	to make money
2018-11-22 00:29:52	furby	the challenge
2018-11-22 00:31:06	furby	a public shell that is
2018-11-22 00:31:52	furby	I see a lot of shared vps     no home computer to trash
2018-11-22 00:32:11	furby	just a vps    either public or private
2018-11-22 00:32:47	furby	set up a pi on a severe firewall :))
2018-11-22 00:33:24	furby	couple gateways thrown in
2018-11-22 00:33:27	furby	heh
2018-11-22 00:36:52	Milkshake	yeah man, vps is cheaper nowadays. theres no reason not to get one
2018-11-22 00:39:33	furby	some people get big vps and sell off small accounts      so yeah it happens
2018-11-22 00:39:57	furby	not sure if there is enough money to make a living out of it though
2018-11-22 00:42:18	Milkshake	idk about that but i've seen a lot people paying something to get it managed. its where the profit comes from
2018-11-22 00:43:58	Milkshake	thats how consultancy firm make money, they know a lot of people are rookies and dont want to do it themselves.
2018-11-22 00:45:46	furby	same ish idea      some people will pay to get a bot hosted
2018-11-22 00:46:15	furby	but ppl can still buy a vps and sell accounts on it
2018-11-22 00:46:21	Milkshake	if youre really good at hacking, get yourself a certificate and just advertise yourself "I will audit your blog and server for only $100". you will get money
2018-11-22 00:46:36	furby	a vps with enough bandwitdh and storage
2018-11-22 00:47:18	furby	a lot of people don't know *nix but want too run things
2018-11-22 00:47:29	furby	windows people especially
2018-11-22 00:47:53	Milkshake	i barely hit 100GB bandwidth on any of my VPS. i dont even know why i purchased them
2018-11-22 00:49:59	furby	what could be fun is getting a hypervisor monster and selling vpses :)
2018-11-22 00:50:23	furby	and your hypervisor from a yet bigger monster :)
2018-11-22 00:53:34	furby	it depends if the hours are worth it to you
2018-11-22 00:54:20	furby	set proc limits, and a quota,  good firewall...   users are on their own  have fun
2018-11-22 00:54:33	furby	music bots :)
2018-11-22 00:56:06	furby	maybe some cgroup fun
2018-11-22 00:56:11	furby	tc and iptables

2018-11-22 06:01:20	fosslinux	theres plenty of other shells
2018-11-22 06:01:24	fosslinux	often known as tildes
2018-11-22 06:01:38	fosslinux	for example, tilde.team, tilde.town, yourtilde.com

2018-11-22 06:01:51	fosslinux	(i'm making that last one)
2018-11-22 06:02:04	snurryboy	I saw tilde.team but it seemed like some shared project thing. I just need a way to run znc and python
2018-11-22 06:02:07	fosslinux	none of them have quite as much disk space as thunix had
2018-11-22 06:02:21	fosslinux	tilde.team is basically thunix

2018-11-22 06:02:52	snurryboy	I’ll check it out
2018-11-22 06:03:00	fosslinux	i use tilde.team, it gives you a shell, a place to store files, host a website/gopherhole, etc
2018-11-22 06:03:13	snurryboy	From what I saw it was looking for people that wanted to work together on stuff
2018-11-22 06:03:18	fosslinux	yes

2018-11-22 12:59:58	snurryboy	Which was 0kb
2018-11-22 13:00:00	snurryboy	Lol
2018-11-22 13:01:32	Milkshake	theres hashbang.sh too, they got like 3 or 4 servers
2018-11-22 13:02:37	snurryboy	Yea if tilde decline me I’ll try there but I don’t need an account with both
2018-11-22 13:05:17	snurryboy	All I want is remote znc and python
2018-11-22 13:05:30	snurryboy	So resources really don’t matter to me
2018-11-22 13:06:27	Milkshake	have you backup your znc config in thunix?
2018-11-22 13:07:15	snurryboy	Ooh didn’t know I could I’ll do that now
2018-11-22 13:07:43	snurryboy	Can I do that in webadmin or just download a specific file/folders
2018-11-22 13:09:57	Milkshake	ftp maybe or with curl
2018-11-22 13:10:09	Milkshake	zip your znc directory first
2018-11-22 13:11:11	Milkshake	of course with password, and curl to https://file.io

2018-11-22 13:49:58	Milkshake	yea
2018-11-22 13:50:05	snurryboy	Aight
2018-11-22 13:50:53	Milkshake	if you already have your tilde account, just ftp from there
2018-11-22 13:51:54	snurryboy	Nah I only just applied a few hours ago
2018-11-22 13:52:27	snurryboy	But yea I figure I gotta compile znc then replace .znc
2018-11-22 13:53:13	snurryboy	Hopefully it works on different versions and I don’t think it will install the modules I’ll have to znc-buildmod or something

2018-11-28 19:55:57	furby	if you build it they will come  :)
2018-11-28 19:56:20	@Bercik	I'm not sure if anyone got entire home sent somewhere. Surely rootfs was not sent outside.
2018-11-28 19:56:51	furby	where do 'daily backups'  live?
2018-11-28 19:57:34	fosslinux	furby: if you're looking for some other free shell, see tilde.team, yourtilde.com
2018-11-28 19:57:47	@Bercik	they were on separate HDD inside thunix box, but daily dump was about 100G and there was not enough time to get it all.
2018-11-28 19:58:09	furby	am not hurting for a shell currently   just mildly curious  but redundant shells never hurt
2018-11-28 19:58:20	fosslinux	^ spin up a hetzner vps ; ocamlfuse mount to gd ; 10gbit connection
2018-11-28 19:58:34	@Bercik	that^ i do have multiple shells too, some mine (self hosted) some external
2018-11-28 19:59:07	furby	and rsync is your freeen   :)
2018-11-28 19:59:07	@Bercik	fosslinux, they got 10G down, but thunix didn't have 10G up speed
2018-11-28 19:59:40	furby	I imagine some large bandwidth use was going on
2018-11-28 19:59:53	furby	and processes
2018-11-28 20:00:21	furby	rtorrent a lot   or attempt bitcoin mining
2018-11-28 20:00:30	furby	or just randomly stream media
2018-11-28 20:01:11	fosslinux	lol
2018-11-28 20:01:20	fosslinux	what was thunix's speed?
2018-11-28 20:01:44	@Bercik	what's done, is done. I don't have time now to focus on that thing. Was happy to help occasionally, but now it's too much time consuming to set it up. Unless we get that HDD back.
2018-11-28 20:02:24	@Bercik	fosslinux, in theory, 1G, but as mentioned above. A LOT happened, and I mean a lot
2018-11-28 20:02:42	@Bercik	majority of time all CPUs were 100%, plus mining, plus torrents or what else it had
2018-11-28 20:03:09	@Bercik	one time i wanted to urgently send something and got speed <1MB/s over SSH
2018-11-28 20:03:20	furby	nothing like the constant roar of a tower fan
2018-11-28 20:03:50	furby	perhaps   /etc/security/limits.conf  and some  cgroup fun for bandwith   on future endeavors
2018-11-28 20:04:15	furby	some  tc iptables
2018-11-28 20:04:35	furby	a pain to setup   but sets limits and spreads out resources
2018-11-28 20:04:58	@Bercik	furby, i was proposing limits. refused
2018-11-28 20:05:04	furby	:/
2018-11-28 20:05:11	furby	oh well
2018-11-28 20:05:15	@Bercik	after all, I was just helping out.
2018-11-28 20:05:32	furby	yeah
2018-11-28 20:05:35	furby	all good
2018-11-28 20:05:36	furby	you tried
2018-11-28 20:05:40	@Bercik	hex said no, so I won't do anything against his will
2018-11-28 20:05:50	furby	admin can ba a pain when it's not your box
2018-11-28 20:05:55	@Bercik	same goes for quotas, proper sudo and what not
2018-11-28 20:06:13	furby	quota helps too
2018-11-28 20:06:27	furby	there will always be users who will hog it all if they can
2018-11-28 20:06:29	furby	sadly
2018-11-28 20:06:52	furby	or install 1337 things they don't understand
2018-11-28 20:09:08	@Bercik	that was other thing, thunix ran literally everything
2018-11-28 20:09:25	@Bercik	at some point i was thinking people did "apt-get install *"
2018-11-28 20:09:27	@Bercik	;D
2018-11-28 20:09:32	furby	it was quite generous
2018-11-28 20:09:41	furby	hah @  apt
2018-11-28 20:09:55	@Bercik	media streaming was probably cool, and few others - but gopher
2018-11-28 20:09:58	furby	don't forget chroot or proot :)
2018-11-28 20:10:04	@Bercik	i was surprised to see it's still in development.
2018-11-28 20:10:28	furby	there's even a gopher plugin for firefox
2018-11-28 20:10:38	furby	wais  would surprise me :)
2018-11-28 20:12:38	@Bercik	just had emergency yesterday, had to reboot my main server... 2147 days of uptime :(
2018-11-28 20:12:50	furby	yeow
2018-11-28 20:13:02	furby	hack the records :)
2018-11-28 20:13:03	@Bercik	I felt like I lost a child.
2018-11-28 20:13:10	furby	that's  lot of uptime
2018-11-28 20:13:19	furby	I got happy at 300+ days once :)
2018-11-28 20:14:47	@Bercik	i remember those days :D
2018-11-28 20:55:33	@amcclure	if I had a good machine I could host the server myself
2018-11-28 20:55:57	@amcclure	if anyone has suggestions, please let me know
2018-11-28 20:59:50	@amcclure	the sooner I can get a server, the sooner we could revive thunix
2018-11-28 21:00:05	furby	frys.com  ?
2018-11-28 21:00:10	furby	amazon?
2018-11-28 21:00:37	@Bercik	technically  - you don't need spaceship to run shell. i7 is not the only way to go.

2018-11-28 21:02:19	Milkshake	yeah, running your own rig for server takes a lot of money than just rent server in datacentre
2018-11-28 21:02:53	@Bercik	yup, I run 3 so can confirm :P
2018-11-28 21:03:08	Milkshake	you need to concern of electricity and internet bills. which alone need $200 or over monthly
2018-11-28 21:03:18	Milkshake	renting a server just cause less than $50 month

2018-11-28 21:03:34	benharri	rent a dedi from hetzner or soyoustart or something
2018-11-28 21:03:43	@Bercik	but renting has serious limitations (storage, traffic and what not)
2018-11-28 21:03:47	@Bercik	all depends on the needs.
2018-11-28 21:03:56	benharri	depends; there are some good deals
2018-11-28 21:03:58	@Bercik	arubacloud is awesome
2018-11-28 21:04:06	benharri	hetzner has unlimited traffic and plenty of storage configurations
2018-11-28 21:04:25	@Bercik	5PLN (1.20 EUR) / month for 20G SSD vps
2018-11-28 21:05:34	Milkshake	yeah, you can add/mount storage as much as you want. but heck, 2TB hdd is more than sufficient if you really implementing rules (no unlimited everything)
2018-11-28 21:06:05	benharri	disk quotas are important
2018-11-28 21:06:16	benharri	i don't see why you'd offer a remote shell without a disk quota
2018-11-28 21:06:18	@amcclure	there may have to be disk quotas

2018-11-28 21:48:01	benharri	metaarpa has access to a whole 'nother cluster
2018-11-28 22:06:43	furby	sdf  (super dimension fortress)  is  kinda cheesy
2018-11-28 22:06:49	furby	but been around forever
2018-11-28 22:08:26	furby	a lot of 'free shells'  give limited processes, and more if you pay
2018-11-28 22:09:09	furby	not so sure  'unlimited torrenting'  is out there anywhere :)
2018-11-28 22:13:53	benharri	oh that's definitely not something you can do on sdf

2018-12-04 02:45:37	dovahkin	Sorry?
2018-12-04 02:47:11	dovahkin	in any case, thunix was a good provider, I loved what I had, and honestly thought it was too good to be true when I first heard about it.
2018-12-04 02:47:35	dovahkin	I've been using the shell to run various different things
2018-12-04 02:47:45	dovahkin	Although I never did get to get my bouncer working
2018-12-04 02:50:18	@Naglfar	dovahkin, we are trying to make thunix continue
2018-12-04 02:50:39	dovahkin	I'm glad to hear that, like I said it was an awesome service
2018-12-04 02:50:49	dovahkin	How much are you looking for per person?
2018-12-04 02:51:02	dovahkin	Like a "If everyone gave x" thing
2018-12-04 02:52:08	@Naglfar	it depend what services we will be able to provide
2018-12-04 02:53:13	dovahkin	I mean, I don't have much, but I would be def ok with sending something to help, maybe collabing later

2018-12-13 02:24:27	brendantcc	i think benharri may have gotten it up and running - that would explain the SSH redir

2018-12-18 23:42:44	brendantcc	see if you can register it or something, amcclure, naglfar
2018-12-18 23:44:58	@Naglfar	on the case that we can register it again, we need to know if someone can afford renew it
2018-12-18 23:46:25	brendantcc	well it's like $1 or something right
