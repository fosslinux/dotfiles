2018-12-11 01:19:10	BabiliBot	[links-comments] I like this concept, particularly in the context of technology. Technology can so easily feed impatience and lead to people undervalue those around them. But it can also support connections between people in ways that increase empathy and appreciation. We have to very consciously decide how we want to use technology – or it will be imposed on us against our best interests. (posted by cmccabe) <https://tilde.news/c/fzfaio>
