2018-11-13 17:44:15	benharri	yo
2018-11-13 17:45:00	benharri	why'd you run nmap
2018-11-13 19:52:41	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-13 19:52:49	fosslinux	i wanted to find the ip of the host
2018-11-13 19:53:29	benharri	well you got us locked out
2018-11-13 19:53:36	fosslinux	really sorry
2018-11-13 19:53:39	fosslinux	:(
2018-11-13 19:53:46	fosslinux	i didn't realise i did that
2018-11-13 19:53:56	fosslinux	what did i get us locked out of?
2018-11-13 19:54:12	benharri	hetzner doesn't allow port/netscanning in their ToS
2018-11-13 19:54:18	benharri	so they locked the IP
2018-11-13 19:54:27	fosslinux	sorry
2018-11-13 19:54:29	benharri	server's still up but it's inaccessible
2018-11-13 19:54:46	fosslinux	im an idiot
2018-11-13 19:54:50	benharri	for future reference, you can do curl ipinfo.io
2018-11-13 19:54:56	benharri	or dig tilde.team
2018-11-13 19:55:09	fosslinux	i was trying to ssh back into ~team from my container
2018-11-13 19:55:22	benharri	now we have to wait for them to unlock the IP
2018-11-13 19:55:24	fosslinux	but i couldn't find the ip
2018-11-13 19:55:34	fosslinux	sorry for bringing everything to a halt
2018-11-13 19:55:44	fosslinux	can i still be on ~team
2018-11-13 19:55:46	fosslinux	?
2018-11-13 19:55:54	benharri	yeah just don't do any netscanning!
2018-11-13 19:56:23	benharri	usually 10/8 doesn't route, but hetzner has it set up to route to the default gateway for some reason
2018-11-13 19:56:42	benharri	i mean noone can be on ~team til we get the ip back
2018-11-13 19:56:57	benharri	i thought you were scanning the whole internet and i was very concerned
2018-11-13 19:57:15	fosslinux	oh lol
2018-11-13 19:57:23	fosslinux	i wasn't scanning the internet
2018-11-13 19:57:25	benharri	i killed the nmap process and i removed your ssh keys from the lxd container until i could figure out what the hell you were doing
2018-11-13 19:57:33	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-13 19:57:37	fosslinux	whatever
2018-11-13 19:57:54	fosslinux	i don't really care what you do to my stuff until this is all fixed
2018-11-13 19:58:04	fosslinux	since everything else is down i posted an apology on #!
2018-11-13 19:58:05	benharri	that's fair
2018-11-13 19:58:19	fosslinux	i've got it all on my local computer anyway
2018-11-13 19:58:24	benharri	ok good deal
2018-11-13 19:58:38	benharri	i figured it wasn't malicious
2018-11-13 19:58:47	benharri	glad to find out that it wasn't
2018-11-13 19:59:02	fosslinux	i'll do a blog post too when it comes back
2018-11-13 19:59:08	fosslinux	sorry again
2018-11-13 19:59:13	fosslinux	thanks for sorting that out
2018-11-13 19:59:34	fosslinux	i've gtg now, i'll pop back in an hour or so to see how things are going
2018-11-13 20:00:47	benharri	ok sounds good, thanks for clearing that up
