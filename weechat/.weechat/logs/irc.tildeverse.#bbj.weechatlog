2018-12-15 20:25:52	--	Channel created on Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:38:54
2018-12-15 20:29:50	Bender	[town/desvox] khuxkm|lounge: every one is (key, foreground, background)
2018-12-15 20:29:55	Bender	[town/desvox] so key is the name
2018-12-15 20:30:12	Bender	[town/desvox] and you can see what to set here http://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html
2018-12-15 20:32:04	Bender	[town/desvox] so i define ("bold", "default,bold", "default") and can call urwid.Text(("bold", "Discard current post?")) to give me a text object with foreground "default,bold" and background "default"
2018-12-15 20:32:16	Bender	[town/desvox] might want to read up on urwids docs, just generally speaking
2018-12-15 20:33:07	Bender	[town/desvox] also the channel is only dead because nobody has anything to say, if filing issues and using this channel hasnt worked, then theres just not much interest in it
2018-12-15 20:33:16	Bender	[town/desvox] and moving somewhere else wont help with that
2018-12-15 20:47:39	robdrake	any python experts here? Just need someone who can integrate my voting program, when finished, into bbj
2018-12-15 20:48:15	fosslinux	im pretty ok
2018-12-15 20:48:34	robdrake	I need to get off IRC and back to work, bbiaf
2018-12-15 20:48:42	fosslinux	cya
2018-12-15 20:57:45	Bender	[town/desvox] funny you mention polls, that was planned at some point
2018-12-15 21:29:02	robdrake	I asked if there was something I could do to help tilde.team, he said write a voting program
2018-12-15 21:30:43	robdrake	using python so someone _else_ can integrate the program into BBJ
2018-12-15 21:31:01	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-15 21:31:06	fosslinux	i dont know bbj code
2018-12-15 21:31:11	fosslinux	i might read it a bit later
2018-12-15 21:39:08	Bender	[town/desvox] the client is all urwid and i didn't particularly enjoy working with urwid
2018-12-15 21:39:44	Bender	[town/desvox] urwid of course being the ui library, not some other language
2018-12-15 21:39:59	Bender	[town/desvox] so that's messy as hell but yeah you can read it
2018-12-15 23:15:18	robdrake	Sorry progress is slow, I sit in the wheelchair, I don't fall asleep due to tailbone pain, and if I'm in bed, I doze off, but my tailbone doesn't hurt
2018-12-15 23:37:31	~ben	oof lose-lose situation there
2018-12-16 00:00:55	robdrake	yeah, kind of
2018-12-16 00:01:19	robdrake	but... If I do doze off, I can make up the time tonight
2018-12-16 00:07:55	cmccabe	robdrake: how did you get injured?
2018-12-16 00:10:18	~ben	there's no time requirement; no worries
2018-12-16 00:37:55	robdrake	cmccabe: Winters of 2000, 2001, 2002, slipped on ice, fell straight down onto the sidewalk, tailbone first
2018-12-16 00:38:16	robdrake	once hard enough to split a clip board in my backpack
2018-12-16 00:39:57	robdrake	it's still my project, pull requests rejected, but what I have so far: https://tildegit.org/rgdrake/vote_program.git
2018-12-16 00:40:21	robdrake	looking for comments on the questions.json format in src
2018-12-16 01:28:05	robdrake	someone wants to take over the python branch, pushes to master, for now, welcome, I've made a node branch that is the current branch I'm working on. I should move master to python I guess
2018-12-16 01:29:32	robdrake	anyone still awake?
2018-12-16 01:34:18	fosslinux	yesss
2018-12-16 02:01:38	~ben	i'm not awake
2018-12-16 02:26:25	robdrake	oh
