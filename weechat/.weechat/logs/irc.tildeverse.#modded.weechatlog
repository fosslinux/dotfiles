2018-12-01 05:40:12	fosslinux	very nice looking
2018-12-01 05:41:14	fosslinux	and also from what i've heard it's preferable to use oracle for performance
2018-12-01 05:41:19	fosslinux	but that's closed source
2018-12-01 05:44:35	ben	just be considerate of the disk usage
2018-12-01 05:44:48	fosslinux	?
2018-12-01 05:46:45	~khuxkm	sdkman dir is 248MB

2018-12-01 05:48:30	~khuxkm	and the server should be online soon
2018-12-01 05:48:39	~khuxkm	fosslinux: what's your username
2018-12-01 05:49:18	~khuxkm	so my goal is to possibly add ae2 to futuro tecnico before the modded server goes public
2018-12-01 05:49:28	fosslinux	khuxkm: ParkCrafters on mc
2018-12-01 05:49:48	fosslinux	i haven't been on the server yet
2018-12-01 05:49:51	fosslinux	is the server working?
2018-12-01 05:49:58	~khuxkm	it's whitelisted (I have to add you
2018-12-01 05:51:12	~khuxkm	fosslinux: you're whitelisted
2018-12-01 05:55:24	sose	So khuxkm are you starting the server back up?
2018-12-01 05:56:27	~khuxkm	yeah
2018-12-01 05:56:34	~khuxkm	but tildepack is cool
2018-12-01 05:56:45	~khuxkm	plus you can never have too many modded servers :P
2018-12-01 05:57:24	sose	I mean I only made the new one cuz  I thought the old one was gonna stay down
2018-12-01 05:57:42	~khuxkm	i guess the point of futuro tecnico is a modpack based on "not gonna rape your comp but gonna give you some computing fun" and this server is a bit of a hobby project around that
2018-12-01 05:57:59	~khuxkm	and tildepack is also not gonna destroy the computer but it's a bit cozier
2018-12-01 05:58:13	~khuxkm	idk I'm tired and I don't make sense when tired
2018-12-01 05:58:24	fosslinux	go to bed
2018-12-01 05:58:28	sose	Nah I see
2018-12-01 05:58:34	sose	Maybe I could do the opposite

2018-12-01 06:02:21	~khuxkm	tilde.team:65535
2018-12-01 06:03:13	fosslinux	why not modded.tilde.team?
2018-12-01 06:03:31	ben	i mean that still resolves to the same ip
2018-12-01 06:04:09	~khuxkm|lounge	yeah
2018-12-01 06:04:13	~khuxkm|lounge	I'm on btw
2018-12-01 06:04:49	ben	hi, on btw, i'm ben
2018-12-01 06:07:22	~khuxkm	so officially, I'm considering vetoing Applied Energistics, since my comp can barely run the mods we have at 30 fps with minimal settings
2018-12-01 06:07:34	fosslinux	lmao
2018-12-01 06:07:50	sose	Aww :(
2018-12-01 06:08:16	sose	I would suggest mekanism, but thats pretty heavy too
2018-12-01 06:08:19	fosslinux	khuxkm: computer specs?
2018-12-01 06:08:24	sose	Do you have optifine?
2018-12-01 06:08:26	fosslinux	mekanism is gr888
2018-12-01 06:08:28	fosslinux	^
2018-12-01 06:08:32	sose	Fs include it in the pack
2018-12-01 06:08:40	~khuxkm	Dell Chromebook 11 3180
2018-12-01 06:08:44	sose	Well
2018-12-01 06:08:57	~khuxkm	(it runs vanilla at 60FPS stop laughing at me :P)
2018-12-01 06:08:59	fosslinux	well its a chromebook what do you expect
2018-12-01 06:09:11	~khuxkm	IT RUNS VANILLA AT 60 FPS
2018-12-01 06:09:20	sose	But optifine or nah?
2018-12-01 06:09:23	~khuxkm	I EXPECT 30FPS OUT OF IT AT THE SAME SETTINGS
2018-12-01 06:09:33	~khuxkm	i should probably add optifine tbh
2018-12-01 06:09:35	fosslinux	YOU'RE RUNNING HEAVY MODS
2018-12-01 06:09:40	~khuxkm	what heavy mods
2018-12-01 06:09:42	sose	is he tho?
2018-12-01 06:09:44	sose	Yea
2018-12-01 06:10:02	~khuxkm|lounge	4 fuccin mods https://khuxkm.tilde.team/ftmodpack/modlist.php
2018-12-01 06:10:06	~khuxkm|lounge	it's small af
2018-12-01 06:10:11	~khuxkm|lounge	that's what it's all about :P
2018-12-01 06:10:18	fosslinux	like applied energistics is big
2018-12-01 06:10:32	~khuxkm	i would appreciate if someone else would log on btw
2018-12-01 06:10:32	sose	Thats not in the pack
2018-12-01 06:10:38	fosslinux	oh
2018-12-01 06:10:46	~khuxkm	yeah
2018-12-01 06:10:47	fosslinux	i can't rn khuxkm
2018-12-01 06:10:57	~khuxkm	w/o ae2 I barely get 30FPS
2018-12-01 06:10:59	fosslinux	forge lags it by itself tbh
2018-12-01 06:11:04	~khuxkm	still
2018-12-01 06:11:09	sose	Seriously try optifine tho, even if it isnt in the pack
2018-12-01 06:11:11	~khuxkm	30FPS is a lot of lag
2018-12-01 06:11:25	~khuxkm	I'm going to probably cave and just add optifine to the pack
2018-12-01 06:11:30	~khuxkm	but in the meantime
2018-12-01 06:11:32	sose	And on a chromebook? That isn't too bad
2018-12-01 06:11:41	~khuxkm	I'm gonna work on some things
2018-12-01 06:12:10	~khuxkm	maybe the modded server's homepage could be on modded.tilde.team/modded.tildeverse.org? haven't decided :P
2018-12-01 06:12:28	sose	Probably tildeverse
2018-12-01 06:12:33	sose	The vanilla one is
2018-12-01 06:14:08	~khuxkm	aight
