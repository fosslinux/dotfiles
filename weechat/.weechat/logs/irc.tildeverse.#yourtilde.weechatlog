2018-11-17 01:17:50	mushmouth	i just don't have my own professional looking server for that
2018-11-17 01:18:33	~deepend	i know very little about cvs :D  
2018-11-17 01:19:23	mushmouth	you would just need cvs and cvs web from freebsd i believe

2018-11-17 01:21:54	mushmouth	i just don't like git
2018-11-17 01:28:28	~deepend	I will definately look into it.. I have been tempted in the past but I personally have no use for cvs :) 
2018-11-17 01:53:58	mushmouth	deepend: can i make that tempt actually do it? :P

2018-11-19 18:11:35	@ubergeek	Oh yeah, I caught that one.  Odd it was kicked for running a basic 80/443 scan
2018-11-19 18:11:46	@ubergeek	I do that often from my digital ocean account, for legit purposes
2018-11-19 18:11:59	mushmouth	yeah i think the guy was doing it for legit purposes too
2018-11-19 18:12:03	mushmouth	nothing sketchy
2018-11-19 18:14:22	mushmouth	so ben is getting a nother node in case this one goes down

2018-11-19 18:33:02	@ubergeek	I heard something about thunix.  Never inquired more though
2018-11-19 18:42:15	ben	apparently the admin just shut the machine down
2018-11-19 18:42:22	ben	(he was hosting from home)
2018-11-19 18:44:41	@ubergeek	oh
2018-11-19 18:44:49	@ubergeek	well, that sucks.  Any reason given?
2018-11-19 18:55:27	mushmouth	ubergeek: how your new doggo been?
2018-11-19 19:05:05	@ubergeek	She's made herself right at home.  ANd, she finally found her bark
2018-11-19 19:11:43	ben	not that i know of
2018-11-19 19:24:00	mushmouth	ubergeek: cause you have another doggo right? how they getting along
2018-11-19 19:29:41	@ubergeek	yeah, all 4 of them are getting along pretty well.  A few spats here and there, but nothing a sharp "No" doesn't stop
2018-11-19 19:30:03	@ubergeek	It's hilarious to see the beagle and doxie wrestling, though.  The beagle pretends to be losing, often.
2018-11-19 19:31:39	mushmouth	ubergeek: we finally surrneder our dog. he just wasn't working well with us. hopefully he in a better new home
2018-11-19 19:32:59	mushmouth	mom is thinking of getting fishes

2018-11-19 21:17:32	@TildeBot	sr.ht - software hosting for hackers 
2018-11-19 21:17:36	mushmouth	this is what we got setup
2018-11-19 21:17:40	mushmouth	or trying too
2018-11-19 21:18:08	sebboh-yt	mushmouth: yeah I got an account on there.  
2018-11-19 21:18:58	mushmouth	sebboh-yt: i think it better then all the other gnu software
2018-11-19 21:19:02	mushmouth	imo
2018-11-19 21:19:13	ben	sr.ht is a dope project
2018-11-19 21:19:32	mushmouth	ben: maybe you can get deepend to setup the git for our public_git folders?
2018-11-19 21:19:47	ben	hm?
2018-11-19 21:20:00	ben	a la git.sr.ht?
2018-11-19 21:20:02	mushmouth	you know the git.sr.ht and how we have our own git servers
2018-11-19 21:20:05	mushmouth	yes
2018-11-19 21:20:14	ben	oh idk if it's meant for that
2018-11-19 21:20:19	amcclure	deepend: do you know why trying to load my site from your~ just downloaded a file called "~amcclure.man"
2018-11-19 21:21:53	mushmouth	amcclure: does it still have that menu when you try to ssh into this box?
2018-11-19 21:22:33	mushmouth	that what i want to think it is
2018-11-19 21:22:35	mushmouth	but i think im wrong
2018-11-19 21:22:51	sebboh-yt	have you all looked into how sr.ht is meant to be deployed?  I think plenty of work was put into making it all devops-provisioning-shard-scale style, if you know what I mean.  I could be wrong!
2018-11-19 21:22:55	ben	check you ~/public_html to be sure
2018-11-19 21:23:09	ben	sebboh-yt: i've been trying to get it deployed on a vps at nand.pub
2018-11-19 21:23:19	mushmouth	sebboh-yt: i think it a better alternative to a lot of stuff we have avaible to us right now
2018-11-19 21:23:22	ben	/join #sr.ht here for updates
2018-11-19 21:23:35	ben	not sure how much value it will provide since we already have tildegit.org
2018-11-19 21:23:54	ben	but sircmpwn encouraged it after i mentioned i run ~team
2018-11-19 21:23:56	mushmouth	ben: i think it'll use less resources
2018-11-19 21:23:59	ben	than?
2018-11-19 21:24:00	mushmouth	so it makes me happy at least
2018-11-19 21:24:04	mushmouth	the git we have now
2018-11-19 21:24:07	ben	lol no way
2018-11-19 21:24:12	ben	gitea is super lightweight
2018-11-19 21:24:24	mushmouth	by the way we have snow and ice already :(
2018-11-19 21:24:32	mushmouth	i hate the sound of snow
2018-11-19 21:24:33	ben	we've had that for like 2 weeks now :(
2018-11-19 21:24:43	mushmouth	i hate walking on snow
2018-11-19 21:24:45	mushmouth	it bugs me
2018-11-19 21:24:47	amcclure	Which would be better to use between yourtilde.com/git and tildegit.org
2018-11-19 21:24:57	mushmouth	amcclure: what your persoanl preference is
2018-11-19 21:25:01	mushmouth	i like yourtilde better
2018-11-19 21:25:50	amcclure	is there anything that makes it different?
2018-11-19 21:25:56	ben	yourtilde is just a read-only repo viewer
2018-11-19 21:26:11	ben	tildegit.org is a full-fledged git hosting service
2018-11-19 21:26:23	ben	full api, forks, PRs, etc
2018-11-19 21:26:31	mushmouth	i only need read only
2018-11-19 21:26:42	mushmouth	i don't like a lot of extra stuff that tildegit has
2018-11-19 21:26:48	ben	you don't have to use it
2018-11-19 21:26:58	mushmouth	it not the same thing
2018-11-19 21:26:58	ben	i like having issues and PRs
2018-11-19 21:27:08	mushmouth	you get me buddy?
2018-11-19 21:27:09	ben	issues are a nice todo list for me
2018-11-19 21:27:14	sebboh-yt	sr.ht doesn't have PRs.
2018-11-19 21:27:17	mushmouth	i like stuff like cgit
2018-11-19 21:27:28	mushmouth	brb mom here
2018-11-19 21:27:32	mushmouth	from work
2018-11-19 21:27:33	ben	great, i'm just saying that a read-only view isn't enough for me
2018-11-19 21:27:42	ben	sr.ht has an alternative to PRs in the form of mailing lists
2018-11-19 21:27:47	sebboh-yt	well, it has PR-via-email, you know, like linux kernel development...
2018-11-19 21:27:52	ben	and git-send-email(1)
2018-11-19 21:27:55	sebboh-yt	right
2018-11-19 21:28:03	ben	cgit has none of these things
2018-11-19 21:28:18	amcclure	I had plans on having a git service for thunix
2018-11-19 21:29:24	ben	gitlab or somethign?

2018-11-20 06:41:26	~deepend	amcclure: git wise I use tildegit for most things. but generally keep a local copy for myself on yourtilde.com as well. 
2018-11-20 06:41:34	~deepend	mushmouth: your webpage is loading fine for me? 
2018-11-20 06:49:18	fosslinux	deepend: can you hop on #tilderadio?
2018-11-20 07:20:18	~deepend	fosslinux: the channel?   as for legalities things are fairly lax at the moment.  Will need to get that all sorted out probably sooner then later.
2018-11-20 07:21:02	fosslinux	yes sooner than later
2018-11-20 07:21:06	fosslinux	good idea
2018-11-20 10:46:59	mushmouth	hey deepend 
2018-11-20 10:52:30	mushmouth	deepend: i was talking about the games.
2018-11-20 11:27:20	mushmouth	deepend: you can ship the games to my address without the po box
2018-11-20 11:27:33	mushmouth	i don't believe i'll be able to access the po box or content of it for days
2018-11-20 11:27:40	mushmouth	so it best just to directly ship to my house
2018-11-20 11:28:04	mushmouth	and both cost the same amount

2018-11-21 04:48:14	hyperboredoubt	I think there used to be some way to register Mastodon through tilde, but I assumed it would send messages, not log-in updates.
2018-11-21 04:49:36	~deepend	well there is a mastodon client installed .. still not sure why itd send via some other account.  the message was only supposed to work with the @yourtilde account.. but guess it didn't work as planned :D

2018-11-24 02:07:23	@ubergeek	maybe make it ns2.tilde, and just keep both running
2018-11-24 02:07:31	~deepend	once logged in to the paste website.. you find the paste and click on it.. then scroll down and there will be an edit box at the bottom
2018-11-24 02:07:50	mushmouth	oh yeah i have a win xp machine which uses netscape 4.04 as a gopher client
2018-11-24 02:08:10	mushmouth	palemoon/kemelon and seamonkey
2018-11-24 02:08:12	~deepend	that'd be a good idea.. even mine isn't fast enough but its a bit faster then using one from germany :P 
2018-11-24 02:08:27	@ubergeek	For a DNS server, doesn't need to be too fast.
2018-11-24 02:08:34	@ubergeek	It's like hosting a gopher server, really.
2018-11-24 02:08:36	@ubergeek	Low resources
2018-11-24 02:08:37	mushmouth	ubergeek: just needs to be in a central area
2018-11-24 02:08:51	@ubergeek	mushmouth: the problem is, though, central to whom?
2018-11-24 02:08:52	~deepend	ping wise i mean when I say fast enough :P
2018-11-24 02:08:58	@ubergeek	ah, got ya
2018-11-24 02:09:05	mushmouth	new york when i was running game servers. had pretty good ping
2018-11-24 02:09:19	mushmouth	but if your talking europe they will always get 100+
2018-11-24 02:09:44	~deepend	well europe would be good if you plan to have users that are in that area.. 
2018-11-24 02:09:50	@ubergeek	yeah, 125ms for my server, from me
2018-11-24 02:10:37	~deepend	would be nice to get one in north west side of the US or west side of canada.. probably would speed things up for me. but not the end of the world.. I've been using the dns i setup since I set it up and its not to bad
2018-11-24 02:10:45	@ubergeek	NY is great ping time to US residents.  I wonder how many tilders are NOT in the western hemisphere?
2018-11-24 02:10:58	mushmouth	i know of jan6 and sev
2018-11-24 02:11:09	mushmouth	jan6 from ee
2018-11-24 02:11:11	mushmouth	sev from cz
2018-11-24 02:11:19	~deepend	mushmouth probably gets good ping to my dns server lol 
2018-11-24 02:11:34	mushmouth	if it wouldn't ban me for miss typing a password 1-3 times :P
2018-11-24 02:11:59	~deepend	lol  dns server has nothing to do with that part of my server
2018-11-24 02:12:18	@ubergeek	mushmouth: can you ping 149.56.184.112 and let me know what your avg time is?
2018-11-24 02:12:29	@ubergeek	and also 139.59.215.24
2018-11-24 02:12:33	@ubergeek	*If you don't mind
2018-11-24 02:12:37	mushmouth	ubergeek: like just normal ping?
2018-11-24 02:12:40	@ubergeek	yeah
2018-11-24 02:13:06	~deepend	59ms to mine for me.. 151ms to yours :) 
2018-11-24 02:13:11	~deepend	even tho u didn't ask me :)

2018-11-24 02:14:08	mushmouth	first one closer
2018-11-24 02:14:09	@ubergeek	Yeah, I might kill that Frankfurt server, and move it to NYC
2018-11-24 02:14:47	@ubergeek	I honestly don't believe we have too many non-Western Hemi users, and if we do, they should be able to set up a .tilde DNS server themselves, honestly
2018-11-24 02:14:54	mushmouth	im eastern toronto. in rural and on bad lines
2018-11-24 02:15:34	~deepend	digital ocean offers vps in toronto :P 
2018-11-24 02:15:49	@ubergeek	TOR might even be better than NYC
2018-11-24 02:15:52	@ubergeek	hrmm.
2018-11-24 02:16:08	@ubergeek	TOR gets me out of a 5 eyes country
2018-11-24 02:16:16	~deepend	toronto would be simular to mine
2018-11-24 02:16:26	@ubergeek	Is yours in TOR deepend ?
2018-11-24 02:16:32	@ubergeek	If so, wouldn't want it there
2018-11-24 02:16:41	~deepend	quebec canada.
2018-11-24 02:16:51	@ubergeek	oh, that's far enough away
2018-11-24 02:17:03	 *	ubergeek prefers these kinds of things at least 100 miles apart
2018-11-24 02:17:24	~deepend	what side of the country are you on again? 
2018-11-24 02:18:12	@ubergeek	I'm in NYS

2018-11-24 02:33:10	~deepend	gonna toss up a droplet on digital ocean in san francisco.. see if that is any better for the west side of the world lol
2018-11-24 02:33:47	@ubergeek	Now that you mention, it would be better to put it further west.
2018-11-24 02:33:53	@ubergeek	San Fran or Denver(?)
2018-11-24 02:34:15	~deepend	san fran is simular ping to me.. 159.89.149.187  ping this one and see what you guys get
2018-11-24 02:35:30	~deepend	^^ server in san fran

2018-11-24 02:40:05	~deepend	i was hoping my ping was better.. but i'm still in the 50s  lol .. whats in the middle of the US that has a digital ocean datacenter or vultr? LOL
2018-11-24 02:40:31	@ubergeek	lemme check DO's DCs
2018-11-24 02:40:45	~deepend	i'm on digital ocean.. they dont seem to have alot
2018-11-24 02:41:05	@ubergeek	looks like only NYC and San Fran
2018-11-24 02:41:06	~deepend	gonna login to vultr and see what they have
2018-11-24 02:41:14	@ubergeek	(And TOR)
2018-11-24 02:41:30	~deepend	TOR would be simular for me to san fran and my own server
2018-11-24 02:41:53	@ubergeek	I can put all of the ns's in DO behind a load balancer :P
2018-11-24 02:42:14	~deepend	vultr has seattle.. which if i remember was a bit better.. they even have chicago
2018-11-24 02:42:39	~deepend	i'll deploy one in seattle and chicago and see what the pings are
2018-11-24 02:42:55	@ubergeek	I put together a wiki page on how to deploy:
2018-11-24 02:43:12	@ubergeek	https://tildegit.org/ubergeek/.tilde/wiki/Setting-up-a-.tilde-DNS-server
2018-11-24 02:43:24	@ubergeek	It should be replicable
2018-11-24 02:43:51	~deepend	very nice :) 
2018-11-24 02:48:58	~deepend	Average = 27ms  is my seattle one
2018-11-24 02:49:07	~deepend	66.42.77.29   ping this one
2018-11-24 02:49:31	@ubergeek	nice
2018-11-24 02:49:51	@ubergeek	84ms
2018-11-24 02:50:39	~deepend	you had less to san fran.. nuts lol
2018-11-24 02:50:46	slipyx	130
2018-11-24 02:51:06	~deepend	must of just had a really good route to san fran 
2018-11-24 02:51:16	@ubergeek	that too.  I'm pinging from spectrum
2018-11-24 02:51:20	@ubergeek	... over wifi
2018-11-24 02:51:54	~deepend	ah wifi will add a bit.. but not too much in theory
2018-11-24 02:52:02	~deepend	130 slipyx .. where are you at?
2018-11-24 02:52:57	slipyx	PA
2018-11-24 02:53:22	@ubergeek	To put it in perspective quad 8 pings at 28ms
2018-11-24 02:53:39	@ubergeek	quad 9 is 66 ms
2018-11-24 02:54:18	@ubergeek	I don't think we'll ever get to quad 8 reply times.  And, nobody seems to be much worse than quad 9
2018-11-24 02:55:19	@ubergeek	fwiw, I added locations to the .tilde NS list:
2018-11-24 02:55:24	@ubergeek	https://tildegit.org/ubergeek/.tilde/wiki/NS-List
2018-11-24 02:55:42	~deepend	need to add mkdir /etc/bind  since centos doesn't normally have that folder.. and need to have cd into the tilde folder that your instructions cloned to the server
2018-11-24 02:55:44	@ubergeek	(And made it a table)
2018-11-24 02:56:06	@ubergeek	lemme fix that deepend 
2018-11-24 02:56:37	~deepend	going to leave the seattle one spun up
2018-11-24 02:57:05	@ubergeek	fixed
2018-11-24 02:57:25	@ubergeek	that's the 66 server?
2018-11-24 02:58:01	~deepend	and the configs that are on git are still only allowing use from localhost
2018-11-24 02:58:13	@ubergeek	What do you mean?
2018-11-24 02:58:21	~deepend	        listen-on port 53 { any; };
2018-11-24 02:58:23	~deepend	        listen-on-v6 port 53 { any; };
2018-11-24 02:58:25	~deepend	        directory       "/var/named";
2018-11-24 02:58:27	~deepend	        dump-file       "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db";
2018-11-24 02:58:29	~deepend	        statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt";
2018-11-24 02:58:31	~deepend	        memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt";
2018-11-24 02:58:33	~deepend	        allow-query     { any; };
2018-11-24 02:58:35	~deepend	all were localhost
2018-11-24 02:58:43	~deepend	so nobody would have been able to use the dns outside of the server itself
2018-11-24 02:58:56	@ubergeek	what file it that?
2018-11-24 02:59:14	~deepend	named.conf
2018-11-24 02:59:26	@ubergeek	ah, ok.  There's no named.conf in the git repo
2018-11-24 02:59:27	~deepend	or does that not sync
2018-11-24 02:59:43	@ubergeek	It's a centos specific file (Well, not debian)
2018-11-24 02:59:51	~deepend	ok.. maybe should be.. probably need one for centos and one for ubuntu due to differences im sure
2018-11-24 02:59:57	@ubergeek	There *might* need to be two branches.
2018-11-24 03:00:23	@ubergeek	Debian wants you to not modify the installed files, aside from the local ones
2018-11-24 03:00:31	@ubergeek	But CentOS/RHEL is a bit different.
2018-11-24 03:00:37	~deepend	could just have it all in one branch and have the named.conf as part of the cp commands in your instructions?
2018-11-24 03:00:53	@ubergeek	Anywhere in the named.conf file is specific to the host?
2018-11-24 03:01:25	~deepend	not sure if anything is different as far as named.conf.. never ran a debian dns server :P
2018-11-24 03:01:36	@ubergeek	doesn't look so
2018-11-24 03:01:38	~deepend	i know its bind.. but could have more differences
2018-11-24 03:02:12	@ubergeek	so, yeah, looks like we could add it to the git repo, and add a cp command for CentOS/RHEL
2018-11-24 03:02:33	~deepend	hmm.. ok I see. you have it including a named.conf.local.. does that already have other stuff or is that just stuff relating to the zones?
2018-11-24 03:02:43	@ubergeek	That is just the zone stuff
2018-11-24 03:02:50	~deepend	okie just checking.. 
2018-11-24 03:04:29	~deepend	sudo systemctl restart bind9  <-- needs to be named not bind9 :P
2018-11-24 03:04:44	~deepend	for centos
2018-11-24 03:04:55	~deepend	sudo journalctl -xe
2018-11-24 03:05:00	~deepend	oops wrong window
2018-11-24 03:06:17	@ubergeek	danke
2018-11-24 03:06:33	@ubergeek	fixed
2018-11-24 03:06:56	@ubergeek	and added named.conf to the git repo, and wiki'd the cp command
2018-11-24 03:08:07	~deepend	         listen-on-v6 port 53 { any; };    can this be added to the named.conf ?  sorry id do it myself except I'm just not that quick with git lol
2018-11-24 03:08:58	@ubergeek	added
2018-11-24 03:12:15	~deepend	if this is for anyone to join in then we probably should add information or maybe a requirement of some sort of basic server hardening.. like basic firewall / no password auth.. but thats just my opinion.. 
2018-11-24 03:12:35	@ubergeek	not a bad idea...
2018-11-24 03:13:21	@ubergeek	let me know when the new server is ready, and I'll test it out
2018-11-24 03:14:11	~deepend	almost
2018-11-24 03:15:54	~deepend	query-source port 53;   maybe have this in the named.conf... since i prefer to tighen the firewall down.. and without that i'd have to leave the firewall wide open
2018-11-24 03:17:08	@ubergeek	It's already in named.conf
2018-11-24 03:17:16	@ubergeek	line #16
2018-11-24 03:17:18	~deepend	oh ok.. just checking. I didn't even look sorry lol
2018-11-24 03:17:24	@ubergeek	no problem.
2018-11-24 03:17:24	@TildeBot	no u infinity ubergeek
2018-11-24 03:17:32	~deepend	lol
2018-11-24 03:17:36	@ubergeek	I consider this a trial-by-fire of the docs
2018-11-24 03:17:56	@ubergeek	If we nail every spot for CentOS/RHEL, we can consider that a valid documentation
2018-11-24 03:17:59	~deepend	sounds good to me.. thats how tilde type stuff runs doesn't it.. its all trial by fire :P
2018-11-24 03:18:04	@ubergeek	:D
2018-11-24 03:19:28	~deepend	ok try dns in seattle.. in theory it'll work
2018-11-24 03:24:39	@ubergeek	Looks like it's working

2018-11-24 18:40:27	mushmouth	and i might of sold her on mario party
2018-11-24 18:41:09	~deepend	very nice.. i've never really enjoyed mario party.. but most people seem to like it.. I'm more for classic mario games. like Super Mario Bros 1 2 and 3
2018-11-24 18:43:57	mushmouth	well it more of a family friendly system deepend 
2018-11-24 18:46:22	mushmouth	then say sony which i have

2018-11-24 19:49:24	jan6	also ipv6 loopback addresses look so slick
2018-11-24 19:49:34	mushmouth	they look ugly
2018-11-24 19:51:14	~deepend	i think I should get off my ass and setup ipv6 on my servers.. but not sure if ovh allows me to split the /64 into multiple vms or if they only allow for it to goto one system at a time.. I've had 0 luck in past trying to do just that
2018-11-24 19:51:31	mushmouth	try and ask
2018-11-24 19:51:44	mushmouth	but pls no ipv6 only addresses
2018-11-24 19:52:09	~deepend	too soon in the world to only offer ipv6.. ipv4 is still waht most people rely on 
2018-11-24 19:52:24	mushmouth	that what going to scare me

2018-11-24 19:56:14	mushmouth	their reasoning is because their not the same company
2018-11-24 19:56:23	mushmouth	they don't want to be seen as cook zero or cook light
2018-11-24 19:56:25	~deepend	i have a The SSL Store reseller account lol

2018-11-24 20:04:40	~deepend	apparently had 20 more backups then I wanted to keep.. lol  I really should fix my cron that automatically purges the extras. 
2018-11-24 20:05:03	mushmouth	show us your firewall and cron settings please deepend :P
2018-11-24 20:05:35	jan6	the question was @ deepend this time, why'd you have a reseller account?
2018-11-24 20:06:13	~deepend	used to sell hosting awhile back.. is why I have a reseller with the ssl store and enom.
2018-11-24 20:06:40	~deepend	enom used to be a decent deal a few years back.. but its really not even in competition anymore.. sad
2018-11-24 20:06:57	jan6	why'd you stop? also are you gonna sell stuff cheap to tilderers at reseller price? ;P
2018-11-24 20:07:00	edwardthefma	Grr
2018-11-24 20:07:13	mushmouth	jan6: yeah he would if you have the domain
2018-11-24 20:07:18	mushmouth	but the domain is not a reasonable price
2018-11-24 20:07:20	jan6	grr @ what, edwardthefma?
2018-11-24 20:07:22	mushmouth	compared to like others
2018-11-24 20:07:39	jan6	what domain is not reasonable?
2018-11-24 20:07:40	~deepend	not selling anything.. lol  I could offer reseller accounts from enom if anyone wanted one. but thats the extent of that at this point
2018-11-24 20:07:43	edwardthefma	How in the hell can I get wechat in the background
2018-11-24 20:08:01	mushmouth	tmux
2018-11-24 20:08:03	jan6	you use byobu/tmux/screen
2018-11-24 20:08:20	jan6	~team has byobu for new accounts by default, I think
2018-11-24 20:08:25	edwardthefma	Yourtilde server
2018-11-24 20:08:35	ben	byobu++
2018-11-24 20:08:38	~deepend	i'm moving my domains slowly to namesilo.. is better prices then I can get with enom *even at enoms highest reseller package*
2018-11-24 20:08:42	mushmouth	byobu-enable on deepend too
2018-11-24 20:08:52	jan6	but generally just google for a tutorial on any of the three
2018-11-24 20:09:06	~deepend	byobu is what I use at this point.. never used to before.
2018-11-24 20:09:10	jan6	I personally use screen, cause it works, and doesn't have that annoying bar
2018-11-24 20:09:10	ben	byobu doesn't even really need a tutorial
2018-11-24 20:09:14	ben	just do shift-f1
2018-11-24 20:09:16	ben	annoying bar?
2018-11-24 20:09:23	ben	i don't get any annoying bars
2018-11-24 20:09:25	jan6	tmux's bar
2018-11-24 20:09:35	ben	i get the nice status one in byobu
2018-11-24 20:09:37	~deepend	shift f1 depending on what your using for a terminal.. shift f1 does nothing on mine
2018-11-24 20:09:43	edwardthefma	This kid better be happy

2018-11-24 20:14:35	mushmouth	and probably till midlow pisses off or something
2018-11-24 20:15:39	jan6	still, afaik the bot revenge kicks and stuff, but not before you kick or ban it first?
2018-11-24 20:15:39	~deepend	because TildeBot is not just a annoying spammer. 
2018-11-24 20:15:40	@TildeBot	deepend, Knows jan6 is my favourite because i am a human being, which i'll do page modifications for it a bit annoying.

2018-11-24 20:18:22	mushmouth	im tempted to turn one of my xp machiens into a 95 or 98 one
2018-11-24 20:18:26	mushmouth	since it has a pentium
2018-11-24 20:18:50	mushmouth	just need to figure out the drivers
2018-11-24 20:18:57	mushmouth	and which one i could go down too
2018-11-24 20:20:15	jan6	put win3.1 on your dos machines :P
2018-11-24 20:20:44	mushmouth	i have dos 6.2 on one and need to install 3.1 onto it
2018-11-24 20:21:29	mushmouth	i messed up deepend version of it
2018-11-24 20:24:20	mushmouth	hey ben do you think mirc would run on here?
2018-11-24 20:24:38	mushmouth	im looking at getting a older ver for win xp
2018-11-24 20:24:42	mushmouth	to keep the theme
2018-11-24 20:25:15	~deepend	mirc works on almost any version of windows
2018-11-24 20:25:24	~deepend	i'm leaving for real now.. bbl :) 
2018-11-24 20:25:29	mushmouth	deepend: which ver has the most classical look?
2018-11-24 20:25:46	~deepend	mirc has changed almost not at all over the years
2018-11-24 20:26:49	~deepend	https://www.mirc.com/get.php?version=635   I think will work downto windows 95 or so if i remember correctly.. if not you can get older from places like oldversion.com
2018-11-24 20:27:15	~deepend	but for xp the current version will work just fine
2018-11-24 20:28:06	~deepend	only thing older versions don't have that i've noticed outside of security fixes are lack of ssl support.. or atleast ssl support that functions on the current web
2018-11-24 20:30:08	jan6	to that, you can probably proxy the irc through localhost
2018-11-24 20:30:41	jan6	ssh port forward to the machine, the mirc on the forwarded port, or something
2018-11-24 20:31:57	jan6	I'd assume putty probably works on old windows's too, if not, whatever, you probably have a linux box on the network anyway
2018-11-24 20:33:12	jan6	(putty IS definitely a pain to get working with ssh keys, a big pain, but it's basically the only windows ssh solution I know that doesn't involve basically installing an entire linux-like system)

2018-11-24 20:56:18	mushmouth	fair enough
2018-11-24 20:56:56	jan6	just sayin' that there's no troubles with relays using it...
2018-11-24 20:57:11	edwardthefma	Also if it messes up he can fix it on his own
2018-11-24 20:57:44	jan6	you sure about that?
2018-11-24 20:58:03	edwardthefma	He isn't that dumb
2018-11-24 20:58:19	edwardthefma	I give the kid some credit

2018-11-24 23:07:02	mushmouth	it was hard to make one
2018-11-24 23:07:08	mushmouth	now it just a simply script
2018-11-24 23:12:14	edwardthefma	I had a php script for my mmo
2018-11-24 23:12:50	edwardthefma	It told me everyone'
2018-11-24 23:14:13	edwardthefma	Everyone's data on all accounts what skills they used and whare they we're in the game
2018-11-24 23:14:50	edwardthefma	I could see what armor they were wharing
2018-11-24 23:24:46	mushmouth	was it like one of those text based mmos?
2018-11-24 23:34:51	edwardthefma	It was a 2d mmo with 16 bit carictors
2018-11-24 23:38:47	mushmouth	2d mmos are fun
2018-11-24 23:38:53	mushmouth	kind of like maplestory yeah?

2018-11-24 23:50:38	mushmouth	you think so?
2018-11-24 23:51:14	edwardthefma	Yes its a good game engine for beginners

2018-11-25 00:00:04	mushmouth	okay so it cost some money to get final version and extra stuff

2018-11-25 01:35:52	mushmouth	i only really watch retro anime
2018-11-25 01:35:59	fosslinux	wth
2018-11-25 01:36:07	fosslinux	is retro anime
2018-11-25 01:36:13	mushmouth	like 90s
2018-11-25 01:36:19	mushmouth	90s anime
2018-11-25 01:36:45	fosslinux	umm
2018-11-25 01:36:46	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-25 01:37:27	edwardthefma	Watch goblen slayer
2018-11-25 01:37:29	mushmouth	and around 00's for me
2018-11-25 01:45:23	ubergeek|lounge	So, Vampire Hunter D?  Robotron?
2018-11-25 01:45:40	ubergeek|lounge	Although robotron is like early 80s
2018-11-25 01:45:47	mushmouth	inuyasha and stuff like that
2018-11-25 01:45:59	mushmouth	i got started on inuyasha and earlier pokemon
2018-11-25 01:46:12	mushmouth	and yugioh
2018-11-25 01:46:51	ubergeek|lounge	Not to big into anime as an interest, but I do like some anime shows.  Eva is probably my favorite, with robotron close behind
2018-11-25 01:47:18	mushmouth	im an otaku. which is called geek in japan. i don't like the weeb name
2018-11-25 01:47:57	mushmouth	i would be more of a otaku retro person
2018-11-25 01:48:02	mushmouth	otaku retro/technology
2018-11-25 01:48:57	mushmouth	a lot of westerners get the whole otaku name wrong
2018-11-25 01:52:50	ubergeek|lounge	Would make sense, since it's not our language lol
2018-11-25 01:53:18	mushmouth	i mean i was born in english but i understand and get more japanese often
2018-11-25 01:53:25	mushmouth	english country
2018-11-25 01:54:33	mushmouth	it makes a lot more sense to me. their culture
2018-11-25 01:56:05	ubergeek|lounge	Face culture confuses me
2018-11-25 01:56:19	ubergeek|lounge	I'd rather be direct and to the point.
2018-11-25 01:57:04	mushmouth	norway is pretty much like that
2018-11-25 01:57:16	mushmouth	at least from norwegians i talked too
2018-11-25 01:59:36	mushmouth	i think this year or next year im going to get my ham radio license
2018-11-25 01:59:48	mushmouth	when i first heard about it on irc's and bbs's
2018-11-25 01:59:55	mushmouth	i think i got more interested in it
2018-11-25 02:02:58	ubergeek|lounge	You should.  But, it's an expensive hobby
2018-11-25 02:03:06	ubergeek|lounge	Or rather, it can be one.
2018-11-25 02:03:12	mushmouth	all my hobbies are expensive so it will fit int
2018-11-25 02:05:31	mushmouth	i still plan to get a snes/nes/gamecube and ps2
2018-11-25 02:07:57	ubergeek|lounge	Yeah retro gaming is rather expensive
2018-11-25 02:08:23	ubergeek|lounge	For example, one of my radios ran me $800 and some change
2018-11-25 02:08:23	mushmouth	i have my n64 now and some games for it
2018-11-25 02:08:33	mushmouth	i would love to mess with that
2018-11-25 02:08:46	ubergeek|lounge	Speaking of which, I need to renew my license this year
2018-11-25 02:09:00	mushmouth	yeah your guys licenses are worse then ours
2018-11-25 02:09:06	mushmouth	we just have to do it one time
2018-11-25 02:09:16	ubergeek|lounge	They're not bad.  Every 10 years, and free renewal
2018-11-25 02:09:31	mushmouth	i don't think we have to renew them in canada
2018-11-25 02:09:38	ubergeek|lounge	I think it's because the call sign pool runs thin
2018-11-25 02:10:11	mushmouth	if i do get my ham license can you recommend me some equipment to get?
2018-11-25 02:10:20	ubergeek|lounge	Yeah, Canadian licenses are lifetime

2018-11-25 02:20:11	fosslinux	and i had my first interaction w/ him today
2018-11-25 02:20:22	ubergeek|lounge	I wrote it off to him being a young teenager
2018-11-25 02:20:34	fosslinux	:PPPPPPP
2018-11-25 02:20:38	fosslinux	don't dis teenagers
2018-11-25 02:20:41	fosslinux	i'm a teenager
2018-11-25 02:20:47	mushmouth	ubergeek|lounge: i was a little more edgier in my wording
2018-11-25 02:20:53	mushmouth	saying the "R" word
2018-11-25 02:21:05	ubergeek|lounge	And I wouldn't know from how you act, which is how it should be :)

2018-11-25 02:23:14	mushmouth	you can have one interaction with him and be like "okay that what that person is like"
2018-11-25 02:23:45	fosslinux	my brain is having a few thinking issues today
2018-11-25 02:24:03	fosslinux	i was just thinking why can i read /etc/passwd as non root
2018-11-25 02:24:06	fosslinux	duh
2018-11-25 02:24:12	 *	fosslinux bangs head
2018-11-25 02:24:31	mushmouth	whats worse is what systemd is trying to manage networking
2018-11-25 02:24:40	mushmouth	netplan?
2018-11-25 02:24:44	fosslinux	systemd
2018-11-25 02:24:45	mushmouth	i think is what it called
2018-11-25 02:24:46	fosslinux	trying
2018-11-25 02:24:47	fosslinux	to
2018-11-25 02:24:50	fosslinux	manage networking
2018-11-25 02:24:51	fosslinux	WTF
2018-11-25 02:25:10	mushmouth	yeah they are trying to mess with something simple like dns servers
2018-11-25 02:25:25	fosslinux	oh yeah
2018-11-25 02:25:28	fosslinux	it does that
2018-11-25 02:25:31	mushmouth	https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-set-dns-nameservers-in-ubuntu-server-18-04/

2018-11-25 02:25:37	mushmouth	try to read this
2018-11-25 02:25:44	mushmouth	and think how systemd logic is sane
2018-11-25 02:25:55	fosslinux	i need to move to devuan
2018-11-25 02:26:15	mushmouth	i thought ubuntu would of still sticked with a more legacy style base
2018-11-25 02:26:16	mushmouth	but nope
2018-11-25 02:26:29	mushmouth	cause i was having fps issues playing clone hero on devuan
2018-11-25 02:27:07	mushmouth	clone hero is a pc port of guitar hero. with custom songs etc
2018-11-25 02:27:13	mushmouth	a whole new engine
2018-11-25 02:27:19	mushmouth	runs on linux,windows
2018-11-25 02:28:22	mushmouth	they are making a game which is not just a straight off rip off
2018-11-25 02:28:27	mushmouth	but still support the old songs and such
2018-11-25 03:06:40	khuxkm|lounge	https://reg.null maybe I'll get khuxkm.null :P
2018-11-25 03:08:27	mushmouth	i support the .null idea
2018-11-25 03:11:08	khuxkm|lounge	yeah this whole thing's opened my eyes to the OpenNIC world
2018-11-25 03:11:42	ubergeek|lounge	FWIW, the .tilde servers resolve opennic as well
2018-11-25 03:12:11	ubergeek|lounge	My goal is to not be a part of opennic neccesarily, but they delegate to us for it
2018-11-25 03:12:30	ubergeek|lounge	Maybe if it ever gets grown up, maybe a part of opennic
2018-11-25 03:13:19	mushmouth	that neat ubergeek|lounge 
2018-11-25 03:15:45	mushmouth	what do you run for your dns?
2018-11-25 03:22:00	khuxkm|lounge	.null domains are ded
2018-11-25 03:22:18	khuxkm|lounge	it tries to check with deep-web.zone
2018-11-25 03:22:21	khuxkm|lounge	(dead URL)
2018-11-25 03:22:42	khuxkm|lounge	ubergeek|lounge: have you tested our tier 1 with OpenNIC?
2018-11-25 03:24:22	ubergeek|lounge	I just run bind9
2018-11-25 03:24:45	ubergeek|lounge	Kuhuxm, don't know what you mean?
2018-11-25 03:25:11	khuxkm|lounge	like, is our Tier 1 server up to snuff with the OpenNIC tests
2018-11-25 03:25:39	khuxkm|lounge	If you want to ever have a hope of joining OpenNIC we have to play by their rules, which includes having a Tier 1 that passes the tests
2018-11-25 03:27:25	ubergeek|lounge	No, I don't so right now.  We don't load their root zone, so we don't answer properly
2018-11-25 03:27:51	ubergeek|lounge	We just recurse for opennic
2018-11-25 03:28:12	ubergeek|lounge	Also, I think I saw some other rules they had that we need to work on
2018-11-25 03:33:25	khuxkm|lounge	hmm
2018-11-25 03:36:57	ubergeek|lounge	But, it's in the works, nonetheless

2018-11-25 04:10:23	edwardthefma	 Its probably one of 2 things a port issue or a hostname issue
2018-11-25 04:10:56	~deepend	well yourtilde is pretty strict on port usage.. but let me know if its a port issue and we can figure something out  :D
2018-11-25 04:11:33	edwardthefma	What port should he use
2018-11-25 04:11:43	ben	just use an ssh tunnel
2018-11-25 04:12:32	edwardthefma	Weechat app is better than ssh tunnel
2018-11-25 04:15:12	ben	?
2018-11-25 04:15:54	edwardthefma	 He is trying to use 59889

2018-11-27 23:30:30	amcclure[team]	Is there a way to disable TildeBot 
2018-11-27 23:30:36	amcclure[team]	just wondering
2018-11-27 23:30:57	ben	you'd have to convince deepend to disconnect it
2018-11-27 23:30:59	~deepend	disable tildebot.. who would want to do that lol
2018-11-27 23:31:18	ben	not me

2018-11-27 23:45:43	~deepend	ben technically has access to TildeBot but would have to be local on yourtilde to really access its console.. since ports aren't open that need to be to allow outside connections

2018-11-28 04:53:44	ben	heh well i'll start with an inspircd build from scratch
2018-11-28 05:00:08	~deepend	i'm sure there is some utility you could run to max the memory out
2018-11-28 05:01:32	slipyx	minecraft.exe
2018-11-28 05:02:10	ben	lol that would do it

2018-11-28 05:17:20	ben	lol sure thing
2018-11-28 05:25:04	~deepend	really wished i would have kept the server I had with either vultr or digital ocean (cant remember which one) but had one  vps from them that has a 10Gbit connection.. was sweet .. but dont think they offer that anymore :S
2018-11-28 05:29:40	ben	10gbit!!!

2018-11-28 05:41:17	ben	better deals than hetzner?
2018-11-28 05:43:05	~deepend	doubt it... but hetzner doesnt offer 25 dollars in credit when signing up either

2018-11-28 20:53:32	amcclure	for a non-linux os
2018-11-28 20:54:50	jan6	bsd?

2018-11-28 23:33:11	~deepend	amcclure: unfortunately I do not offer any sort of VPS or containers.
2018-11-28 23:35:26	~deepend	so anyone knows. upcloud seems like somewhat of a scam.. the 5 dollar server is showing 9 dollars per month after running it for an evening.. so clearly the billing is not accurate.
2018-11-29 01:27:22	ubergeek	for physicals, it depends on your use case, really.
2018-11-29 01:38:28	edwardthefma	Sup deepend
2018-11-29 01:39:30	edwardthefma	If you need a vps a free shell service isn't the place to go
2018-11-29 01:40:20	ubergeek	well, s/he's looking for a physical, not a vps.
2018-11-29 01:40:43	ubergeek	But, how/where to get a physical really matters for what it's being used for
2018-11-29 01:41:14	ubergeek	I'd argue most folks don't really need physical boxes.  Sometimes, it's not the case, but they are rare, but they are also valid when it gets there
2018-11-29 01:42:27	~deepend	seems to be wanting windows for some reason.. a low end vps would not be a good solution for a windows box lol 
2018-11-29 01:43:31	ubergeek	aws offers windows machines :P
2018-11-29 01:43:41	ubergeek	I use one for some steam games.
2018-11-29 01:45:20	ben	steam games in the cloud?
2018-11-29 01:47:19	~deepend	most place offers windows machines  lol
2018-11-29 01:47:42	~deepend	but always comes at a premium
2018-11-29 01:48:08	ben	extra licensing nonsense
2018-11-29 01:48:54	~deepend	yep. unfortunately.. 
2018-11-29 01:49:25	ubergeek	yeah, I rent a GPU instance in AWS and run steam games over Steamlink to my local machine.
2018-11-29 01:49:49	ubergeek	It's only for the rare times I need a win-only game that needs a gigapower GPU
2018-11-29 01:50:15	~deepend	lol  how much that cost on aws.. since aws is kinda pricey
2018-11-29 01:50:20	ubergeek	Because I refuse to pay more than $100 for a graphics card, and that's pushing it
2018-11-29 01:50:33	ubergeek	I think for total cost, it worked out to like $0.26/hr
2018-11-29 01:50:47	~deepend	so you think I'm crazy for buying my 1080ti when I did? LOL 
2018-11-29 01:50:48	ubergeek	Isn't a big deal if I only use if for a few hours a month
2018-11-29 01:50:57	ubergeek	If you game a lot, not at all :)
2018-11-29 01:51:15	ben	lol i have a 1080ti too
2018-11-29 01:51:15	ubergeek	I don't game a lot, and most of my games run fine on a integrated card.  Nethack doesn't need much
2018-11-29 01:51:17	~deepend	i game sometimes.. I just wanted one that'll keep up longer term
2018-11-29 01:51:21	ben	but i play quite a bit of games
2018-11-29 01:51:27	ben	in 4k
2018-11-29 01:51:33	ubergeek	And KOTOR is rather lightweight as well
2018-11-29 01:51:42	ubergeek	I don't think you can do 4K streaming :P
2018-11-29 01:51:45	ben	that's an interesting solution
2018-11-29 01:51:46	ben	lol yeah no
2018-11-29 01:51:50	ben	that's huge latency
2018-11-29 01:52:01	~deepend	had a 1070 before I decided to sell that and buy the 1080ti
2018-11-29 01:52:18	ben	i had an rx480

2018-11-29 01:53:39	~deepend	looks interesting.. might toy with that one day
2018-11-29 01:54:26	ubergeek	Well, it's nice to play with, but if you already have a high-end rig, it'd be a waste aside from learning something
2018-11-29 01:54:35	ubergeek	I generally use potatoes for computers :P
2018-11-29 01:55:02	ubergeek	Whatever I can get refurb for ~$250 in a business class machine :)
2018-11-29 01:55:09	~deepend	I have a few potatoes I could try it with.. :D  
2018-11-29 01:55:13	ubergeek	lol
2018-11-29 01:55:53	ubergeek	Like right now, my main machine is a Dell latitude E6420
2018-11-29 01:56:10	~deepend	nothing wrong with that
2018-11-29 01:56:32	~deepend	I'm a cheap ass tho.. if its old business class systesm I usually dont pay more then like 30 bucks 
2018-11-29 01:57:58	~deepend	I have a bad habit of low balling ebay offers at a place thats local to me that is a electronics recycler.. so they usually accept my low ball offer and away I go :D  most I've ever spent all at once with them was 250.. and that was my current main server at home.. 
2018-11-29 01:58:43	~deepend	not the newest machine ever but is the newest server I have
2018-11-29 01:58:51	ubergeek	the only reason I go "up to 250" is I buy certified refurbs from Amazon.  They have a 90 day warranty, and come with all accesories you'd get from the box new
2018-11-29 01:58:58	ben	heh i definitely splurged on my current gear
2018-11-29 01:59:04	ben	x1 carbon gen 5
2018-11-29 01:59:09	ubergeek	And I usually look for what they handed out at work last year as my target :)
2018-11-29 01:59:13	ben	and my gaming rig is reasonably beefy
2018-11-29 01:59:16	ubergeek	That's a nice machine though
2018-11-29 01:59:18	ben	https://bhh.sh/build

2018-11-29 01:59:34	ubergeek	If I were to splurge, it'd likely be on a Dell XPS 13 Dev edition
2018-11-29 01:59:35	ben	x1 carbon is stupid nice
2018-11-29 01:59:41	ubergeek	yep yep
2018-11-29 01:59:46	ubergeek	I drool, no lie
2018-11-29 01:59:48	ben	ehhh i'd rather beefy up the x1carbon
2018-11-29 01:59:57	ben	embeefen
2018-11-29 02:00:02	~deepend	i got rid of my laptop.. only laptop i have thats even remotely current is a core i3 system.  that doesn't have a battery
2018-11-29 02:00:20	ben	i'm actually on my laptop right now
2018-11-29 02:00:21	ubergeek	lol.  I swung the other way:  No more desktops
2018-11-29 02:00:26	ben	and my pc is in windows for games
2018-11-29 02:00:40	ben	i have a work laptop too but i leave that there
2018-11-29 02:00:59	~deepend	laptops dont leave enough room for upgrades in future.
2018-11-29 02:01:01	ubergeek	once speeds and specs started not double every year, laptops are what I go with.  Got no time to upgrde and tinker with hardware anymore too many other projects :P
2018-11-29 02:01:09	ben	lol that's fair
2018-11-29 02:01:19	ben	i haven't touched any upgrades in my pc for like a year and a half now
2018-11-29 02:01:24	ben	maybe only a year
2018-11-29 02:01:36	ubergeek	Yeah, in reality, I've not seen a need to upgrade a machine in a long time, aside from SSDs, and maybe more RAM
2018-11-29 02:01:36	ben	but i hardly ever do anything inside it
2018-11-29 02:01:55	~deepend	lol  i haven't upgraded my pc in awhile now.. only thing I've changed is I loaned out half my memory to a friend
2018-11-29 02:02:03	ben	yeah, ram requirements scale with the number of electron apps you run
2018-11-29 02:02:05	~deepend	so I guess I downgraded 
2018-11-29 02:02:07	~deepend	lol
2018-11-29 02:02:10	ben	rip
2018-11-29 02:02:13	ubergeek	And 256GB SSDs...  Hardly seen a need for more, with the nextcloud instance, and more than 16GB seems...  superfluous
2018-11-29 02:02:25	ben	yeah it definitely it
2018-11-29 02:02:29	ben	but i got a crazy deal on ram
2018-11-29 02:02:33	ben	$140 for 32gb
2018-11-29 02:02:42	ubergeek	For that price, I would have grabbed it
2018-11-29 02:02:46	ben	before prices blew up
2018-11-29 02:02:55	ben	$70 each for a 16gb kit
2018-11-29 02:02:57	ben	4 8gb sticks
2018-11-29 02:03:05	ben	ddr4 at that
2018-11-29 02:03:06	ubergeek	you loaned out memory deepend 
2018-11-29 02:03:08	ubergeek	?
2018-11-29 02:03:10	ubergeek	lol
2018-11-29 02:03:13	~deepend	i spent too much on ram.. but it was before the ram prices went up.. i have 32GB Corsair Dominator Platinums
2018-11-29 02:03:24	ubergeek	At least you didn't fall for RAMBUS did you?
2018-11-29 02:03:29	ben	tbh i don't even know what kind of ram i have
2018-11-29 02:03:37	ben	it's on the pcpartpicker list
2018-11-29 02:03:41	~deepend	yes ubergeek .. loaned out 16GB of my 32 to a friend that was having memory troubles.. 
2018-11-29 02:04:20	ubergeek	I guess you're not hurting for RAM, though
2018-11-29 02:04:26	ubergeek	Have you ever maxed out RAM doing anything?
2018-11-29 02:04:49	ubergeek	I do understand I'm a special case, as most of my work/play is terminal-based
2018-11-29 02:05:02	~deepend	nope.. i miss it though.. since it left gaps in my memory.. now there is empty spaces between dimms.. doH! Lol
2018-11-29 02:05:02	ben	i haven't maxed out on ram yet
2018-11-29 02:05:07	ben	only on my laptpo
2018-11-29 02:05:11	ben	which is 8gb
2018-11-29 02:05:29	ubergeek	Dammit, there goes that memory of me and my dad playing catch! :P
2018-11-29 02:05:49	~deepend	maybe I should just run my alienware system I have.. (pre-dell alienware)
2018-11-29 02:06:22	ubergeek	deepend: any reason you picked that keyboard?
2018-11-29 02:06:35	~deepend	which keyboard?
2018-11-29 02:06:53	ubergeek	the coolermaster RGB cherry red
2018-11-29 02:07:10	~deepend	me no have?
2018-11-29 02:08:09	~deepend	i have a mad catz keyboard.. 
2018-11-29 02:08:11	ubergeek	I know the knockoff cherry switches have gotten quite good lately.  I have a knock off black, and actually prefer it over genuine blacks
2018-11-29 02:08:26	ubergeek	It'd likely cut your price in half for the keyboard
2018-11-29 02:08:44	~deepend	i need a new keyboard if someone wants to buy one and send it my way.. LMAO  i have a mad catz v7 keyboard :D 
2018-11-29 02:09:52	ubergeek	nm, I thought you posted the parts list...  it was ben
2018-11-29 02:10:17	ubergeek	i'm a nard
2018-11-29 02:10:17	ben	o/
2018-11-29 02:10:19	~deepend	yep.. was confused.. thought maybe you seen my pic I posted lol :D 
2018-11-29 02:10:23	ben	reading is hard
2018-11-29 02:11:47	ubergeek	so, ben, any reason you went with that keyboard? :P
2018-11-29 02:11:52	ben	lol
2018-11-29 02:11:59	ben	i liked the tight clean lines
2018-11-29 02:12:05	ben	probably didn't need rgb
2018-11-29 02:12:24	ubergeek	rgb is kinda nice.
2018-11-29 02:12:25	ben	i leave it on blue all the time to match the rest of my rig
2018-11-29 02:12:32	ben	reds for gaming
2018-11-29 02:12:50	ben	it's super solid
2018-11-29 02:12:56	ubergeek	and I dont think buckling springs are good for gaming :P
2018-11-29 02:13:04	ben	might be?
2018-11-29 02:13:09	ben	never know til ya try :P
2018-11-29 02:13:25	ben	a lot of the gaming i've been doing has been with a controller
2018-11-29 02:13:25	ubergeek	I did aight in Doom 2 on a Model F...
2018-11-29 02:13:34	ben	xbox controller connected to the pc

2018-11-29 02:15:23	ubergeek	I *wish* my corner was that clean.
2018-11-29 02:15:37	ubergeek	Unfortunatley, my "office desk" doubles as a soldering station
2018-11-29 02:15:54	ubergeek	Which means parts and wires and breadboards where my keyboard *should* be
2018-11-29 02:16:00	~deepend	its not always that clean.. lol
2018-11-29 02:16:12	ubergeek	and pile of in-progress hardware on the other half lol

I have a big L shaped desk in basement that is where most of my hardware and crap gets tossed around
2018-11-29 02:19:41	ubergeek	Sounds like mine too.  Now, I don't feel so bad :P

2018-11-29 02:35:04	~deepend	sometimes hard to line it up perfectly.. could also mean the case isn't on correctly tho

2018-11-29 03:09:02	~deepend	i officially requested deletion.. so in like 20 some odd days I will be facebookless unless I log in and it restores it before then.. but I think I'll be ok

2018-11-29 03:12:06	~deepend	so ben after going over my opendkim setup.. i really think the only issue I had was not starting the opendkim service :P lol

2018-11-29 03:14:05	ben	https://bhh.sh/pub/photos/fullsetup.jpg
2018-11-29 03:14:07	ben	.jpg
2018-11-29 03:14:20	mushmouth	i like your carpet and everything
2018-11-29 03:14:26	mushmouth	feels "complete"
2018-11-29 03:16:29	~deepend	mine only feels like a complete mess :P
2018-11-29 03:19:03	ben	this is the room i spend the most time in lol
2018-11-29 03:22:32	~deepend	nothing wrong with that :D  only place I have room for this computer is my living room.. basement is mostly servers and old computers.. (i plan on doing something different with basement) eventually atleast
2018-11-29 03:25:51	ben	finished basements are dope
2018-11-29 03:27:07	~deepend	is an unfinished basement.. but I use it like a finished basement lol  have half the basement to myself and my computer shit and the other half is setup for the kids (computer desk , tv, consoles and toys)
2018-11-29 03:27:59	ben	so it's all the same down there
2018-11-29 03:28:03	ben	just different kinds of toys
2018-11-29 03:28:41	~deepend	yeah.. a basement full of toys! LMAO
2018-11-29 03:29:04	ben	:D
2018-11-29 03:29:46	~deepend	everything from C64's Apple IICX's decent I7 gaming system, other old computers, a shit load of sega genesis, original nintendo and other stuff.. is a nut house down there.. 
2018-11-29 03:31:33	ben	all the way through to a nintendo switch
2018-11-29 03:31:34	ben	lol
2018-11-29 03:32:05	~deepend	lol.. nope. nothing new from nintendo for me.. not a nintendo fan really.. I just like the original nintendo.. and have a couple nintendo wii's
2018-11-29 03:40:01	ben	"a couple"
2018-11-29 03:40:32	~deepend	lol.. have one on main floor that i used to use for guitar hero and one in basement for kids to play
2018-11-29 03:48:11	~deepend	apparently I need to increase the disk size on yourtilde.. oops.. no shock. since the original setup of this vm was only a test.. wasnt sure Id actually do anything with it lol
2018-11-29 03:49:41	ben	you have 35gb free still
2018-11-29 03:49:45	~deepend	but it'll have to wait.. since that would involve downtime to make a disk size change
2018-11-29 03:49:54	~deepend	not on /home i dont
2018-11-29 03:50:21	ben	oh and 15gb free on there
2018-11-29 03:50:25	~deepend	not out of space. but I would like to be less close to being out
2018-11-29 03:51:38	~deepend	this server was originally built as a test machine to see if I could create any sort of tilde on it.. and well I didn't rebuild on a fresh vm since it went so well.. so original spec I set was 100GB drive.. only 45G of that to /home
2018-11-29 03:56:25	ben	i don't do separate partitions
2018-11-29 03:56:54	~deepend	I do these days.. because in past /home would fill the entire disk and bring the whole server down since linux doesn't like having a full disk
2018-11-29 03:57:27	ben	ahh i suppose
2018-11-29 03:58:13	~deepend	so this way.. /home being full will only be annoying.. not causing shit to break.. lol 
2018-11-29 03:59:01	ben	good idea
2018-11-29 03:59:15	ben	quotas 
2018-11-29 03:59:21	ben	i think i'm going to have to quotas
2018-11-29 03:59:40	~deepend	yeah probably not a bad idea
2018-11-29 04:00:04	~deepend	give everyone 5MB.  thats plenty for a html page  :P  
2018-11-29 04:00:33	ben	right!
2018-11-29 04:00:44	~deepend	and some .dot files :D 
2018-11-29 04:07:48	~deepend	wonder if there is a way to remove the RAID configuration on this server without breaking the OS.. LOL   would be nice to have 4 2TB drives instead of running 4 drives in RAID.. ovh sets the drives up by default in RAID 1
2018-11-29 04:09:54	ben	oh yeah hetzner does the same thing
2018-11-29 04:10:48	~deepend	just seems like a waste to mirror 4 drives.. so I'm loosing 6TB of space :S
2018-11-29 04:11:31	ben	srsly
2018-11-29 04:11:31	~deepend	1253647684   this is whats free space on the main machine running this vm
2018-11-29 04:11:43	ben	numbers like that are so hard to read without commas
2018-11-29 04:12:04	~deepend	is the way df gives it to me..lol
2018-11-29 04:12:33	slipyx	doesnt centos have -h?
2018-11-29 04:12:40	ben	df -h
2018-11-29 04:12:46	slipyx	did it disable it for "more secure"
2018-11-29 04:12:51	ben	lol
2018-11-29 04:12:56	~deepend	keep forgetting about -h
2018-11-29 04:13:11	ben	df -hx tmpfs
2018-11-29 04:13:14	~deepend	1.2T 
2018-11-29 04:13:21	slipyx	tildebytes
2018-11-29 04:13:23	ben	who cares about tmpfs anywyas
2018-11-29 04:13:26	ben	lol tildebytes
2018-11-29 04:13:35	~deepend	lol
2018-11-29 04:13:52	slipyx	can we copystrike the terrabyte
2018-11-29 04:13:54	ben	what do you use to manage VMs
2018-11-29 04:13:54	slipyx	like right now
2018-11-29 04:13:56	~deepend	just sad to only have 2TB total out of the 8TB that the server is configured with :D 
2018-11-29 04:14:04	ben	srsly
2018-11-29 04:14:36	~deepend	I should have changed it when I setup the server.. since ovh does make modifying it really easy when you first set it up.
2018-11-29 04:15:38	~deepend	wouldn't in theory be able to literally delete the partitions from the other 3 drives?  its a software raid
2018-11-29 04:16:17	~deepend	virtualbox ontop of centos is what I am using at the moment.. 
2018-11-29 04:16:34	~deepend	I used to be big into Vmware ESXi.. but got away from that
2018-11-29 04:19:41	~deepend	https://www.tecmint.com/manage-software-raid-devices-in-linux-with-mdadm/    does this look like I should be able to just stop the array which would make it so I could reconfigure the drives without raid in theory? 
2018-11-29 04:19:42	@TildeBot	How to Manage Software RAID&#039;s in Linux with &#039;Mdadm&#039; Tool - Part 9 https://bhh.sh/28f
2018-11-29 04:22:39	~deepend	but question is does stoppping the array and removing the array cause issues with my OS/software lol
2018-11-29 04:23:42	ben	hmm

2018-11-29 15:49:11	mushmouth	ubergeek: did you miss with that setup idea i had?
2018-11-29 15:49:13	mushmouth	or want
2018-11-29 15:49:18	mushmouth	mess*
2018-11-29 15:50:02	ubergeek	Pretty sure I did
2018-11-29 15:50:05	mushmouth	perl to me is just evil
2018-11-29 15:51:54	mushmouth	even though i can read it
2018-11-29 15:52:43	ubergeek	Perl can be used to do some pretty bad things.  But, so can bash :P
2018-11-29 15:52:48	ubergeek	See: bocker
2018-11-29 15:56:00	mhj	yo ubergeek 
2018-11-29 15:56:48	mhj	Perl isn't so bad if you start learning using a book like Modern Perl imho
2018-11-29 15:57:10	mhj	It doesn't have be all weird dots and strings lol
2018-11-29 15:57:17	mhj	+to
2018-11-29 16:00:10	mushmouth	mhj: i just asked ubergeek to setup me up something like google alerts
2018-11-29 16:00:16	mushmouth	and rms wget script
2018-11-29 16:03:55	ubergeek	yeah, I need to find some time to sit down and work on that
2018-11-29 16:06:07	mhj	Nice
2018-11-29 16:07:22	mhj	Re: Games: Starfox 64 is pretty good. I got it a long time ago for my birthday lol. I think the multiplayer was the best part imho.
2018-11-29 16:12:55	mushmouth	ubergeek: only when you have free time. don't force yourself to do it for me :)
2018-11-29 16:13:25	mushmouth	mhj: i wish i owned doom and duke nukem for n64
2018-11-29 16:13:31	mushmouth	but sadly the store had none
2018-11-29 16:17:26	mushmouth	might have to buy it from lukie games
2018-11-29 16:30:09	mushmouth	and apparently mom and her friend i think bought me a lot mhj
2018-11-29 16:30:29	mushmouth	mom asked the store owner from the pawnshop/game store i bought the games from
2018-11-29 16:30:35	mushmouth	to put it in a box
2018-11-29 17:27:45	jan6|	then put the bo in a box
2018-11-29 17:29:12	jan6|	hm, mush, I have a project for you, mod some controllers so we can play multiplayer retro games over the internet without emulators
2018-11-29 17:44:10	mushmouth	jan6|: that would be insane
2018-11-29 17:44:14	mushmouth	neat idea
2018-11-29 17:44:17	mushmouth	but insane even for me
2018-11-29 17:44:25	jan6|	heh, why so?
2018-11-29 17:44:31	mushmouth	well
2018-11-29 17:44:41	jan6|	latency would be baad but otherwise?
2018-11-29 17:44:41	mushmouth	i would have to figure out that and i don't think anybody attempted that before
2018-11-29 17:44:59	mushmouth	plus i wouldn't even know where to start
2018-11-29 17:45:02	jan6|	hmm, I'd say most probably has 
2018-11-29 17:45:17	jan6|	raspberry pi?
2018-11-29 17:46:05	jan6|	has gpio, has models with builtin wifi, or just wired if you wish, is basically just linux, so?
2018-11-29 17:46:57	mushmouth	but what im thinking like how do i get a controller with either bluetooth or wireless adapter
2018-11-29 17:47:05	mushmouth	i'd have to remove back case of it
2018-11-29 17:47:15	jan6|	you don't need bluetooth or stuff
2018-11-29 17:47:31	jan6|	just solder into the circuit

2018-12-09 01:53:45	mushmouth	is battle toads for nes?
2018-12-09 01:54:18	@ubergeek	No, but it's great on the Wii
2018-12-09 01:54:46	@ubergeek	srsly, yes, it was a NES game.
2018-12-09 01:56:17	hyperboredoubt	Does anyone here use PuTTy?
2018-12-09 01:58:16	hyperboredoubt	(I assume not. But I'm a Microsoft scrub so I had to.)
2018-12-09 01:58:49	ben	i'd recommend msys2 or gitbash if you have to use windows
2018-12-09 01:59:04	@ubergeek	If you're a winderz person, I recommend MobaXterm

2018-12-09 02:00:56	@ubergeek	I got hooked on it when I need a remote x session
2018-12-09 02:01:30	ben	oh i suppose that's fair
2018-12-09 02:01:36	ben	i generally don't need that
2018-12-09 02:04:26	ben	yo deepend there are 61 pending updates
2018-12-09 02:04:42	~deepend	we talking about yourtilde?

2018-12-09 02:08:03	@TildeBot	deepend, Hmm.. Is why i'm awake lol sucks seeing as i was with my last class ends at like 4 hours ago lol.
2018-12-09 02:09:04	ben	i just have it set to run `uptime` and send the results
2018-12-09 02:09:42	~deepend	yeah.. i should just do something simular.. instead of using premade scripts lol
2018-12-09 02:10:35	hyperboredoubt	I'm going to join ALL the tildes! :D
2018-12-09 02:11:59	ben	all of the non-defunct ones lol
2018-12-09 02:13:02	~deepend	yeah.. so many defunct ones :S 
2018-12-09 02:18:33	hyperboredoubt	I am now playing TwitchPlaysPokemon! :D
2018-12-09 02:19:11	slipyx	thats still a thing?
2018-12-09 02:19:37	@ubergeek	I can knock out the updates for us if you want deepdn.
2018-12-09 02:20:44	@ubergeek	I usually get into the office ~7AM, so can do them then.
2018-12-09 02:20:56	@ubergeek	Or, Friday evening I'm free (In case things go south, which I doubt)

2018-12-09 02:21:51	~deepend	in progress
2018-12-09 02:22:18	hyperboredoubt	They are doing a randomized run, so all the Pokemon are fused and have random stats.
2018-12-09 02:22:36	~deepend	probably not best time to do it.. but if things go south today is a good day for me lol
2018-12-09 02:23:50	~deepend	could just delete everything and start over.. probably easier LMAO jk
2018-12-09 02:24:05	ben	updates should be pretty safe tbh
2018-12-09 02:24:14	~deepend	usually
2018-12-09 02:24:39	@ubergeek	graybeard sysadmins don't like doing updates during high-use periods :)
2018-12-09 02:24:43	~deepend	and being centos the updates are usually pretty minor
2018-12-09 02:24:50	ben	can't remember the last time i've had one go wrong
2018-12-09 02:24:53	 *	ben knocks on wood
2018-12-09 02:24:56	@ubergeek	Upgrading to kernel 4.20?
2018-12-09 02:25:11	ben	4.15 on ~team
2018-12-09 02:25:15	@ubergeek	same here, even on Arch...  Upgrades have gotten so...  Passe.
2018-12-09 02:25:22	ben	4.18 on my local machine cause debian testing
2018-12-09 02:25:26	ben	oh arch is far scarier
2018-12-09 02:25:27	~deepend	is there a good reason to move to a 4.x kernel? on a box like this?
2018-12-09 02:25:30	@ubergeek	s/Passe/Passé
2018-12-09 02:25:36	ben	you you're not?

2018-12-09 02:25:48	@ubergeek	Since you're running CentOS
2018-12-09 02:25:58	~deepend	yep.. thats my thought.. 
2018-12-09 02:25:59	slipyx	i know arne updated his centos box to 4.x
2018-12-09 02:26:09	ben	just take whatever's in the repos for that release
2018-12-09 02:26:17	@ubergeek	RHEL backports most of the important stuff to the release kernel anyways
2018-12-09 02:26:30	~deepend	i really think changing kernels like that would just cause me more grief during major updates later on
2018-12-09 02:26:38	@ubergeek	I'm staying on 4.20 forever :)
2018-12-09 02:26:45	ben	i mean yeah i'm just using the release's version
2018-12-09 02:27:17	@ubergeek	Last time I went out of release for kernels on CentOS was way-back-when when loop-AES was a custom module
2018-12-09 02:27:28	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-09 02:27:36	@ubergeek	And I used the same version, just had to build it manually with a couple of patches
2018-12-09 02:27:59	@ubergeek	And that was back in the RHEL 3 days
2018-12-09 02:28:58	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-09 02:29:14	fosslinux	i only started using linux in 2013-14??? can't remeber
2018-12-09 02:29:31	ben	better late than never
2018-12-09 02:29:58	fosslinux	everyone says its hard to learn linux its really not
2018-12-09 02:30:19	@ubergeek	It's not anymore
2018-12-09 02:30:53	@ubergeek	It was hard when there were few books, and those were expensive, and no websites with 20 years of documentation around it.
2018-12-09 02:31:07	fosslinux	lol i wasn't born 20 years ago lmao
2018-12-09 02:32:06	hyperboredoubt	I was.

2018-12-09 02:34:22	~deepend	hey ubergeek .. have an issue.. maybe you have a suggestion..  running weechat in byobu.. when weechat is closed I can paste into this putty window.. when weechat is open I cannot.. lol
2018-12-09 02:34:55	@ubergeek	Is mouse enabled in weechat?
2018-12-09 02:35:15	~deepend	wouldn't that make it not work in general though?   it works fine at terminal
2018-12-09 02:35:22	~deepend	oh weechat
2018-12-09 02:35:28	@ubergeek	Yeah, it would make it not work in weechat, if it's enabled
2018-12-09 02:35:42	@ubergeek	Or *could* make it not work
2018-12-09 02:35:50	fosslinux	hmm weir
2018-12-09 02:35:57	@ubergeek	I have all sorts of problems when enabling curses mouse support in things
2018-12-09 02:36:02	~deepend	is there a short cut key or something.. since my config never changed.. it worked fine one day and not the next
2018-12-09 02:36:03	fosslinux	*vim*

2018-12-09 02:37:04	@ubergeek	 /mouse disable
2018-12-09 02:37:12	@ubergeek	... or off
2018-12-09 02:37:15	@ubergeek	:)
2018-12-09 02:37:26	fosslinux	/set weechat.look.mouse off
2018-12-09 02:37:35	fosslinux	that will set it off at setup
2018-12-09 02:37:42	~deepend	i was at a loss.. must have hit it when trying to do short cut keys for byobu.. lol
2018-12-09 02:37:46	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-09 02:38:28	@ubergeek	That's highly probable...  I do it a lot
2018-12-09 02:38:36	fosslinux	^ same
2018-12-09 02:38:53	@ubergeek	Main reason I knew the "fix" :)
2018-12-09 02:38:56	fosslinux	once i hit something then i couldn't figure how to get tmux out of multi-window on screen mode
2018-12-09 02:39:47	~deepend	and I'm new to all this.. i was one to just open weechat from terminal.. not using any programs like byobu
2018-12-09 02:40:15	~deepend	brb... moving down to my other computer downstairs.  
2018-12-09 02:40:45	fosslinux	kk

2018-12-09 20:02:12	fosslinux	deepend, ubergeek : yourtilde.com is giving me a ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID in chromium 
2018-12-09 20:02:40	~deepend	I will check into it.. maybe it expired.. I keep fogetting to fix the auto renew
2018-12-09 20:02:46	fosslinux	woowwowowow
2018-12-09 20:02:50	fosslinux	likely it expired
2018-12-09 20:03:13	fosslinux	oh no
2018-12-09 20:03:13	~deepend	shows as valid in firefox?  Is your time/date on your computer proper?
2018-12-09 20:03:18	fosslinux	it didn't weird
2018-12-09 20:04:11	fosslinux	different error
2018-12-09 20:04:20	fosslinux	www.yourtilde.com uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is only valid for yourtilde.com. Error code: SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN
2018-12-09 20:04:32	fosslinux	deepend:
2018-12-09 20:04:39	~deepend	oh.. remove www
2018-12-09 20:04:55	~deepend	i dont use www.. i probably should make the cert valid for www as well but I havent
2018-12-09 20:05:03	fosslinux	ahhh there you go
2018-12-09 20:05:44	~deepend	:)  I'll either add www to the ssl cert or I will remove the ability to connect using www.
2018-12-09 20:05:44	fosslinux	ubergeek: until deepend fixes the cert, you might like to change the link to commands help in idlerpg_bot to yourtilde.com/~ubergeek/blah
2018-12-09 20:27:29	jan6	fix the cert, rather
2018-12-09 20:28:00	jan6	pretty sure chrom(ium|e) defaults to www of sites by default, and there was some talk about it not showing it
2018-12-09 20:28:13	ben	you'll need the cert to redirect www to non
2018-12-09 20:28:29	ben	i don't think chrom{e,ium} does that
2018-12-09 20:34:44	jan6	cert to redirect? eh?
2018-12-09 20:36:43	ben	yes
2018-12-09 20:36:57	~deepend	ben: i'll just do that redirect for now.
2018-12-09 20:37:09	ben	if you go to https://www.yourtilde.com it will fail on the cert before it can redirect

2018-12-11 00:51:23	hyperboredoubt	Coded sign language is the only secure method.
2018-12-11 00:53:21	mushmouth	i don't think any electronics are secure
2018-12-11 00:53:27	mushmouth	i hate when people give that argument to me
2018-12-11 00:53:48	mushmouth	look at something called tapliot program

2018-12-11 01:41:09	hyperboredoubt	I actively avoid most news sites since they are little more than corporate propaganda.

2018-12-11 01:54:09	@ubergeek	I *think* the OOB one did...  
2018-12-11 01:54:12	mushmouth	i can't find like any documentation for it
2018-12-11 01:54:48	mushmouth	what is oob in reference to?
2018-12-11 01:54:53	mushmouth	sorry for making you think uber :)
2018-12-11 01:55:10	@ubergeek	out-of-the-box
2018-12-11 01:56:13	@ubergeek	But, I know era-opera mini would support gopher
2018-12-11 01:56:32	mushmouth	it just doesn't tell you on web
2018-12-11 01:56:34	@ubergeek	Gopher was still rather popular until 2002 or such
2018-12-11 01:56:36	mushmouth	or wikipedia
2018-12-11 01:56:57	mushmouth	i might do a better documentation on older os's once i experience them enough
2018-12-11 01:56:58	@ubergeek	sadly, not many people care about gopher support, so it's largely undocumented.
2018-12-11 01:57:01	mushmouth	on my main page
2018-12-11 01:57:13	mushmouth	me and tom are the main ones i feel
2018-12-11 01:57:23	@ubergeek	And, at some point, gopher support was just considered "Normal".  ff just dropped it a couple of years ago
2018-12-11 01:57:34	@ubergeek	main ones that care about gopher support?
2018-12-11 01:57:37	mushmouth	curl still has support for gopher
2018-12-11 01:57:44	mushmouth	main people who care about gopher
2018-12-11 01:57:46	@ubergeek	hrm, it does, doesn't it
2018-12-11 01:57:59	@ubergeek	Well, enough people did to get url support for it in mastodon...

2018-12-11 02:01:14	@ubergeek	there's a pretty strong, and growing gopher community.
2018-12-11 02:01:28	@ubergeek	I see it as part of the whole "Slow Movement".
2018-12-11 02:02:16	mushmouth	well because people in gopher are most likely ethuaist
2018-12-11 02:02:25	mushmouth	where as http seems more commericalized
2018-12-11 02:02:56	mushmouth	like if i can count the ehtuist in gopher it's probably 99 percnet out of 10
2018-12-11 02:03:00	@ubergeek	There's that...  And a feeling of getting just what you need, without the extra 30MB of tracking code
2018-12-11 02:03:08	@ubergeek	probably.
2018-12-11 02:03:16	mushmouth	i meant to say 100
2018-12-11 02:03:31	@ubergeek	But, probably the same for the ~ users, too :)
2018-12-11 02:03:36	mushmouth	yeah and it's not like lagging up your system gopher is really simple
2018-12-11 02:03:52	@ubergeek	lagging up?
2018-12-11 02:03:57	@ubergeek	you mean bogging it down?
2018-12-11 02:04:01	hyperboredoubt	We should make a Tilde language...
2018-12-11 02:04:03	mushmouth	like normal web or modern web is really slow as fuck
2018-12-11 02:04:10	@ubergeek	It is...
2018-12-11 02:04:26	@ubergeek	Case in point, I went camping, and was relegated to a 3G data network for most of the time.
2018-12-11 02:04:34	hyperboredoubt	It is pretty fast on my computer...
2018-12-11 02:04:36	@ubergeek	Hardly any "apps" worked very well.
2018-12-11 02:04:52	@ubergeek	My mosh connection to yourtilde and team?  Never noticed.
2018-12-11 02:04:52	mushmouth	most apps or software are more electron pieces of shit now and days
2018-12-11 02:05:02	@ubergeek	gopher loaded lickety plit

2018-12-11 02:06:14	mushmouth	ubergeek: and the gopher daemons are slow and fast too
2018-12-11 02:06:18	mushmouth	and low code
2018-12-11 02:06:41	mushmouth	http???
2018-12-11 02:06:43	mushmouth	good luck
2018-12-11 02:10:08	mushmouth	ubergeek: have you saw the 2007 gopher mirror video?
2018-12-11 02:10:11	mushmouth	from the creators
2018-12-11 02:10:23	hyperboredoubt	We should develop a secret language to chat in on Gopher. ;D

2018-12-11 02:13:52	mushmouth	hyperboredoubt: nah we don't need another language just pure english please :)
2018-12-11 02:13:57	mushmouth	or japanese if your into that
2018-12-11 02:14:54	hyperboredoubt	But I like inventing languages. :(
2018-12-11 02:15:23	mushmouth	:P
2018-12-11 02:15:52	mushmouth	hyperboredoubt: don't worry im not stopping you
2018-12-11 02:20:37	@ubergeek	I'm watching that video now...
2018-12-11 02:22:18	mushmouth	ubergeek: it really interesting
2018-12-11 02:22:22	mushmouth	the creators behind gopher
2018-12-11 02:23:01	hyperboredoubt	What about them?
2018-12-11 02:23:16	mushmouth	they made a video i linked not so long ago on archive.org
2018-12-11 02:23:28	mushmouth	fun to see what their mindset was and how they made gopher
2018-12-11 02:26:22	@ubergeek	Yeah, UMN kinda screwed the pooch with gopher, and trying to charge people for it
2018-12-11 02:27:32	mushmouth	but now that it's open
2018-12-11 02:27:37	mushmouth	i feel like people are willing to use it
2018-12-11 02:27:44	mushmouth	and that's where the community is
2018-12-11 02:32:07	mushmouth	it's old barely touched
2018-12-11 02:32:13	mushmouth	so people can enjoy it now

2018-12-12 01:11:41	hyperboredoubt	It is a little difficult. I have all the sentences. I just have to put them in order.
2018-12-12 01:12:33	~deepend	oh. is it something thats made already and you have to figure out or something?
2018-12-12 01:13:31	hyperboredoubt	I tend to use the cut-up method a lot for my poems, so I just need to rearrange them into a narrative.

2018-12-13 02:05:16	hyperboredoubt	NNTP? Wasn't that the Tor image board network? @ubergeek.

2018-12-13 02:08:57	~deepend	and the full usenet feed should still function
2018-12-13 02:09:14	@ubergeek	hrm, I'm might need to reconfigure something.  I just went to try it out, and it didn't work, but my settings might be off
2018-12-13 02:09:18	@ubergeek	and evening :)
2018-12-13 02:09:26	@ubergeek	hyperboredoubt: that's actually kinda a neat project
2018-12-13 02:09:50	@ubergeek	I was kicking around a web wrapper to nntp to funciton like a federated forums

2018-12-13 02:17:28	@ubergeek	Last time I traveled, I brought a handheld Atari flashback.  That was the jam :)
2018-12-13 02:17:49	mhj	That sounds cool
2018-12-13 02:17:56	~deepend	they make an atari flashback handheld??
2018-12-13 02:17:57	mhj	I didn't know they made handheld ones
2018-12-13 02:18:22	mhj	Personally I want an Arcade 1up Street Fighter 2 cabinet
2018-12-13 02:18:41	mhj	It's like $300 tho lol
2018-12-13 02:19:13	mhj	As far as computing stuff goes, I'll probably be setting up another Digital Ocean instance
2018-12-13 02:19:13	~deepend	send me 300.. and I'll let you know how it is.. LOL :P
2018-12-13 02:19:42	@ubergeek	there's some DIY cabinet plans, which step you through how to get them screen printed
2018-12-13 02:19:46	~deepend	whacha gonna do on a DO instance?
2018-12-13 02:19:58	@ubergeek	probably end up costing more than a used cab though lol
2018-12-13 02:20:00	mhj	I just don't have a clue what I'll use for yet
2018-12-13 02:20:14	@ubergeek	Make a tilde! (Not really)
2018-12-13 02:20:14	mhj	Ah maaaan
2018-12-13 02:20:22	@ubergeek	Unless you relly want to
2018-12-13 02:20:36	~deepend	what happened to the tilde or whatever it was you had mhj 
2018-12-13 02:20:44	mhj	Well not really, I think yourtilde fulfills my needs for now
2018-12-13 02:21:03	mhj	I just lost interest in maintaining it

2018-12-13 02:21:26	@ubergeek	yeah, after living in ~team, I decided to move back to ~yourtilde for a bit
2018-12-13 02:21:26	ben	long time now se
2018-12-13 02:21:27	mhj	yo ben
2018-12-13 02:21:39	mhj	I've just been kinda busy
2018-12-13 02:21:45	ben	fair enough
2018-12-13 02:21:50	ben	ubergeek: was it something missing?
2018-12-13 02:21:51	@ubergeek	last hold out is chat, gotta finish getting it configured.
2018-12-13 02:22:00	@ubergeek	Was what missing something?  ~team?
2018-12-13 02:22:22	@ubergeek	Nah, just switching out for a bit, which really just means which one do I initially log into :)
2018-12-13 02:22:37	@ubergeek	CentOS v Ubuntu, like to play in both :)
2018-12-13 02:23:10	ben	lol that's fari
2018-12-13 02:23:27	ben	i still recommend running your weechat on the one you get better ping on
2018-12-13 02:23:36	~deepend	ubergeek: to use the local nntp you need to connect via localhost.. 
2018-12-13 02:23:41	@ubergeek	ah...
2018-12-13 02:23:49	slipyx	who u callin fari
2018-12-13 02:24:18	~deepend	when I set it up I gave only localhost users access to it.. maybe I should change that.. would anyone actually use it if they could access it externally?
2018-12-13 02:25:51	@ubergeek	I would only do localhost for users, personally
2018-12-13 02:25:58	@ubergeek	No need for that sort of headache
2018-12-13 02:25:58	@TildeBot	no u infinity ubergeek
2018-12-13 02:26:34	~deepend	sounds good.  wish people would use it more.. but I guess I"m not innocent on that either.. 
2018-12-13 02:26:42	@ubergeek	I plan on it.
2018-12-13 02:26:46	mhj	I think I might setup a personal game server again, and the other DO instance will be for personal website stuff since SDF goes down so much. But this site would be more about hosting tutorials for software, maybe lol. Still up in the air
2018-12-13 02:26:49	@ubergeek	Hence, me bring it up now.  Forgot it was here
2018-12-13 02:27:09	@ubergeek	mhj:  you were running the minetest instance, right?
2018-12-13 02:27:13	mhj	yeah
2018-12-13 02:27:46	mhj	I just wish minetest had better documentation
2018-12-13 02:27:52	@ubergeek	yet another thing I have been slacking on
2018-12-13 02:28:16	mhj	I'm so used to OpenBSD's manpages 
2018-12-13 02:28:23	mhj	And the FreeBSD handbook
2018-12-13 02:28:29	@ubergeek	*BSD has some damned good manpages..
2018-12-13 02:28:50	ben	i think the tildeverse.org minetest server is still up lol
2018-12-13 02:29:47	mhj	And since FreeBSD 12 just released, I might move my system over to that from OpenBSD(yet again lol). But this time NOT use ZFS since ZFS basically took up all my RAM lmao
2018-12-13 02:29:47	~deepend	lol
2018-12-13 02:31:16	~deepend	tonight I think I'm going to attempt a reboot of the yourtilde server.. keep putting it off cuz I like seeing the uptime continue upwards ... lol
2018-12-13 02:31:33	@ubergeek	hahaha
2018-12-13 02:31:53	@ubergeek	any concerns it wont come back up?
2018-12-13 02:32:11	mhj	But ZFS is awesome, more awesome than some people think. Basically every system now supports ZFS, even Windows lol.
2018-12-13 02:32:23	~deepend	nope..  just wanna do it during slower times.. lol 
2018-12-13 02:32:35	mhj	So you could send a zpool volume to it and then send it to your FreeNAS server
2018-12-13 02:33:01	~deepend	would like to just boot up fully on the updated kernel and stuff.. not that the kernel isn't live patched... so technically I could just leave it run.
2018-12-13 02:33:04	mhj	(Not that I have a Windows machine to use it on anymore)
2018-12-13 02:33:26	mhj	Just OpenBSD and ElementaryOS on my laptop
2018-12-13 02:34:20	~deepend	I'm using pop os by system76.. i know its basically ubuntu. but runs very well
2018-12-13 02:34:40	mhj	Cool! What does PopOS do that Ubuntu doesn't
2018-12-13 02:36:14	~deepend	i always have some sort of trouble with ubuntu.. PopOS from my experience is a more polished version of ubuntu.  and is focused on just working with stuff.. like they offer 2 variations.. an AMD/Intel version and a NVidia version.  
2018-12-13 02:36:26	mhj	Noice
2018-12-13 02:36:55	~deepend	I run it on my other slower computers.. so thought I'd toy with it on this machine. and so far works really well.. 
2018-12-13 02:37:22	mhj	That's good
2018-12-13 02:37:26	~deepend	GTA5 under proton in steam works very well
2018-12-13 02:37:43	mhj	I didn't think you played such kiddy games deepend 
2018-12-13 02:37:51	mhj	;)

2018-12-13 02:41:58	mhj	One thing tho, I really should make a seperate FAT32 or NTFS partition that holds all my movies and stuff. It's annoying to keep backing everything up and then redo everything. I know how to do partitioning right but I'm too lazy to set it up lmao
2018-12-13 02:42:52	mhj	Since I change systems so frequently
2018-12-13 02:44:19	~deepend	no doubt... i'll be setting up a server here again for my files.. only took it down to utilize my servers better... but haven't put any time into it as of yet lol
2018-12-13 02:44:20	@TildeBot	no u infinity deepend
2018-12-13 02:46:09	mhj	Yeah, I think I can setup a FreeBSD server on my Rpi, but whenever I try to scp loads of large files it always fails eventually :X
2018-12-13 02:47:27	mhj	I would try uhh, what's it called
2018-12-13 02:47:45	~deepend	just run openmediavault.. if it'd run on a rpi of course lol 
2018-12-13 02:48:25	mhj	OpenMediaVault? Never heard of it lol

2018-12-17 01:50:52	mushmouth	i like bfmv a lot
2018-12-17 01:51:15	mushmouth	used to listen to them a lot when i was younger
2018-12-17 01:54:28	mushmouth	ubergeek: the waking the demon song really hits close to home
2018-12-17 01:54:35	mushmouth	if you watch the music video
2018-12-17 01:59:45	@ubergeek	by Mass Casualty?
2018-12-17 02:00:03	@ubergeek	Or, BFMV?
2018-12-17 02:00:19	mushmouth	BFMV
2018-12-17 02:01:51	@ubergeek	oh
2018-12-17 02:02:16	@ubergeek	I figured, started watching the video.
2018-12-17 02:02:53	@ubergeek	That happened to me twice (Getting bullied).  I "fixed" that problem by meeting up with the guys one at a time, and beat them with my skateboard.
2018-12-17 02:03:26	@ubergeek	What they failed to take into account was a nerd that grew up in the projects, and knew his way around the street lol
2018-12-17 02:04:09	@ubergeek	Also, I wasn't one to believe in a "fair fight".
2018-12-17 02:04:24	mushmouth	me either. one kid was being annoying to me in gradeschool
2018-12-17 02:04:42	mushmouth	i just slamed his head to the heater. because i had enough
2018-12-17 02:06:10	@ubergeek	See, I had to make sure I didn't do anything "in school", because then it would involve my parents, haha
2018-12-17 02:06:29	mushmouth	i didn't care
2018-12-17 02:06:44	mushmouth	also in highschool i had kids constantly bully 
2018-12-17 02:06:49	mushmouth	i really felt like fighting them
2018-12-17 02:07:05	mushmouth	im pretty tough too. as a kid when i had to get my neddle done it had to take 5 nurses to hold me down
2018-12-17 02:07:10	mushmouth	so imagine if i were to go all out in fighting
2018-12-17 02:07:40	mushmouth	the kid would be probably pretty close to murdered or in a hospital
2018-12-17 02:07:48	@ubergeek	luckily, for me I guess, was it was a pretty typical alpha dominance thing.  Like being in jail, once you beat one of them down, it just tends to stop
2018-12-17 02:08:21	mushmouth	they kept stopping me in highschool and such saying "Do you want to fight?"
2018-12-17 02:08:29	mushmouth	i was tempted one day to say fuck it im fighting you
2018-12-17 02:08:37	mushmouth	to get you to fuck off
2018-12-17 02:11:58	@ubergeek	Well, I probably would have, just for that reason.
2018-12-17 02:12:21	@ubergeek	One reason I'm old now.  Don't get into situations like that.
2018-12-17 02:12:42	@ubergeek	Last time I had to threaten bodily harm was when a woman was being dragged down the street by her SO (presumably)
2018-12-17 02:12:59	@ubergeek	I drove up, got out, and told him to let her go.  He reached behind his back like he was grabbing a gun.
2018-12-17 02:13:29	@ubergeek	As soon as I saw that, I told him,"You better have a gun, because if not, you're a fucking grease mark..."  Then chased him down.
2018-12-17 02:13:45	@ubergeek	Gave up a block or so away, because at that time I was a 2 pack a day smoker, and slovenly lol
2018-12-17 02:14:11	@ubergeek	In hindsight, not the brightest of moves.

2018-12-17 18:13:00	mhj	That's good!
2018-12-17 18:16:46	mhj	I'm still fooling around with stuff right now.

2018-12-17 18:20:36	mhj	yo mushmouth

2018-12-17 18:38:37	@ubergeek	Programmatically creating stuff yet?
2018-12-17 18:44:52	jan6	13:38:37           @ubergeek | Programmatically creating stuff yet?
2018-12-17 18:45:03	jan6	make a program that programs other programs, then we'll talk
2018-12-17 18:46:44	@ubergeek	I did a couple of those in redcode back in the day
2018-12-17 18:46:54	@ubergeek	replicators was the term for them, if I recall :)
2018-12-17 19:29:11	khuxkm|lounge	i have a python module to make programs
2018-12-17 19:29:36	khuxkm|lounge	I used it to build a Brainfuck -> Python compiler
2018-12-17 19:40:25	mhj	Oh sorry, was away. Not really programming anything right now
2018-12-17 20:08:43	jan6	make a BrainFuck to APL compiler, lol
2018-12-17 20:08:49	jan6	and then the reverse
2018-12-17 20:09:11	jan6	both just look like nonsense
2018-12-17 20:41:34	khuxkm|lounge	so what you're saying is bug selfsame to teach me APL? :P
2018-12-17 20:51:36	mushmouth	sorry was messing with my older machines
2018-12-17 20:52:43	mushmouth	i need to make one into a linux server with sata hdd and see how well it handles
2018-12-17 20:53:32	jan6	make it into a tilde just cause why not ;P
2018-12-17 20:53:44	mushmouth	uh
2018-12-17 20:53:55	mushmouth	15/5 and that "tilde" would drain my bandwidth easily
2018-12-17 20:54:01	mushmouth	im on dsl

2018-12-18 00:15:03	~deepend	mushmouth: tilde doesn't really use much bandwidth
2018-12-18 00:15:40	~deepend	until you have a couple hundred regular users youd have tons of bandwidth for the average tilde
2018-12-18 00:20:35	@ubergeek	I was trying to explain to some folks that I'm trying to help get their pubnix off the ground that bandwidth isn't a super large concern
2018-12-18 00:21:11	@ubergeek	but I've been shopping around for a baremetal box that isn't too expensive, anyways.
2018-12-18 00:21:18	@ubergeek	Mainly, using that as an excuse to get one hahaha
2018-12-18 00:21:27	@ubergeek	and evening all.
2018-12-18 00:21:38	@ubergeek	Howsit going in your neck of the woods deepend
2018-12-18 00:21:59	~deepend	what kind of bare metel box you looking for'
2018-12-18 00:22:33	~deepend	ubergeek: good.. baby is home as of this afternoon :)  finally home.. was a long time coming
2018-12-18 00:22:42	@ubergeek	awesome news :)
2018-12-18 00:23:13	@ubergeek	I dunno, tbh.  Thinking in the neighborhood of 16GB of RAM, and maybe a 750GB or a TB set of drives
2018-12-18 00:24:51	~deepend	nice nice. looking for the machine or leasing one like we all seem to do these days
2018-12-18 00:26:29	~deepend	i really should get some sort of network traffic monitoring for my main server.. just so I can seperate out what machine is using the bandwidth.. right now I am relying on just what OVH has for monitoring 
2018-12-18 00:32:31	@ubergeek	how much monthly bandwidth total are you using?
2018-12-18 00:40:41	mhj	Heyo, back. Using the latest in tech, an eee pc
2018-12-18 00:40:46	mhj	;)
2018-12-18 00:45:53	@ubergeek	nice
2018-12-18 00:46:04	@ubergeek	I take it battery doesn't last, though?
2018-12-18 00:47:10	mhj	nope, I've had it forever lol
2018-12-18 00:56:46	@ubergeek	wow
2018-12-18 01:09:45	mhj	Yeah, I keep my computers around as long as possible haha
2018-12-18 01:14:33	~deepend	no idea how much bandwidth I'm using right now total.. but I know the average usage is pretty low.. way below the 250Mbit/s that the server is allowed to use
2018-12-18 01:14:33	@TildeBot	no u infinity deepend
2018-12-18 01:15:28	@ubergeek	that sounds about right, given everything you do there
2018-12-18 01:17:10	~deepend	upstream I'm using at most 2M bps
2018-12-18 01:18:03	~deepend	so right now not a lot.. and thats all the servers I run total.. not just the tilde
2018-12-18 01:18:25	~deepend	but what that works out into in total. MB or GB usage who knows.. they dont track it'
2018-12-18 01:19:17	~deepend	so just under 2Mbit upstream most times.. and only spikes once in awhile
2018-12-18 01:20:39	~deepend	I think the upstream only peaks when the server does its daily backups
2018-12-18 01:20:48	@ubergeek	that would do it too lol.
2018-12-18 01:21:34	~deepend	99% its under 1Mbit
2018-12-18 01:21:55	mhj	You need to torrent games on this server deepend 
2018-12-18 01:22:15	mhj	you can finally use the bandwith then :D
2018-12-18 01:24:31	~deepend	nah I'm good.. lol 
2018-12-18 01:24:43	~deepend	 good way to get the server suspended
2018-12-18 01:24:45	~deepend	lol
2018-12-18 01:28:52	mhj	It's ok, just run the server over i2p or tor ;D
2018-12-18 01:29:10	mhj	Then you only have to worry about the Canadian FBI
2018-12-18 01:29:11	~deepend	still never guarantee for people to not figure it out 
2018-12-18 01:29:37	mhj	seriously tho, what's up
2018-12-18 01:31:01	~deepend	not a whole bunch.. baby just came home today.. so been busy with all that :D 
2018-12-18 01:32:33	@ubergeek	tor is also a good way to limit bandwidth to your server haha
2018-12-18 01:32:48	@ubergeek	I'm super glad to hear the lil'un is home now
2018-12-18 01:40:54	mhj	I'm at home and we're watching the food network, it's like wow
2018-12-18 01:41:17	mhj	They're talking about fruitcake lol
2018-12-18 02:01:44	mhj	rawr, deepend! I've been playing Smash Bros Ultimate, and am gonna start Celeste!
2018-12-18 02:08:03	~deepend	noice.

2018-12-18 02:14:43	@ubergeek	yeah, they're on my short list with vps-mart
2018-12-18 02:15:35	@ubergeek	I like both because neither has "instant spin up", which is a sure-fire sign they are used for abuse
2018-12-18 02:21:02	ben	haven't heard of vps-mart
2018-12-18 02:23:22	@ubergeek	they are out of TX
2018-12-18 02:23:35	@ubergeek	and been around for a bit too, 2005
2018-12-18 02:51:25	~deepend	looking at dedi at vps-mart?   
2018-12-18 02:53:33	ben	oh uh
2018-12-18 02:53:52	~deepend	because I hate to pimp what I use. but I do it a ton.. if you looking for dedi.. soyoustart.com..  47.99 for 4core/8thread xeon with 32GB ram and 3x2TB hard drives.  or 2x480GB SSD

2018-12-18 21:59:58	@mushmouth	i mean if i love gopher so much i should love tabs
2018-12-18 22:00:10	@mushmouth	but honestly i hate when stuff gets really ident or space heavy
2018-12-18 22:09:11	@ubergeek	But, if they are tabs, you can change tabstops to look like whatever you want.  Spaces?  Not so much
2018-12-18 22:10:06	@mushmouth	i don't like tabs or spaces at all
2018-12-18 22:10:22	@ubergeek	so, change your tabstops to 0 :)
