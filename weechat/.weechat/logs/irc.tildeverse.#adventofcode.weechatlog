2018-12-03 18:16:14	@ben	should be 11 pm for you
2018-12-03 18:16:19	@ben	they come out 12 am eastern
2018-12-03 18:16:49	aewens	Well, I'm usually asleep around 11pm (local), so I guess I'm at an uphill battle here xD
2018-12-03 18:16:57	@ben	stay up for it
2018-12-03 18:17:01	@ben	that's not that late
2018-12-03 18:18:49	aewens	Sure, I just needed to wake up earlier since my wife's car is being worked on.
2018-12-03 18:21:15	@ben	heh that's fair
2018-12-03 19:05:09	@khuxkm|lounge	my problem is that staying up 'til midnight is bad since I'd have to do it on my phone :P
2018-12-03 19:13:05	aewens	I mean, while the problems require a bit of thought they don't require a lot of code to get it working. Plus, we live in the https://repl.it/ world where you can do coding on your phone in many languages.
2018-12-03 19:16:29	@khuxkm|lounge	I was referring to the tiny keyboard

2018-12-04 14:48:09	@ben	it's 42 what are you talking about
2018-12-04 16:01:34	aewens	That reminds me, for part 2 on day 1, how long did it take your programs to finish calculating it?
2018-12-04 16:02:07	aewens	Because mine took about 6 minutes to finish. Partially because Python, partially because I probably did it inefficiently
2018-12-04 16:06:12	@ben	about the same i think
2018-12-04 16:06:22	@ben	i finished it and moved on
2018-12-04 16:06:41	@ben	there's a solution with something-something intervals
2018-12-04 16:06:45	@ben	but i didn't bother
2018-12-04 16:07:08	aewens	Yeah, I was just curious if anyone else experienced the long runtime or if my solution just really sucked that day
2018-12-04 16:08:14	@ben	naive solution is slwo yea
2018-12-04 16:08:32	@ben	my day 2 is real quick
2018-12-04 16:08:59	aewens	I didn't have any slowness in the rest of my solutions, just part 2 of day 1.
2018-12-04 16:09:27	aewens	I *almost* did in day 4 part 1, but I used some quick memoization to speed it up

2018-12-05 06:08:57	fosslinux	to install it

2018-12-05 06:12:43	aewens	Well, it looks like about 3-4 minutes instead of 13-15 minutes

2018-12-05 06:14:38	slipyx	weird, pypy took 20s
2018-12-05 06:14:55	slipyx	guess its better to use normal py for string intensive stuff
2018-12-05 06:15:09	fosslinux	woah what a suprise
2018-12-05 06:15:12	aewens	I'm also probably doing this the most inefficient way possible
2018-12-05 06:17:39	slipyx	though pypy has about 25x slower startup time than normiepy
2018-12-05 06:18:30	fosslinux	i think normiepy is cpython
2018-12-05 06:20:48	aewens	I tried to make it run faster. Ran in about 2s but got a wrong answer. Hmm
2018-12-05 06:27:16	slipyx	protip: remember to rstrip the input, theres a stray newline

2018-12-05 07:14:22	aewens	Now I need to let part 2 run, which is taking 5ever
2018-12-05 07:14:56	ben	mine's about 1 second
2018-12-05 07:16:28	aewens	The main reason mine is slow is because I'm moving 2 at a time. At least how I read the problem, that's what we should be doing?
2018-12-05 07:19:51	ben	2 at at time?
2018-12-05 07:19:54	ben	nah
2018-12-05 07:20:59	aewens	In the example it showed that if you had cCc, it would result in c. I guess I could just have it move one head after a match to make sure it doesn't match both cC and Cc.
2018-12-05 07:21:52	ben	just iterate the alphabet, replacing lowercase-uppercase pairs until there's nothing left to replace
2018-12-05 07:22:16	ben	oh wait that's part 1
2018-12-05 07:22:46	slipyx	i had to functionize my part 1 so i could use it for part2
2018-12-05 07:23:01	ben	well part 2 you just iterate a..z once, remove all occurences of each letter, and run the part1 algo
2018-12-05 07:23:37	ben	find the smallest one, grab the strlen
2018-12-05 07:29:47	aewens	Just realized why it didn't work the first time. Used max instead of min.
2018-12-05 07:29:51	 *	aewens facepalms
2018-12-05 07:30:39	aewens	Also, I tried not going 2 at a time to speed it up, but it got the wrong result for part 1 so I just set it back because I'm too tired to try and reason with it.
2018-12-05 07:31:48	ben	lol that's fair
2018-12-05 07:31:55	ben	slep and try again tmrw
2018-12-05 07:39:30	aewens	The slow version is on X, so I'm gonna wait it out
2018-12-05 07:39:52	slipyx	the answer is Z
2018-12-05 07:40:07	slipyx	thats what mine was actually lol
2018-12-05 07:42:11	aewens	I'm now #5 on the leaderboard. Making my way up.
2018-12-05 07:42:25	aewens	Okay, I'm done and I'm tired. Night everyone. Happy hacking
2018-12-05 07:43:27	ben	night!
2018-12-05 14:49:52	aewens	Day 2 of trying to stay up late to do AoC: I'm feel like I've been hit by a train and feel the constant pull towards the depths of slumber
2018-12-05 15:19:52	ben	that's me every day rip
2018-12-05 16:49:40	aewens	Something to note: Sleeping on a problem did wonders. I have a solution in python works and only takes half a second to run now
2018-12-05 16:49:57	ben	frik yea
2018-12-05 16:50:28	aewens	Now to get part 2 to run fast, which should be sups easy now
2018-12-05 16:52:37	ben	it's basically just running part1 with each letter of the alphabet stripped out
2018-12-05 16:53:02	ben	then finding min lenght
2018-12-05 16:53:36	aewens	Sure, I just needed to turn my solver into a function instead of just a while loop
2018-12-05 16:54:11	ben	yup!
2018-12-05 17:02:36	aewens	Got it working. That was a hell of a lot simpler than whatever madness I was trying last night.
2018-12-05 17:02:50	aewens	Kids, don't be drowsy and code
2018-12-05 17:04:51	ben	lol i do that all the time though
2018-12-05 17:04:56	ben	when am i not drowsy
2018-12-05 17:05:53	aewens	I do my best work when I'm sharp and alert, or when I'm freshly hacked up on coffee. When I'm tired, my laziness leaks into my coding.
2018-12-05 17:07:49	ben	for sure

2018-12-07 05:56:10	aewens	Yeah, there's a distinct different between the two
2018-12-07 06:42:59	slipyx	guess its a good idea to recreate the example's input and solution before submitting anything :|
2018-12-07 07:20:43	aewens	That's what I started doing since day 6. Just finished day 7.

2018-12-11 05:23:53	ben	297x297?
2018-12-11 05:24:37	ben	i was just going to iterate 0..297 for x and y, sum the 3x3, then find the max?
