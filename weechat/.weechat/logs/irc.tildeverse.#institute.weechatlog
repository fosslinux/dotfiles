2018-12-05 13:34:40	login	is there any way i can help migrate botany to use setuid?

2018-12-05 17:01:21	login	i thought the differentiation would be nice...

2018-12-05 17:03:27	login	"tilde.town's botany and tilde.institute's botany are slightly different" would have been nicer...
2018-12-05 17:05:17	ben	is one newer?
2018-12-05 18:04:21	~ahriman	i got botany from the repo itself
2018-12-05 18:51:09	login	none are newer than the other. i don't know if the repo and town are the same version... my idea was more akin to forking the repo and making a set of very small changes that made setuid protect .botanys from being modified (but still keeping them readable)
2018-12-05 18:51:46	login	(but people would lose the ability to make them non-readable from outside the botany-ui (not that one can make them non-readable from inside the botany-ui currently)
2018-12-05 18:53:15	ben	why though
2018-12-05 18:53:18	ben	what do you gain
2018-12-05 19:01:43	login	One gains integrity in one's botany achievements...
2018-12-05 19:01:59	login	One can be sure they were not gamed (other than by the one whose setuid it is)
2018-12-05 19:02:40	login	And, if it were done on tilde.town, I would look into how botany scores can be used get tcoins etc...
2018-12-05 19:03:22	login	Perhaps sum over all plants, of total scores per plant
2018-12-05 19:03:43	login	Or maybe something related to the current generation...
2018-12-05 19:26:30	~ahriman	I just don't see the point to expend that effort to protect the integrity of .botany when i'm not worried about people modifying their gardening data. feel free to ask vilmibm if you can do it with ~town though since youre looking to integrate tcoin into it, that's a cool idea, tcoins from botany scores
2018-12-05 20:16:40	login	but curiouser has ownershp of botany, and has expressed an interest in moving the .botany to the database too...
2018-12-05 20:17:00	login	the database that holds the gardens currently...
2018-12-05 20:17:25	login	But it was just that tilde.institute was a new place, so there was an opportunity to do it different...
2018-12-05 20:17:44	login	i've modified my gardening data in the past to revive them, and know at least one other person who has done the same...
2018-12-05 20:18:25	login	i mean, i didn't integrate tcoin with botany because of the "modified garden data" thing, so i thought that that restriciton shouldn't exist if there is another chance to deploy .botany

2018-12-06 03:53:44	login	I mean, the program would have to be plugged of any serious security holes...
2018-12-06 03:54:14	login	But yeah, perhaps a separete user for botany would be a better way to isolate the suid stuff
2018-12-06 03:54:39	login	i mean, even if someone gains access, the most they'd do is modify or spoil botany for everyone...
2018-12-06 03:54:52	login	I mean, even the botany garden database is 777 right?
2018-12-06 03:55:08	login	(or perhaps 770 with group ownership of 'town')
2018-12-06 03:56:14	ben	where do you come up with these scenarios
2018-12-06 03:56:33	ben	someone gaining access to the system isn't gonna care about anything of the sort
2018-12-06 03:56:47	ben	that's below last on their list of exploitable things

2018-12-06 05:15:39	~ahriman	haha
2018-12-06 05:16:49	~ahriman	the suid bit would increase the attack surface with whats a game not designed with security in mind. suid + no focus on security in the first place = drop a root shell
2018-12-06 05:17:26	~ahriman	im not taking that chance
2018-12-06 05:17:48	~ahriman	proven software like gnupg can be suid, or system binaries that need it, because suid is serious
2018-12-06 05:18:19	~ahriman	the entirety of botany would have to be reworked to drop to a botany user and im not doing that
2018-12-06 05:19:06	~ahriman	gnupg only gets it so it can lock memory pages
2018-12-06 05:19:13	~ahriman	then drops root
2018-12-06 05:19:31	~ahriman	theres no reason for a gardening game to have the suid bit set
2018-12-06 05:21:40	xvetrd	but plants need root access
2018-12-06 05:22:04	xvetrd	or the water does i guess

2018-12-06 17:08:42	login	i would be against that 100%
2018-12-06 17:10:04	login	usually it's used to get root, but in this case, setuid would not be used to get root...
2018-12-06 17:10:15	login	It would essentially be the same thing that tcoin and da both do on tilde.town
2018-12-06 17:11:05	login	I mean, holodeck on tilde.team uses setuid, and that worked out fine...
2018-12-06 17:12:13	login	the gardening game does not require root access, it requires suid where the "owner" of the executable is not root, but a normal user
2018-12-06 17:12:34	login	So the suid wouldn't allow the executable to assume root, but to assume that normal user
2018-12-06 17:13:03	login	I mean, I think there is a misunderstanding here regarding what i was proposing...

2018-12-07 00:30:26	login	I didn't know why the opposition against botany suid was so high, until I understood that there was a misunderstanding...
2018-12-07 00:31:48	login	I can see how it can raise additional challenges to modify botany and merge changes that will be made downstream... and the fact that python is vulnerable to environment variables being changed etc., so a suid could potentially give unauthorized access to the owner of the executable (not root, but whichever user)
2018-12-07 00:32:12	login	I mean, if you can hack holodeck on tilde.team, you can access login@tilde.team freely...

2018-12-08 20:59:14	desvox	i just saw this pop up in my irc client
2018-12-08 20:59:38	~ahriman	yeah im writing skoolbot from scratch to help my python knowledge so im testing in here

2018-12-08 21:00:38	desvox	yeah i know that feeling
2018-12-08 21:00:50	desvox	irc bots are great for that
2018-12-08 21:01:29	~ahriman	i was advised to use a wrapper for the irc protocol but i want to work with raw sockets for the practice
2018-12-08 21:01:36	~ahriman	at least right now
2018-12-08 21:02:01	desvox	yeah im all about that life
2018-12-08 21:02:06	desvox	never used an irc library tbh
2018-12-08 21:02:17	~ahriman	w0rd! it's fun doing it from scratch
2018-12-08 21:02:34	~ahriman	im running it from ~team so no need to manage ssl
2018-12-08 21:02:41	desvox	ive also implemented telegram's bot api and youtube's account management api from scratch too
2018-12-08 21:02:52	~ahriman	oh hell yes, noice desvox
2018-12-08 21:02:53	desvox	telegram is stupid easy
2018-12-08 21:02:58	desvox	youtube kinda stresses me out
2018-12-08 21:03:09	desvox	also ssl is easy to do on python
2018-12-08 21:03:37	desvox	actually its easy even on common lisp but scrapping together knowledge on how it worked wasnt so quick
2018-12-08 21:03:43	~ahriman	oh it is? i'll look into it tonight. if i can get ssl working I can run it from ~inst and add things like load, who, etc
2018-12-08 21:04:06	desvox	pretty sure its something roughly as easy as import ssl, ssl.wrap(irc_socket)
2018-12-08 21:04:12	~ahriman	oh jeebus
2018-12-08 21:04:36	~ahriman	ill def do that tonight, or maybe when i get out of the shower. speaking of, brb getting ready for work

2018-12-11 01:59:05	ben	no
2018-12-11 01:59:11	login	I mean, imagine _login_, _ben_, _rnelson_
2018-12-11 01:59:18	login	compared to
2018-12-11 01:59:27	ben	what about 1_login
2018-12-11 01:59:33	login	something like 1-login, 2-ben, 3-rnelson
2018-12-11 01:59:36	login	1_login doesn't ping
2018-12-11 01:59:43	ben	i prefer underscore to dash for that

2018-12-12 03:20:49	~ahriman	afaik suid is only for binaries
2018-12-12 03:21:14	~ahriman	if you wanted to write holodeck in C it could be suid'ed
2018-12-12 03:21:39	~ahriman	i'd have to suid the python interpreter and that's ... no

2018-12-12 18:43:45	~ahriman	way fucking better than yairc and all the other ones i tried
2018-12-12 18:45:31	ben	srsly
2018-12-12 19:59:46	login	ahriman: you can write a C wrapper that execve's the Python interpreter (in isolated mode) with hardcoded holodeck python-file path
2018-12-12 19:59:53	login	then compile said C wrapper, and suid that
2018-12-12 20:00:02	login	That's how i was able to get it done on tilde.team
2018-12-12 20:10:10	ben	why though
2018-12-12 20:10:19	ben	seems like a Bad Idea
2018-12-12 20:12:11	arne	suid
2018-12-12 21:20:42	login	Why does it seem like a bad idea?
2018-12-12 21:21:02	login	I mean, it's hard to keep the Python environment untamperable
2018-12-12 21:21:58	login	But "isolated mode" was supposed to move towards this ideal...
2018-12-12 21:22:00	login	The python command has a new option, -I, which causes it to run in “isolated mode”, which means that sys.path contains neither the script’s directory nor the user’s site-packages directory, and all PYTHON* environment variables are ignored (it implies both -s and -E). Other restrictions may also be applied in the future, with the goal being to isolate the execution of a script from
2018-12-12 21:22:03	login	the user’s environment. This is appropriate, for example, when Python is used to run a system script. On most POSIX systems it can and should be used in the #! line of system scripts.
2018-12-12 21:23:02	login	So on tilde.team, ben, I made the holodeck python compatible with Python 3.4 (had to change a lot of print statements), made the hashbang have the isolated option, and in the C-wrapper for holodeck, made it process-overlay the python interpreter in isolated mode
2018-12-12 21:24:45	login	If Python's isolated mode is not perfect, and if sys.path's used for imports has a path corresponding to a world-editable file, then it can be hijacked
2018-12-12 21:24:48	login	otherwise, it's safe
2018-12-12 21:24:52	login	from other users
2018-12-12 21:25:19	login	ben: tilde.team's holodeck already uses this idea... and the maximum that can happen is someone gets to do anything they want as "login"
2018-12-12 21:25:23	login	(as my user)
2018-12-12 22:35:31	ben	what problem are you trying to solve? and why do you want that security hole on your account
2018-12-13 02:12:44	-->	xvetrd (xvetrd@tilde.institute) has joined #institute
2018-12-13 03:49:02	login	ben: the problem i was trying to solve was of holodeck not relying on a 777 permissioned database to function...
2018-12-13 03:49:47	ben	why would you need that anyways
2018-12-13 03:49:56	login	(nothing regarding locks or data races when multiple users are modifying the same database is considered in the holodeck python script, but i'm assuming sqlite handles it
2018-12-13 03:50:16	login	holodeck is shared, so the same database would need to be modifiable by everyone...
2018-12-13 03:50:35	login	A better solution would be to have a "holodeck server" and "holodeck client"
2018-12-13 03:50:52	ben	i think it's reasonable to have that for this situation
2018-12-13 03:51:15	ben	you're thinking of threat profiles that don't exist for this type of system
2018-12-13 03:51:16	login	Yeah, but that would require making a thin client and working to make the holodeck python script work "remotely"
2018-12-13 03:51:34	login	My threat profile only included people modifying the database from outside holodeck...
2018-12-13 03:51:42	login	You know, joke-deleting everything etc...
2018-12-13 03:51:54	ben	setuid does not prevent joke-deleting
2018-12-13 03:52:00	login	Or modifying what other people already wrote (which the holodeck script doesn't allow)
2018-12-13 03:52:15	login	if setuid were to exist, how would one joke-delete the holodeck database?
2018-12-13 03:52:46	ben	it runs as the owner's user so you have write permissions
2018-12-13 03:53:00	login	But the script itself doesn't allow deleting...
2018-12-13 03:53:01	ben	i don't understand how that helps
2018-12-13 03:53:24	ben	i think you're still going too far for a problem that does not exist
2018-12-13 03:53:28	login	So even though the "script" and therefore the "owner" has write permissions, there is nothing in the "script" that calls "delete" in the sql query...
2018-12-13 03:54:02	login	I think an impediment like setuid would disaude better than having a 777 database
2018-12-13 03:54:23	ben	still opens a huge security hole for a non-problem
2018-12-13 03:54:27	login	Even though the former might make it seem more secure than it is, the latter will be much much easier to "joke-delete" or even "replace data"
2018-12-13 03:54:51	login	ben: if a separate user could be created for holodeck, then the only security hole opened is being able to joke-delete the holodeck database
2018-12-13 03:55:02	login	or do other things normal users are allowed to do, but from the "holodeck user"
2018-12-13 03:55:29	ben	whatever
2018-12-13 03:55:34	ben	it's still not worth the effort
2018-12-13 03:55:35	login	In the currently live implementation, the security hole opened is having unrestricted access to ~login on tilde.team, which is not ideal, but i don't think it'll happen without some effort...
2018-12-13 03:55:40	ben	no threat profile for this
2018-12-13 03:56:19	login	I think holodeck database being joke-deleted would be an incredible loss, especially if a lot of people put a lot of effort into building the holodeck world out...
2018-12-13 03:56:32	login	It's like writo being joke deleted, for example
2018-12-13 03:56:51	ben	what's writo
2018-12-13 03:57:02	login	A shared ascii drawing world on tilde.town
2018-12-13 03:57:11	ben	ah i haven't heard of it
2018-12-13 03:57:18	login	I made an "html viewer" for it...

2018-12-13 03:59:16	login	Oh, it's hourly
2018-12-13 04:00:13	login	I just don't want holodeck to be subject to the same "delete", especially when the script itself doesn't have a "delete" or "modify" thing
2018-12-13 04:00:27	login	so on tilde.team, it's harder to delete or modify holodeck than other places...
2018-12-13 04:00:30	login	.
2018-12-13 04:00:33	login	I could also do the server thing instead....
2018-12-13 04:00:42	ben	i think that's the optimal solution
2018-12-13 04:02:35	login	For example, "chin" on tilde.town is just a python script that I used "tui" (i can't find the github now, but modified source code is available at ~login/bin/src/tui/tui.cpp on tilde.town)
2018-12-13 04:03:08	login	and a thin client (just socat) with
2018-12-13 04:03:37	login	.
2018-12-13 04:04:00	login	I mean, if you get arbitrary code execution on the server using malformed messages from the client, it's just as dangerous as setuid
2018-12-13 04:04:37	login	So I don't see how having a "server" is a lot different from setuid... espcially when server and client are on the same machine...
2018-12-13 04:05:13	login	I mean, the only thing that changes is that stdin and stdout don't go "directly", but through a "network" that goes from one port on 127.0.0.1 to another port on 127.0.0.1
2018-12-13 04:07:01	login	I mean, if anybody hacks holodeck on tilde.team to get arbitrary access to ~login on tilde.town, please leave a text file with a message about it, and i'll see what kind of monetary compensation i can come up with (it'll be more than 0 guaranteed)
2018-12-13 04:07:20	login	I'll mine monero for that person, let's say

2018-12-17 21:12:16	aewens	Am I missing something with `holodeck` or is the world empty with no way to add anything?
2018-12-17 21:14:55	ben	might not be writable?
2018-12-17 21:15:10	ben	login did some weird shit with suid permissions to prevent tampering?
2018-12-17 21:15:22	ben	might be preventing all play lol
2018-12-17 21:16:04	aewens	The problem is that there's supposed to be some seed world there. If you type `look` into it without an argument it says there should be something to look at, and from there things to describe and go to.
2018-12-17 21:16:20	ben	idk i'm really not that familiar with it
2018-12-17 21:16:48	aewens	For new rooms you can add things, but it looks like if there's an empty world to begin there's nothing to branch off from?

2018-12-18 06:32:56	login	possibly even change holodeck owner to _holodeck to keep things segregated (in this case, ahriman would need sudo to reset the holodeck.db)
