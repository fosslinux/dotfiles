2018-11-13 07:32:17	SinaCutie	What language? :D

2018-11-13 07:33:50	SinaCutie	lmao
2018-11-13 07:34:00	fosslinux	is there a reason i shouldn't be using import socket?
2018-11-13 07:34:26	slipyx	imo, python 3's async.protocol is a lot easier
2018-11-13 07:34:29	SinaCutie	There isn't a reason you should or shouldn't. :D That tutorial is just not letting you use existing irc packages, which for learning, I think is a good way to go.
2018-11-13 07:35:05	fosslinux	apparently that's what aewens used for balibibot

2018-11-13 23:18:12	giacomo	hi guys... what happened?
2018-11-13 23:18:59	giacomo	just curious... 
2018-11-13 23:19:09	aewens	fosslinux happened.
2018-11-13 23:19:39	aewens	He did a netscan that made the VPS vendor, Hetzner, get all fussy since it violates their terms of service.
2018-11-13 23:19:44	dokuja	yay back
2018-11-13 23:20:00	aewens	The commands that caused this has since been uninstalled from the system to prevent repeats
2018-11-13 23:20:10	~ben	1) it's not a vps
2018-11-13 23:20:16	~ben	2) it was a localhost scan
2018-11-13 23:20:54	~ben	3) hetzner's network is weird and for some reason sends unroutable packets to the default gateway
2018-11-13 23:21:00	aewens	Okay, the hardware vendor then. And it was a netscan, just not for external IPs
2018-11-13 23:21:42	~ben	4) they thought something was netscanning from this ip
2018-11-13 23:22:19	giacomo	hum... actually a netscan on local host could have been something I'd do to check if a port is up
2018-11-13 23:22:47	giacomo	I mean... it's something I do on my machines during trubleshotting
2018-11-13 23:23:19	@khuxkm|lounge	but that's your machines, your network
2018-11-13 23:23:22	~ben	yeah.. i'm fairly certain it wasn't malicious
2018-11-13 23:23:30	@khuxkm|lounge	this is their weird, misconfigured network
2018-11-13 23:23:33	@khuxkm|lounge	and their machines
2018-11-13 23:23:38	~ben	but still it's generally a good idea to check with the sysadmin before running nmap
2018-11-13 23:23:40	@khuxkm|lounge	not to mention the correct tool is netstat
2018-11-13 23:23:43	@khuxkm|lounge	:P
2018-11-13 23:23:46	~ben	curl ipinfo.io 
2018-11-13 23:23:48	~ben	done
2018-11-13 23:23:56	~ben	or dig +short tilde.team
2018-11-13 23:24:25	giacomo	mmm... yes... but... hum... maybe write this on the welcome text...
2018-11-13 23:25:13	aewens	fosslinux did this from a container on the system, to the best of our knowledge no one has done this on ~team proper.
2018-11-13 23:25:22	giacomo	I mean... I'm VERY used to do such things... yes they could be maliciuous, but... honestly one year from now, I could totally forget and do it anyway...
2018-11-13 23:27:37	giacomo	aewens: uhm... what's the architecture on this shared machine?
2018-11-13 23:27:59	giacomo	I mean we are each into separated containers?
2018-11-13 23:29:18	aewens	Nah, the containers are something ben spins up for users upon request.
2018-11-13 23:29:38	aewens	We are all on an Ubuntu Server that has a few stray LXD containers lying around it.
2018-11-13 23:31:38	giacomo	it's interesting that at least tilde.zone remained functional otherwise there would be no way to annoy ben :-D
2018-11-13 23:32:14	~ben	giacomo: i'm writing up a post-mortem right now
2018-11-13 23:32:24	~ben	but it has to do with the fact that it was only the primary ip that was blocked
2018-11-13 23:32:33	~ben	ipv6 was still functioning just fine
2018-11-13 23:32:42	~ben	which is what mastodon defaults to
2018-11-13 23:33:01	~ben	nothing actually went down, it was just inaccessible
2018-11-13 23:33:15	aewens	Locally up, globally down
2018-11-13 23:36:26	~ben	mhm :(
2018-11-13 23:36:50	giacomo	ben: I got it... I didn't though about ipv6
2018-11-13 23:37:14	~ben	what about it? the host only locked the primary ipv4 address
2018-11-13 23:37:31	giacomo	ben: this is the exciting life of a sysadmin! :-D
2018-11-13 23:37:36	~ben	seriously
2018-11-13 23:37:43	~ben	kinda derailed my whole day at work
2018-11-13 23:37:48	~ben	but that's fine
2018-11-13 23:38:59	giacomo	well as a user... thanks. :-)
2018-11-13 23:40:11	~ben	lol sure thing
2018-11-13 23:40:19	~ben	i was missing it too cause it's my primary email address!
2018-11-13 23:40:22	@khuxkm|lounge	as a volunteer sysadmin this scared the everloving shit out of me
2018-11-13 23:40:26	@khuxkm|lounge	ben: same
2018-11-13 23:40:50	~ben	as soon as i figured out what it was i calmed down significantly
2018-11-13 23:41:12	@khuxkm|lounge	I was grounded for the better part of today
2018-11-13 23:41:15	@khuxkm|lounge	so no communication
2018-11-13 23:41:30	~ben	oh rip
2018-11-13 23:41:35	@khuxkm|lounge	even if I could use public thelounge (as in, the demo instance) to connect in
2018-11-13 23:41:37	@khuxkm|lounge	I had no devices
2018-11-13 23:41:54	@khuxkm|lounge	I found these things out in classes where they let me use school computers
2018-11-13 23:41:58	~ben	the worst part was that the primary email on the hetzner account was my #tilde.team address
2018-11-13 23:42:13	@khuxkm|lounge	oh fuck
2018-11-13 23:42:16	~ben	ended up forwarding it to my gmail and dealing with it from there
2018-11-13 23:42:42	~ben	and changing the primary address on my hetzner acct
2018-11-13 23:44:32	giacomo	I think these things might happen... it could have been worse actually... there is a lot of reciprocal trust in something like tilde.chat and it's not just trust in people but in their skills
2018-11-13 23:45:42	giacomo	a noob could actually try to scan the network without thinking about it...
2018-11-13 23:45:59	~ben	yeah for sure
2018-11-13 23:46:08	~ben	i think that's pretty much what happened
2018-11-13 23:46:15	giacomo	so maybe removing nmap is actually a good idea :-)
2018-11-13 23:46:18	~ben	yeah it's gone
2018-11-13 23:46:20	~ben	:P
2018-11-13 23:46:58	~ben	it's also partially hetzner's weird network setup
2018-11-13 23:47:09	~ben	10/8 shouldn't end up at the gateway
2018-11-13 23:47:09	giacomo	this doesn't protect against badass that could build it from sources... but at least (should) reduce the risk of errors
2018-11-13 23:47:16	~ben	yeah exactly
2018-11-13 23:47:20	giacomo	(I mean, like my own :-D)
2018-11-13 23:47:37	~ben	if you really wanted to, you could just run the connect(8) syscall as it does in nmap
2018-11-13 23:47:54	~ben	the easiest way to get the ip is to just ask dns
2018-11-13 23:47:54	giacomo	indeed
2018-11-13 23:47:57	~ben	that's what it's for
2018-11-13 23:48:26	~ben	and these queries were only going out on 80 and 443
2018-11-13 23:48:36	giacomo	well, I usually use nmap to troubleshot ports...
2018-11-13 23:48:52	~ben	it's not something i can block reasonably
2018-11-13 23:49:00	~ben	oh yeah i do too
2018-11-13 23:49:23	~ben	but apparently it's relatively easy to trick the host into thinking it's a netscan "attack"
2018-11-13 23:49:47	~ben	i'm going to be looking into redundancy
2018-11-13 23:50:26	deepend	redundancy is always good.. redundancy for all services or just certain services? :D 
2018-11-13 23:54:44	~ben	at least irc
2018-11-13 23:54:48	~ben	i'm not sure about the rest
2018-11-13 23:55:00	~ben	is your.tilde.chat accessible externally deepend ?
2018-11-13 23:55:37	deepend	yes. on an odd port.. probably should open the right port 
2018-11-13 23:56:03	deepend	odd port for ssl and i also have 6667 open since I like to use my older machines on irc as well.. which dont support ssl
2018-11-13 23:56:29	deepend	7766 is what my ssl port I think is at the moment
2018-11-13 23:56:54	~ben	6697?
2018-11-13 23:57:04	~ben	6697 is the ssl port
2018-11-13 23:57:15	~ben	if you add that, i'll add it to the tilde.chat round robin
2018-11-13 23:57:54	~ben	ok i need to finish this post-mortem post
2018-11-14 00:00:17	deepend	ok.. will do that shortly.
2018-11-14 00:01:10	~ben	oh ok :)
2018-11-14 00:01:16	~ben	still writing the post-mortem

2018-11-14 00:29:39	@khuxkm|lounge	getting us in hot water with hetzner (our host)
2018-11-14 00:36:27	edwardthefma	O shit

2018-11-14 00:48:30	~ben	not that bad, just had to ask the right person in the right place, which i know now
2018-11-14 00:48:48	~ben	if i had asked in the right place originally, i think the downtime would have been minimal
2018-11-14 00:50:57	deepend	had someone use a script from the twtxt registry on my server to DDOS another server so they blocked an ip on my server.. only thing I had to do is acknowledge the problem.. ensure the server was fixed and then login to my control panel and click a button to unblock the ip.. ez pz.. no real interaction with the datacenter itself
2018-11-14 00:55:22	deepend	anyways.. enough about ovh for a day.. they should pay me.. lmao
2018-11-14 01:21:06	~ben	i think i just ended up responding to the wrong emails
2018-11-14 01:21:20	~ben	since it was sent to an address that was on the server whose ip they blocked
2018-11-14 01:21:51	~ben	if i had known the proper place to ask originally, it would have been minimal

2018-11-14 04:37:37	fosslinux	khuxkm|lounge: "fosslinux did an oops" beautiful, yes edwardthefma "i did an oops". tbh i'm not even sure why hetnzer has a problem with scanning 10/8 but anyway
2018-11-14 04:37:59	fosslinux	you've got to allow the host
2018-11-14 04:38:03	fosslinux	to do what they want
2018-11-14 04:40:48	edwardthefma	I think tilde team has one rule don't do any thing that fucks up the server or slows down the server for other users
2018-11-14 04:41:52	edwardthefma	Beaware of the laws of motion
2018-11-14 04:43:45	fosslinux	^^ thats our current tos afaik
2018-11-14 04:43:50	fosslinux	but um
2018-11-14 04:44:21	fosslinux	how are we meant to know what f***s up the server?
2018-11-14 04:44:28	fosslinux	i wasn't to know that nmap did
2018-11-14 04:44:36	fosslinux	so thats why we need a proper tos
2018-11-14 04:48:03	edwardthefma	Agreed but why did you do a command without knowing what it did
2018-11-14 04:49:46	edwardthefma	Next time you do a command you don't fully understand please research it
2018-11-14 04:50:24	edwardthefma	Or ask someone :) that 
2018-11-14 04:51:03	fosslinux	i did know what it did
2018-11-14 04:51:24	fosslinux	i knew perfectly well what it did

2018-11-14 04:51:59	fosslinux	oh i see what made you say that
2018-11-14 04:52:19	fosslinux	i meant i wasn't to know that nmap f***ed up the server

2018-11-14 14:52:02	@khuxkm|lounge	it's against Hetzner TOS to portscan

2018-11-15 20:25:53	tunas	First it's in Macedonian for you and English for me, now it's got the separators wrong?
2018-11-15 20:26:05	tunas	I swear I didn't tick any box to switch to English. It must've been a cookie from before xD
2018-11-15 20:26:44	tunas	ben: Keep in mind that they also say they'll license windows server for it.
2018-11-15 20:26:53	tunas	I leave it to you to judge whether that makes it worthwhile.

2018-11-15 20:27:06	~ben	i have darkreader.org on
2018-11-15 20:27:12	~ben	ew windows server
2018-11-15 20:27:44	tunas	Not like I'll use windows server, but the idiots here do.
2018-11-15 20:27:49	~ben	lol
2018-11-15 20:28:02	tunas	I get paid a good amount of money (by the living standard here) to migrate them to Linux.
2018-11-15 20:28:11	tunas	Thus saving them even more money on licensing.
2018-11-15 20:28:24	tunas	Now, not everyone using windows server is an idiot.
2018-11-15 20:28:31	tunas	These are just idiots that use windows server.
2018-11-15 20:28:34	amcclure[town]	oof

2018-11-15 20:35:06	tunas	Ha ha!
2018-11-15 20:35:19	tunas	...oh, it doesn't work that way.
2018-11-15 20:35:36	~ben	doesn't work which way?
2018-11-15 20:36:05	tunas	By directly referencing a file.
2018-11-15 20:36:07	~ben	ooh i like your little directory list
2018-11-15 20:36:09	~ben	https://tunas.tilde.team/
2018-11-15 20:36:25	tunas	Open player.php.
2018-11-15 20:36:38	~ben	you need /mods/ before TrackerModules
2018-11-15 20:36:45	tunas	Yeah, I noticed :P
2018-11-15 20:36:49	tunas	But there's also a player!
2018-11-15 20:36:57	~ben	owo that's dope
2018-11-15 20:37:06	~ben	i'll have another look when i get home
2018-11-15 20:37:13	~ben	just finishing up at work
2018-11-15 20:37:32	tunas	I stole the player from someone (without deleting the credit text.)
2018-11-15 20:37:39	tunas	I'm too lazy to write my own :P
2018-11-15 20:37:41	~ben	heh that's fine ;)
2018-11-15 20:37:42	tunas	(and too incompetent)
2018-11-15 20:38:13	~ben	just gotta do trial and error 
2018-11-15 20:38:15	~ben	with php
2018-11-15 20:38:18	~ben	save, reload, try again
2018-11-15 20:39:02	tunas	It now loads a file by default on startup.
2018-11-15 20:39:10	~ben	dope
2018-11-15 20:39:20	tunas	Because I find it's confusing for the user to find nothing loaded and have to hunt down the "load song" button.
2018-11-15 20:39:28	~ben	that's totally fair

2018-11-16 08:39:26	SinaCutie	Good morning :)
2018-11-16 08:39:31	SinaCutie	Rather, "hi"
2018-11-16 08:41:26	slipyx	buongiorno bello mio
2018-11-16 10:49:03	tunas	Hi slipyx, SinaCutie.
2018-11-16 10:49:11	tunas	I'm two hours late, but hey.
2018-11-16 10:49:32	SinaCutie	XD
2018-11-16 10:49:34	SinaCutie	How goes?
2018-11-16 11:18:20	tunas	It goes, it goes.
2018-11-16 11:18:25	tunas	It's Friday, thank god.
2018-11-16 11:26:46	SinaCutie	Hee
2018-11-16 11:26:54	SinaCutie	Yeah, I'm glad it's Friday
2018-11-16 11:34:42	tunas	Any weekend plans?
2018-11-16 11:42:58	SinaCutie	Relaxing and likely playing some games.
2018-11-16 11:43:10	SinaCutie	Though knowing me, I might say that and then end up programming.
2018-11-16 12:08:01	jan6	lol
2018-11-16 12:08:11	jan6	programming is a game too
2018-11-16 12:12:10	SinaCutie	Definitely.

2018-11-16 12:58:02	brendantcc_lounge	idk yet
2018-11-16 12:59:58	tunas	SinaCutie: How do you manage to intend to play a game and end up getting work done?
2018-11-16 13:00:09	SinaCutie	I love programming.
2018-11-16 13:00:10	tunas	For most people it's the opposite: sit down to code and end up playing a game...
2018-11-16 13:00:14	tunas	:P
2018-11-16 13:00:21	SinaCutie	And it's not "work" so much as my own projects.
2018-11-16 13:00:33	brendantcc_lounge	i've been working on a html profile page for my little bro
2018-11-16 13:00:35	tunas	I wanna get into programming, but school doesn't let me do anything beyond slooooooow learning of C++.
2018-11-16 13:00:50	brendantcc_lounge	so far i've done profiles for ben, tomasino, and a friend of mine
2018-11-16 13:01:02	SinaCutie	I find great enjoyment in programming, the same way as reading and playing games. Though it's much easier to open up a folder and start programming, than it is to load a game, sometimes. :)
2018-11-16 13:01:03	zyeri	is it actually C++ or is it "C++"?
2018-11-16 13:01:22	brendantcc_lounge	who knows zyeri
2018-11-16 13:01:22	tunas	zyeri: What is the difference?
2018-11-16 13:01:35	brendantcc_lounge	btw IT'S A WHOLE NEEEEWWWW DAAAYYYY over here lol
2018-11-16 13:01:39	tunas	brendantcc_lounge: I put some of my mod files on ~team.
2018-11-16 13:01:46	tunas	brendantcc_lounge: Midnight?
2018-11-16 13:01:51	tunas	You're 14 hours behind me?
2018-11-16 13:01:57	brendantcc_lounge	australia, mate
2018-11-16 13:02:01	zyeri	tunas: C++ usually involves the STL, for example, while "C++" is "C with classes".
2018-11-16 13:02:05	tunas	Oh, *ahead!*
2018-11-16 13:02:06	brendantcc_lounge	time.is/melbourne
2018-11-16 13:02:07	tunas	Makes more sensen.
2018-11-16 13:02:20	brendantcc_lounge	also i think im 14 hours AHEAD
2018-11-16 13:02:26	SinaCutie	xD
2018-11-16 13:02:29	zyeri	note that "C++ but raw pointers", while technically C++, is basically an extension of "C with classes"
2018-11-16 13:02:35	brendantcc_lounge	17th nov, 2018
2018-11-16 13:02:45	tunas	zyeri: In the four years I've been learning c++ at school, we haven't even touched on classes or structs.
2018-11-16 13:02:46	zyeri	brendantcc_lounge: ISO8601 m8
2018-11-16 13:02:50	zyeri	tunas: oh dear
2018-11-16 13:02:51	tunas	Or even functions, I think!
2018-11-16 13:02:56	brendantcc_lounge	hey SinaCutie, you new around here? i dont recall seeing you before
2018-11-16 13:02:57	tunas	Not even arrays!!!!
2018-11-16 13:03:07	tunas	brendantcc_lounge: SinaCutie has been around intermittently.
2018-11-16 13:03:08	zyeri	Goddamned arrays. Don't use those (in C++)
2018-11-16 13:03:10	SinaCutie	I have been around for a week or two :)
2018-11-16 13:03:15	zyeri	use std::array or std::vector instead
2018-11-16 13:03:24	tunas	Ah, I see.
2018-11-16 13:03:26	SinaCutie	I'm usually more active during my morning.
2018-11-16 13:03:34	zyeri	If you need raw arrays, then: 1) you don't need raw arrays and 2) you don't need raw arrays.
2018-11-16 13:03:38	brendantcc_lounge	belated welcome to the crew, SinaCutie!
2018-11-16 13:03:42	SinaCutie	Thankies~
2018-11-16 13:03:49	tunas	Why do they not teach us Python, Clojure, JavaScript, Go, Rust?
2018-11-16 13:03:56	brendantcc_lounge	I'm Brendan *sticks hand out for handshake*
2018-11-16 13:04:14	tunas	Simpler languages with an easier zero-to-functional-practical-program rate?
2018-11-16 13:04:15	zyeri	Well, Python is a decent learning language, but Clojure, JavaScript, Go, and Rust are slightly more complicated to pick up
2018-11-16 13:04:22	brendantcc_lounge	btw you guys are on my tv screen...
2018-11-16 13:04:27	tunas	zyeri: Python is the best choice.
2018-11-16 13:04:29	brendantcc_lounge	got my laptop hooked up over hdmi
2018-11-16 13:04:34	SinaCutie	I'm, uh, Sina. XD
2018-11-16 13:04:35	zyeri	tunas: there is no "best" choice
2018-11-16 13:04:35	tunas	brendantcc_lounge: Neat!
2018-11-16 13:04:40	zyeri	there are only tradeoffs
2018-11-16 13:04:42	SinaCutie	They are all good for different things :) 
2018-11-16 13:04:48	brendantcc_lounge	btw my little bro is watching this convo
2018-11-16 13:04:49	SinaCutie	Like flavours of candy.
2018-11-16 13:04:54	zyeri	if you start with C, you'll learn how memory works fairly quickly
2018-11-16 13:05:10	tunas	For the skill level of the students in my country, and how interested they are in programming?
2018-11-16 13:05:11	brendantcc_lounge	i personally prefer HTML as a start...
2018-11-16 13:05:13	tunas	Python.
2018-11-16 13:05:17	brendantcc_lounge	html
2018-11-16 13:05:22	tunas	Heck, they even found scratch boring.
2018-11-16 13:05:23	zyeri	if you start with Python, it will take longer before you need to start caring about the underlying memory model, but you're more likely to pick up other programming concepts more easily
2018-11-16 13:05:37	tunas	zyeri: Yeah, that's what they need.
2018-11-16 13:05:41	zyeri	tunas: what country? if you don't mind me asking
2018-11-16 13:05:42	brendantcc_lounge	zyeri: is html a good starter language?
2018-11-16 13:05:45	tunas	Macedonia.
2018-11-16 13:05:50	SinaCutie	Oh wow, brendantcc_lounge, it'd been forever since I'd seen <marquee> until checking out your tilde
2018-11-16 13:05:53	tunas	I gotta go to school, see ya later!
2018-11-16 13:05:57	SinaCutie	See you!
2018-11-16 13:06:00	brendantcc_lounge	see ya tunas!
2018-11-16 13:06:04	zyeri	ah, I don't know much about Macedonia
2018-11-16 13:06:12	brendantcc_lounge	and remember to stay in school kids!
2018-11-16 13:06:29	brendantcc_lounge	(this means you, little bro who is watching this conversation)
2018-11-16 13:06:31	zyeri	brendantcc_lounge: aren't you the kid here? :P

2018-11-16 13:07:11	brendantcc_lounge	do nut call me kid
2018-11-16 13:07:13	tunas	I'm seventeen now.
2018-11-16 13:07:24	tunas	Am I still a teen, or is that bordering on young adult?
2018-11-16 13:07:29	brendantcc_lounge	you're still a teen by australian law
2018-11-16 13:07:44	brendantcc_lounge	you ID as adult at 18
2018-11-16 13:07:54	brendantcc_lounge	at least by aussie law...
2018-11-16 13:07:56	SinaCutie	Sarcastically, I'd say "you're a teen until you're twenty."
2018-11-16 13:07:58	brendantcc_lounge	and i think US law...
2018-11-16 13:08:05	brendantcc_lounge	lol sina...
2018-11-16 13:08:30	zyeri	tunas: seventeen? definitely a kid
2018-11-16 13:08:44	zyeri	but I'm 24, so I'm basically ancient in comparison
2018-11-16 13:08:51	brendantcc_lounge	(btw my lil bro is saying "LOL! it's true. it's true!", sinacutie)
2018-11-16 13:08:57	SinaCutie	If you're ancient, what the heck am I, zyeri X'D
2018-11-16 13:09:08	brendantcc_lounge	zyeri: you're older than ben, but younger than tomasino and deepend
2018-11-16 13:09:22	 *	zyeri doesn't know how old everyone else is
2018-11-16 13:09:22	tunas	Funny thing is, I'm a legal adult thanks to a loophole where there is nobody to take custody of me.
2018-11-16 13:09:28	zyeri	oh fun
2018-11-16 13:09:45	brendantcc_lounge	zyeri: im 14 m8
2018-11-16 13:09:50	tunas	So I've been a young adult since the age of 15/16, but not a "young adult".
2018-11-16 13:09:59	brendantcc_lounge	alright gtg
2018-11-16 13:10:05	 *	brendantcc_lounge and lil bro sleps

2018-11-16 13:10:35	tunas	SinaCutie: If you're ancient, how old are you?
2018-11-16 13:10:40	SinaCutie	:') Nearly 31.

2018-11-16 13:11:44	brendantcc_lounge	tell us the days!
2018-11-16 13:12:33	brendantcc_lounge	no really
2018-11-16 13:12:46	SinaCutie	There isn't much to tell. I was in primary school, haha.

2018-11-16 13:28:09	jan6	hey, why not make a tilde bbs?
2018-11-16 13:28:38	jan6	now-a-days there aren't dialup BBSs, but there definitely are quite a few telnet ones
2018-11-16 13:30:42	SinaCutie	I used to telnet into a bbs to play some LORD, but it was incredibly inactive, and thus not so fun. xD
2018-11-16 13:40:04	SinaCutie	Oh yeah, I was gonna turn my tilde theme into a proper colourscheme for the team css. 
2018-11-16 13:51:45	jan6	there are quite a few bbss, some are not terribly inactive
2018-11-16 13:52:03	SinaCutie	Yeah.
2018-11-16 13:52:44	jan6	also, if you go to electronic chicken bbs then there's a lot of real fun ansi blocky games, kinda like really low res graphical games
2018-11-16 13:53:10	jan6	pacman and chicken delivery and lemmings and stuff
2018-11-16 13:57:33	SinaCutie	Hee

2018-11-16 14:06:57	tunas	jan6: I've been to echicken!!
2018-11-16 14:07:25	tunas	Chicken Delivery is still in my memory from when I was a wee lad interested in technology far older than I am. :P
2018-11-16 14:07:31	tunas	(plus I was on a craputer)
2018-11-16 14:27:31	jan6	!whois chicken.cool
2018-11-16 14:27:32	BabiliBot	chicken.cool is 'available'
2018-11-16 14:27:48	jan6	cool domain
2018-11-16 15:13:38	~ben	morning 
2018-11-16 15:27:24	SinaCutie	Hello :) 
2018-11-16 15:30:37	SinaCutie	I'm still tweaking the colours, but this is what I have so far for the dracula colourscheme ben https://sinacutie.ttm.sh/dracula-1.png
2018-11-16 15:31:01	~ben	oh shit that looks amazing
2018-11-16 15:31:09	~ben	far more cohesive than the current colorscheme
2018-11-16 15:32:16	SinaCutie	I have my sources currently at https://tildegit.org/SinaCutie/css/src/branch/feature/dracula-colours
2018-11-16 15:34:33	SinaCutie	There's a few more things that could be changed, but is basically done. :)
2018-11-16 16:00:57	~ben	i'd love to provide that as an additional theme!
2018-11-16 16:05:53	SinaCutie	:) that's why I'm setting up the LESS build system to build it as well as the hacker theme :)
2018-11-16 16:05:59	SinaCutie	Whoops, double smiley
2018-11-16 16:08:36	~ben	oooo nice!
2018-11-16 16:08:58	~ben	i'm pretty awful at colors/design stuff, so i love getting patches for it :D
2018-11-16 16:09:12	SinaCutie	You should be able to npm run build and it will build it out into the dist/ folder.
2018-11-16 16:09:24	SinaCutie	Hee. I am usually pretty bad with them myself.
2018-11-16 16:09:49	~ben	lol your screenshot is evidence to the contrary at least!
2018-11-16 16:20:24	~ben	just got the PR! looks great!
2018-11-16 16:20:44	~ben	looks like you committed a .kate-swp file from your editor SinaCutie 
2018-11-16 16:20:53	SinaCutie	Oh whoops
2018-11-16 16:20:56	SinaCutie	I will fix that.
2018-11-16 16:21:22	SinaCutie	I thought I'd disabled that file generation. >_<
2018-11-16 16:21:35	~ben	feel free to add it to .gitignore if you like!
2018-11-16 16:22:27	~ben	you could also change the npm run deploy script to scp dist/*.css tilde.team:/var/www/tilde.team/css/
2018-11-16 16:22:40	~ben	or i can do that after merging it
2018-11-16 16:22:56	SinaCutie	Oh right, I will do that while I remove this file.
2018-11-16 16:23:18	~ben	oh ok perfect :)
2018-11-16 16:27:20	SinaCutie	There we go. :)
2018-11-16 16:28:10	~ben	gotta be scp dist/*.css tilde.team:/var/www/tilde.team/css/
2018-11-16 16:28:25	SinaCutie	Ah, I thought you mistyped in here. XD
2018-11-16 16:28:25	~ben	drop the hacker.css on the end or it'll skip darcula.css
2018-11-16 16:28:30	SinaCutie	So you want me to remove you from it.
2018-11-16 16:28:36	SinaCutie	I was leaving it as it was.
2018-11-16 16:28:49	~ben	oh yeah, it will take your current $USER
2018-11-16 16:29:01	~ben	and if you don't have access to /var/www/tilde.team you won't be able to do it anyways
2018-11-16 16:29:05	SinaCutie	Yeah.
2018-11-16 16:32:58	SinaCutie	It was just there when I forked so I assumed it had to be that way for some reason. xD
2018-11-16 16:33:07	~ben	oh you're still overwriting hacker.css specifially
2018-11-16 16:33:20	SinaCutie	Hm?
2018-11-16 16:33:30	~ben	so dist/*.css will pick up dracula.css and hacker.css 
2018-11-16 16:33:34	SinaCutie	Yes
2018-11-16 16:33:40	~ben	and be copied to /var/www/tilde.team/css/hacker.css twice
2018-11-16 16:34:21	SinaCutie	Hm?
2018-11-16 16:34:22	SinaCutie	Oh no
2018-11-16 16:34:24	SinaCutie	The scp line lmao
2018-11-16 16:34:35	SinaCutie	weh
2018-11-16 16:34:52	SinaCutie	I should have waited until I was more awake :')
2018-11-16 16:36:12	SinaCutie	"deploy": "scp dist/*.css tilde.team:/var/www/tilde.team/css/",
2018-11-16 16:36:15	SinaCutie	Would be proper, yeah?
2018-11-16 16:37:10	~ben	yup exactly :)
2018-11-16 16:37:19	~ben	thanks for bearing with me on that
2018-11-16 16:37:37	SinaCutie	Thanks for putting up with my micro-commits :V
2018-11-16 16:37:43	SinaCutie	I'm usually not so scattered xD
2018-11-16 16:37:56	SinaCutie	I am on new meds. 
2018-11-16 16:39:09	~ben	lol no problem!
2018-11-16 16:49:26	~ben	SinaCutie: should be deployed!
2018-11-16 16:50:09	SinaCutie	Okay!
2018-11-16 16:50:27	SinaCutie	Converting my page to using it :)
2018-11-16 16:51:04	~ben	woot!
2018-11-16 16:51:15	~ben	i just switched my page to it
2018-11-16 16:51:18	~ben	looks super good
2018-11-16 16:51:20	~ben	:D
2018-11-16 16:51:41	SinaCutie	:D
2018-11-16 16:52:11	SinaCutie	Oh it does look good on yours.
2018-11-16 16:53:23	SinaCutie	Also did bb rebuild on my blog and it looks good too
2018-11-16 16:58:10	~ben	oh i should probably do that too!
2018-11-16 16:58:25	~ben	i was going to edit my blog post from yesterday too
2018-11-16 17:17:39	jan6	-rwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data 116K Nov 16 18:48 hacker.css
2018-11-16 17:17:48	jan6	lol, why's hacker.css executable?
2018-11-16 17:24:11	aewens	Because it's secretly a malicious malware binary tricking you into thinking it's just a cascading style sheet, of course /s
2018-11-16 17:25:14	~ben	fixed
2018-11-16 17:25:16	~ben	thanks
2018-11-16 17:25:26	aewens	However I'm guessing it's more becauce someone did `chmod -R 755` instead of `chmod -R 744`.
2018-11-16 17:26:24	~ben	i'm not sure
2018-11-16 17:35:42	jan6	not sure the index.php needs to be executable either, since it doesn't have any hasbangs at the start, but that's fine, helps differentiate
2018-11-16 17:43:07	~ben	php needs to be executable

2018-11-16 21:45:33	giacomo	ben: I do not know nginx much, but there is a way I can put a folder behind authetnication in my public_html?
2018-11-16 21:46:00	giacomo	in apache I would use an htaccess, but apparently nginx doesn't support it
2018-11-16 21:46:13	~ben	yeah htaccess is an apache thing
2018-11-16 21:46:49	giacomo	I can write a php script but maybe there is something simpler/faster
2018-11-16 21:47:00	~ben	there's no easy way to do that because i have so many server blocks set up for user sites
2018-11-16 21:47:26	~ben	if i were to add it, i'd have to add that rule for every vhost
2018-11-16 21:59:07	jan6	given you can't put folder behind auth, you can't really protect the files in it, even with php
2018-11-16 21:59:15	jan6	as long as the person knows the url
2018-11-16 21:59:56	~ben	why's that?
2018-11-16 22:00:07	~ben	put the file outside public_html
2018-11-16 22:00:16	~ben	pass the filename/path as a parameter to php
2018-11-16 22:18:01	giacomo	fine looks reasonable... I thought there was a way I was missing... I'll go with the php approach
2018-11-16 22:18:22	jan6	hmm, that way maybe
2018-11-16 22:19:42	giacomo	I guess you could limit php to do that for security reasons too...
2018-11-16 22:20:08	giacomo	I mean, to open file outside the virtual host
2018-11-16 22:21:25	~ben	yeah, basically anything in public_html is public
2018-11-16 22:24:50	jan6	I 17:19:42           giacomo | I guess you could limit php to do that for security reasons too...
2018-11-16 22:24:54	jan6	do what?
2018-11-16 22:37:42	giacomo	jan6: open files outside the virtual host
2018-11-16 22:38:21	giacomo	it has been a while since I professionally programmed in PHP but I remember it was possible (on apache) a decade ago
2018-11-16 22:47:11	jan6	you mean by that?
2018-11-16 22:47:48	giacomo	not sure I understand your question jan6 
2018-11-16 22:48:16	jan6	"limit php to do that"

2018-11-16 23:04:10	~ben	yo waddup cognifice 
2018-11-16 23:04:13	~ben	how goes it
2018-11-16 23:05:13	cognifice	Okay, a bit bored. What is something fun to do?
2018-11-16 23:05:39	~ben	hmm
2018-11-16 23:05:47	~ben	i mean i usually just hang out on irc
2018-11-16 23:05:54	jan6	make an irc bot
2018-11-16 23:05:55	aewens	I find offering unhelpful advice can be fun sometimes.
2018-11-16 23:06:03	~ben	read some stories on https://tilde.news
2018-11-16 23:06:09	jan6	then make an OS in php
2018-11-16 23:06:32	aewens	jan6: They said fun, not masochistic pleasure
2018-11-16 23:06:38	jan6	heh
2018-11-16 23:06:41	jan6	to each their own
2018-11-16 23:08:50	cognifice	I have no idea how to do any of those things.
2018-11-16 23:10:18	aewens	cognifice: You have the whole of human knowledge wrapped up in the Internet to learn how to.
2018-11-16 23:11:37	~ben	checking up on https://tilde.news doesn't require any special knowledge
2018-11-16 23:11:40	cognifice	1.Just because it is available, doesn't mean it can be used.
2018-11-16 23:12:02	cognifice	2. There is no reasonable incentive to do so.
2018-11-16 23:12:10	~ben	huh?
2018-11-16 23:13:41	aewens	Okay, then what incentives are compelling you to do things now?
2018-11-16 23:15:22	cognifice	Honestly, not sure. Anhedonia can be a b****.
2018-11-16 23:17:23	aewens	Does avoiding displeasure work, because that can also be a motivating factor.
2018-11-16 23:20:06	cognifice	Maybe.
2018-11-16 23:21:49	edwardthefma	Sup all
2018-11-16 23:21:49	cognifice	I played around on YourWorldOfText.com for a bit, but it soon lost its appeal.
2018-11-16 23:22:01	cognifice	Hi, @edwardthefma.
2018-11-16 23:22:22	aewens	cognifice: Try out the paperclip game http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html
2018-11-16 23:24:09	cognifice	Ewww, it is one of those cookie clicker type games. No thanks.
2018-11-16 23:24:56	giacomo	ben: with accesskey="S" on an input type=submit you can get Alt+Shift+S to sumbit the form without javascript 
2018-11-16 23:25:35	giacomo	I'll add to the sr.ht todo as an info... even if it's not exactly what was asked...
2018-11-16 23:25:40	~ben	would that work from inside a textarea?
2018-11-16 23:25:46	giacomo	but it's the best approximation I can get
2018-11-16 23:25:50	giacomo	I think so
2018-11-16 23:25:53	~ben	did you snag an account over there?
2018-11-16 23:26:03	~ben	ohh i see what you're saying
2018-11-16 23:26:10	~ben	add that attribute to the input
2018-11-16 23:26:24	giacomo	yes it work
2018-11-16 23:26:34	~ben	it's a super cool project
2018-11-16 23:26:41	giacomo	to the submit
2018-11-16 23:26:42	~ben	i've been hanging out in #sr.ht on freenode too
2018-11-16 23:27:00	~ben	i'm just used to using ctrl+enter 
2018-11-16 23:27:42	giacomo	yes very cool I've just written to Drew: I'd like to use it with Jehanne
2018-11-16 23:28:02	~ben	he seemed open to getting projects on there
2018-11-16 23:28:13	giacomo	but building an OS (if a small one) is an expensive task
2018-11-16 23:28:25	~ben	oh dang i had your blog post up on my other machine
2018-11-16 23:28:30	~ben	haven't had a chance to look at it yet
2018-11-16 23:28:43	~ben	oh btw a nitpick: it's awakens not awakes
2018-11-16 23:28:46	giacomo	if the build run more smoothly than on travis I would pay my $20
2018-11-16 23:29:03	~ben	i think the execution limit is 1 hour right now
2018-11-16 23:29:20	giacomo	it could suffice

2018-11-16 23:30:12	giacomo	building the whole Jehanne is 2 to 3 minutes, tests (run in qemu) take 10 minutes (and are run two times)
2018-11-16 23:30:20	~ben	he also mentioned that project organizations will be coming soon-ish 
2018-11-16 23:30:24	giacomo	the problem is building the gcc cross toolchain
2018-11-16 23:30:27	~ben	with a ^prefix instead of ~user
2018-11-16 23:30:42	~ben	that definitely sounds doable
2018-11-16 23:32:06	giacomo	the ~ prefix in newsletters sound a bit strange though :-)
2018-11-16 23:35:48	~ben	lol yeah it does doesn't it
2018-11-16 23:38:17	giacomo	ben: does "awakes" mean anything? is a word in English?
2018-11-16 23:38:50	giacomo	I don't like the title of that post, but it was too late to think a better one... 
2018-11-16 23:39:28	~ben	not a proper word
2018-11-16 23:39:30	giacomo	and google translate was able to translate it in Italian
2018-11-16 23:39:40	~ben	the verb is awaken
2018-11-16 23:39:46	~ben	awake is an adjective
2018-11-16 23:41:49	giacomo	fuck... http://www.wordreference.com/enit/awake fooled me
2018-11-16 23:44:53	~ben	huh yeah that's wrong

2018-11-16 23:49:24	giacomo	so the system call is badly named awake(milliseconds), right?

2018-11-17 00:09:49	tomasino	nice! tilde auto-switch streams, or do i need to be careful to cut out my show right at 0200 UTC?
2018-11-17 00:09:56	tomasino	anonradio cuts me off, so that's why i'm not sure
2018-11-17 00:11:38	deepend	is all good tomasino .. I will just go on whenever your off.. tilderadio times are always somewhat flexible :)

2018-11-17 00:47:58	giacomo	I've had an exchange with Drew over mails: he proposed to even set up a base image to build on Jehanne natively, but this cannot work as Jehanne is not self-hosted yet and I have no sshd

2018-11-17 20:06:40	tomasino	hiya
2018-11-17 20:06:50	~ben	yo tomasino 
2018-11-17 20:06:52	~ben	how goes it
2018-11-17 20:06:59	tomasino	good good
2018-11-17 20:07:09	tomasino	i got myself distracted and dusted off an old makefile experiment 
2018-11-17 20:07:15	~ben	noice
2018-11-17 20:07:18	tomasino	https://github.com/jamestomasino/ts-boilerplate
2018-11-17 20:07:27	tomasino	i went into a little typescript hole
2018-11-17 20:07:47	~ben	oh solid
2018-11-17 20:07:54	tomasino	it's a little weird on that front still. I need to figure out a better way to deal with modules that doesn't require a loader and a bunch of crap later
2018-11-17 20:08:18	tomasino	it started as an experiment to see if I could make a super-modern web dev workflow without webpack
2018-11-17 20:08:27	tomasino	it's close. very, very close
2018-11-17 20:08:33	tomasino	and that makefile is dead sexy
2018-11-17 20:08:34	~ben	webpack is huge
2018-11-17 20:08:41	tomasino	webpack is awful in every single way
2018-11-17 20:09:06	tomasino	it's bundled into too many things
2018-11-17 20:09:07	~ben	any ideas on how to pull in the plex webfonts for team/css
2018-11-17 20:09:11	~ben	https://tildegit.org/team/css
2018-11-17 20:09:22	~ben	you made me think of it again now that you're talking about web stuffs
2018-11-17 20:09:33	tomasino	oh, yeah. they're google webfontsn
2018-11-17 20:09:34	~ben	there's also a super nice alternate color theme 
2018-11-17 20:09:41	tomasino	you just select the weights you need and download the ttfs
2018-11-17 20:09:43	~ben	thanks to SinaCutie for that patch
2018-11-17 20:09:48	tomasino	then rurn it through fontsquirrel
2018-11-17 20:09:55	~ben	i thought webfonts were woff2
2018-11-17 20:10:01	~ben	they include those in the releases
2018-11-17 20:10:10	tomasino	then that saved you the fontsquirrel trouble
2018-11-17 20:10:21	tomasino	woff && woff2 for slightly older browser support
2018-11-17 20:10:35	~ben	i just don't know how to get them to work with the less build thingy
2018-11-17 20:10:38	tomasino	thanks SinaCutie 
2018-11-17 20:10:43	~ben	so the paths are right

2018-11-17 20:11:37	tomasino	like this
2018-11-17 20:12:38	jan6	15:09:55              ~ben | i thought webfonts were woff2
2018-11-17 20:12:46	fosslinux	not alway
2018-11-17 20:12:47	jan6	webfonts are anything the browser supports
2018-11-17 20:13:18	jan6	generally woff,woff2,ttf,otf I think a few less common ones technically too
2018-11-17 20:14:21	fosslinux	ie supports more

2018-11-17 22:59:46	login1	let me change one thing
2018-11-17 23:00:11	login1	Alright, I changed the one thing. Does it still continue to work ben?
2018-11-17 23:00:19	~ben	no
2018-11-17 23:00:26	login1	So the thing I changed was the permission on "other"
2018-11-17 23:00:52	login1	Are you able to directly run /home/login/bin/holodeck?
2018-11-17 23:00:57	login1	(on your own shell, outside tilde)
2018-11-17 23:01:10	login1	(outside the tilde executable)
2018-11-17 23:01:37	~ben	not executable by this user
2018-11-17 23:01:47	login1	are you part of the 'team' group?
2018-11-17 23:01:49	~ben	-rwsr-x---
2018-11-17 23:01:51	~ben	no
2018-11-17 23:01:53	~ben	i'm not
2018-11-17 23:01:59	login1	So who is part of the team group?
2018-11-17 23:02:03	-->	benharri (benharri@tilde.team) has joined #team
2018-11-17 23:02:21	login1	Well, now i'm utterly confused...
2018-11-17 23:02:25	login1	ben=benharri, right?
2018-11-17 23:02:33	<--	benharri (benharri@tilde.team) has quit (quit: WeeChat 2.3)
2018-11-17 23:02:49	~ben	sry, i switched to the benharri user that is in team gropu
2018-11-17 23:03:06	login1	no need to apologise. you are 100% within your rights to do so
2018-11-17 23:03:16	login1	did it work with benharri?
2018-11-17 23:03:18	~ben	yes
2018-11-17 23:03:38	login1	My aim was to have it work with anyone in the team group, but not have it work with others (just to be cautious)
2018-11-17 23:03:57	login1	Is that okay for the purposes of the tilde executable?
2018-11-17 23:04:10	~ben	??
2018-11-17 23:04:14	login1	btw, if it's not rude, why is ben not a part of tilde but benharri is?
2018-11-17 23:04:24	~ben	why bother having different permissions for group and other
2018-11-17 23:04:30	login1	(by 'tilde', i meant 'team')
2018-11-17 23:04:40	~ben	oh, my user is in sudo
2018-11-17 23:04:58	login1	Well, 'nobody' should not be able to execute holodeck
2018-11-17 23:05:38	~ben	who's that?
2018-11-17 23:06:01	~ben	ok i added the sudoers to the team group 
2018-11-17 23:06:05	~ben	as a secondary grou;p
2018-11-17 23:06:27	~ben	i wouldn't consider that a security risk
2018-11-17 23:06:44	login1	https://askubuntu.com/questions/329714/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-nobody-user
2018-11-17 23:07:01	login1	i don't know what a secondary group is
2018-11-17 23:07:17	~ben	look at id
2018-11-17 23:07:19	~ben	`id`
2018-11-17 23:07:24	~ben	and `id ben`
2018-11-17 23:07:32	~ben	gid= is your primary group
2018-11-17 23:07:40	~ben	groups= is your secondary groups
2018-11-17 23:08:35	login1	I think every user that is a part of tilde.team should be a part of the team group
2018-11-17 23:08:43	~ben	that's the idea, yes
2018-11-17 23:08:48	login1	If someone hacks this server's httpd (which runs as 'nobody'), they should not be able to run holodec
2018-11-17 23:09:01	~ben	nginx runs as www-data
2018-11-17 23:09:21	login1	www-data is a user?
2018-11-17 23:09:26	~ben	yes
2018-11-17 23:09:34	~ben	less /etc/passwd
2018-11-17 23:12:13	login1	Alright, so i checked which groups www-data is a part of, and it's not a part of team
2018-11-17 23:12:39	~ben	yeah it's not
2018-11-17 23:12:43	login1	so if nginx were compromised and arbitrary command execution became possible, tilde.team's website might get defaced, but holodeck will remain untouched without a privilege escalation vulnerability
2018-11-17 23:13:00	~ben	lol what
2018-11-17 23:13:24	login1	basically, www-data should not run holodeck
2018-11-17 23:13:24	~ben	that would be the least of my worries
2018-11-17 23:13:30	~ben	but ok
2018-11-17 23:13:37	login1	I mean, what can www-data do?
2018-11-17 23:13:42	login1	What does it have access to?
2018-11-17 23:13:54	@khuxkm|lounge	I'm having issues ssh'ing into tilde.team
2018-11-17 23:14:14	~ben	ok i heard back from hetzner
2018-11-17 23:14:19	login1	Not much right, if 0 permissions are set on 'other'
2018-11-17 23:14:21	~ben	they're saying it's still up
2018-11-17 23:14:29	login1	We're not on hetzner rn?
2018-11-17 23:14:30	~ben	and something's misconfigured on my end?
2018-11-17 23:14:34	~ben	lolwut
2018-11-17 23:14:40	~ben	~team is on hetzner
2018-11-17 23:14:44	login1	alright
2018-11-17 23:15:04	@khuxkm|lounge	so SSH is reporting alive AFAICT (using tildecheck)
2018-11-17 23:15:05	login1	i was able to connect to tilde.team again...
2018-11-17 23:15:21	~ben	ssh is working fine for me
2018-11-17 23:15:36	@khuxkm|lounge	i waited 22 seconds and it doesn't load
2018-11-17 23:15:38	~ben	secondary ip is still unroutable for some reason
2018-11-17 23:15:39	login1	oh wait, i don't ssh into tilde.team, i mosh
2018-11-17 23:15:45	~ben	same thing login1 
2018-11-17 23:15:56	login1	well, yeah
2018-11-17 23:16:03	@khuxkm|lounge	hmm
2018-11-17 23:16:06	login1	but i ran ssh ttm, and that worked too
2018-11-17 23:16:17	@khuxkm|lounge	i mean, my ping is just fine
2018-11-17 23:16:23	~ben	ttm.sh resolves to the primary ip
2018-11-17 23:16:25	@khuxkm|lounge	but SSH is taking forever and I don't know why
2018-11-17 23:16:43	~ben	ssh.tilde.team is the only record that resolves to the secondary ip
2018-11-17 23:16:46	login1	perhaps the load is high and crypto takes time?
2018-11-17 23:16:54	@khuxkm|lounge	!load
2018-11-17 23:17:06	@khuxkm|lounge	can someone see if we're under load stress?
2018-11-17 23:17:52	login1	perhaps it's because of port?
2018-11-17 23:18:03	~ben	.uptime
2018-11-17 23:18:03	zaphod	 18:18:03 up 130 days, 21:05, 186 users,  load average: 0.70, 1.22, 1.33

2018-11-17 23:18:32	login1	zaphod is a good bot
2018-11-17 23:18:38	~ben	ok ssh.tilde.team is back up
2018-11-17 23:18:55	login1	i think ssh.tilde.team's ports are closed...
2018-11-17 23:19:01	~ben	nope it's up
2018-11-17 23:19:08	~ben	i just tested it
2018-11-17 23:19:15	login1	alright, now 22 worked
2018-11-17 23:19:38	login1	i tried 80 when 22 didn't work, then 80 didn't work, then i wrote ports are closed, before which you wrote ssh.tilde.team is back up
2018-11-17 23:19:55	login1	I confirmed connected through ssh.tilde.team
2018-11-17 23:20:14	@khuxkm	there we go
2018-11-17 23:20:22	login1	I think we should inaugurate holodeck's first room
2018-11-17 23:20:32	login1	Everything else starts from this room.
2018-11-17 23:20:46	login1	It's like creating a genesis block for an infinite story tree/cycle
2018-11-17 23:22:35	~ben	i've never used it before
2018-11-18 00:18:29	--	giacomo is now known as giacomo_
2018-11-18 00:56:27	fosslinux	asm/amcclure: and... how were you getting that to work

2018-11-18 01:01:50	tunas	Maybe it was a pun?
2018-11-18 01:01:54	tunas	Torch torture?
2018-11-18 01:01:58	~ben	oh that could be
2018-11-18 01:03:19	edwardthefma	I have a villager incased in a glass case under water
2018-11-18 01:03:41	fosslinux	why why why
2018-11-18 01:03:46	fosslinux	why would you do that
2018-11-18 01:03:50	edwardthefma	So he can be bait for drowned zombis
2018-11-18 01:04:04	fosslinux	oh ok
2018-11-18 01:04:07	fosslinux	that makes sense
2018-11-18 01:04:22	fosslinux	drowned

2018-11-18 01:04:49	@khuxkm|lounge	^
2018-11-18 01:05:16	fosslinux	lol i didn't know there was a 1.13.2
2018-11-18 01:05:21	fosslinux	i only knew there was 1.13
2018-11-18 01:08:17	fosslinux	ben: i was going to run linkchecker (https://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/) on tilde.team from ~team, just don't want to do it without checking with you in case thats not allowed by hetzner or you
2018-11-18 01:08:51	~ben	that should be ok
2018-11-18 01:08:56	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-18 01:08:58	fosslinux	cool
2018-11-18 01:09:02	~ben	feel free to run it against localhost
2018-11-18 01:09:06	fosslinux	yep
2018-11-18 01:09:08	fosslinux	that was my plan
2018-11-18 01:09:16	~ben	like curl -H "Host:https://tilde.team" localhost
2018-11-18 01:09:19	fosslinux	but hetzner got pissed by nmapping against lcoalhost
2018-11-18 01:09:25	~ben	i've blocked those subnets
2018-11-18 01:09:35	fosslinux	very good idea
2018-11-18 01:09:36	~ben	10/8 isn't necessarily localhost
2018-11-18 01:11:41	fosslinux	"This program requires Python requests 2.2.0 or later." um that's installed
2018-11-18 01:11:43	fosslinux	anyone know why?
2018-11-18 01:12:09	fosslinux	oh nvm it's in /usr/local thats why
2018-11-18 01:12:21	~ben	the python3-requests package is installed
2018-11-18 01:12:35	~ben	so is python-requests
2018-11-18 01:12:38	fosslinux	as is python2
2018-11-18 01:12:48	fosslinux	weird

2018-11-18 01:16:01	~ben	what are you looking for?
2018-11-18 01:16:29	fosslinux	well it installed requests
2018-11-18 01:16:42	fosslinux	i found there was a newer version
2018-11-18 01:16:56	fosslinux	so i downloaded the wheel and ran pip install --user blah.whl
2018-11-18 01:17:03	fosslinux	and it installed requests too
2018-11-18 01:17:07	fosslinux	but its already installed

2018-11-18 02:23:43	tomasino	there it is... BetaMaster - Alcohol120 Activator
2018-11-18 02:23:49	tomasino	it was a keygen track on that
2018-11-18 02:24:11	tomasino	great stuff
2018-11-18 02:34:16	~ben	awesome little site :D
2018-11-18 03:03:30	amcclure	back
2018-11-18 03:03:56	~ben	front
2018-11-18 03:03:57	amcclure	fosslinux: php include code
2018-11-18 03:04:10	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-18 03:04:31	fosslinux	i would just ask ben to forward it to amcclure.tilde.team
2018-11-18 03:04:34	fosslinux	thats easier
2018-11-18 03:04:40	~ben	hm?
2018-11-18 03:04:59	amcclure	it's okay
2018-11-18 03:05:13	amcclure	I want asm.* to still be for ~team
2018-11-18 03:05:20	fosslinux	and amcclure for?
2018-11-18 03:05:35	~ben	there are far too many default pages left
2018-11-18 03:05:37	~ben	imo
2018-11-18 03:05:49	amcclure	since amcclure.ttm.sh (and just amcclure.ttm.sh) has an A Name record to hexhaxtron's server (thunix.org)
2018-11-18 03:06:12	fosslinux	ben: i think i asked you before but i fogot
2018-11-18 03:06:18	~ben	asked me what
2018-11-18 03:06:24	fosslinux	how do you get the list of people on the home page
2018-11-18 03:06:27	fosslinux	their websites
2018-11-18 03:06:53	~ben	fosslinux: https://tildegit.org/team/site/src/branch/master/index.php#L96-L104
2018-11-18 03:07:14	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-18 03:07:16	fosslinux	i see
2018-11-18 03:07:38	fosslinux	maybe add a if directory is empty/contains only default page then do not list
2018-11-18 03:09:58	~ben	hmm
2018-11-18 03:10:15	~ben	i think the solution there is to just have people update their default page :P
2018-11-18 03:10:25	fosslinux	yeah
2018-11-18 03:13:24	amcclure	changed my site from the default page
2018-11-18 03:15:08	~ben	heh ok good
2018-11-18 03:15:55	fosslinux	but /go 11
2018-11-18 03:15:58	fosslinux	ahhhh
2018-11-18 03:16:19	~ben	only 11 buffers?

2018-11-18 03:17:10	amcclure	consolidate?
2018-11-18 03:17:10	@khuxkm|lounge	then again, most of my channels are run under thelounge :P
2018-11-18 03:17:27	@khuxkm|lounge	I use irssi instead of weechat for my shell IRC
2018-11-18 03:17:37	~ben	yeah, combine them to one

2018-11-19 00:11:04	tomasino	YAY
2018-11-19 00:11:05	~ben	they should probably just be one repo
2018-11-19 00:11:23	~ben	since the css now has a hard dep on the fonts being present in the site 
2018-11-19 00:12:00	~ben	or move the fonts to the css repo and include them with the deploy
2018-11-19 00:12:06	~ben	so many brittle deps in there
2018-11-19 00:14:09	~ben	thoughts tomasino ?
2018-11-19 00:14:25	~ben	i mean it works for now with this exact setup
2018-11-19 00:17:30	tomasino	if they're a fixed static resource you could host it on a different subdomain dedicated to cookie-less static assets. Have that repo pull from an s3-like entity
2018-11-19 00:17:49	tomasino	you'd get some performance optimization off of that and keep your repos pure text
2018-11-19 00:18:01	tomasino	but it's probably overkill for your traffic and content
2018-11-19 00:18:19	~ben	that's definitely overkill
2018-11-19 00:18:22	tomasino	;)
2018-11-19 00:18:31	~ben	this box gets unlimited traffic from hetzner

2018-11-19 00:18:56	tomasino	yeah, just toss them in the repo
2018-11-19 00:19:11	~ben	there's just weird cross-deps between the css and site repos
2018-11-19 00:19:18	~ben	not sure how to solve it without merging them

2018-11-19 23:31:42	~ben	lol idk 
2018-11-19 23:31:49	~ben	still trying to figure out what to do with it
2018-11-19 23:31:59	~ben	in any case i'm still very inexperienced with bsd admin
2018-11-19 23:58:23	tomasino	bsd is so new to me too
2018-11-19 23:58:33	tomasino	i miss all my gnu toys

2018-11-19 23:59:37	~ben	tomasino: i'm working on moving css into the site repo
2018-11-19 23:59:39	~ben	makefile time
2018-11-19 23:59:44	tomasino	huzzah!
2018-11-19 23:59:54	tomasino	you just reminded me to log into bsd.one and hit some man pages
2018-11-20 00:00:04	~ben	how janky is this: https://ttm.sh/iY.bin
2018-11-20 00:02:09	tomasino	does that work?
2018-11-20 00:02:54	tomasino	hmm, i guess it might
2018-11-20 00:03:28	tomasino	what's up with the touch Makefile?
2018-11-20 00:03:45	tomasino	and why are your clean instructions all inlined?
2018-11-20 00:04:09	tomasino	your phony calls for a watch, but you defined a dev
2018-11-20 00:04:53	tomasino	let me see what i can do here
2018-11-20 00:04:57	tomasino	do you prefer using npm over yarn?
2018-11-20 00:07:10	~ben	i'm pushing it up right now
2018-11-20 00:07:12	~ben	one sec
2018-11-20 00:07:29	~ben	old leftover from something i learned from one of my undergrad profs

2018-11-20 00:09:38	tomasino	https://ttm.sh/iC.bin
2018-11-20 00:10:07	~ben	npm is just as fast as yarn nowadays
2018-11-20 00:10:26	tomasino	i changed up your dependency tree a bit
2018-11-20 00:10:30	~ben	oh wow
2018-11-20 00:10:33	~ben	ok hold on
2018-11-20 00:11:00	tomasino	phony needs to match the targets still
2018-11-20 00:11:02	tomasino	i didn't fix that
2018-11-20 00:11:07	tomasino	one sec

2018-11-20 00:11:22	tomasino	there you go
2018-11-20 00:11:42	~ben	this is so much sexier
2018-11-20 00:11:58	tomasino	hang on
2018-11-20 00:12:00	tomasino	simplifying more
2018-11-20 00:12:03	tomasino	;)
2018-11-20 00:12:15	~ben	lmao
2018-11-20 00:13:03	~ben	could probably pull some of those things out of package.json.scripts
2018-11-20 00:13:12	tomasino	https://ttm.sh/i1.txt
2018-11-20 00:13:14	~ben	https://tildegit.org/team/site/src/branch/merge-css/css/package.json#L6
2018-11-20 00:13:44	tomasino	oh yes
2018-11-20 00:13:48	tomasino	we can make those make tasks
2018-11-20 00:13:52	~ben	yusss
2018-11-20 00:14:01	tomasino	you see the pattern from here?
2018-11-20 00:14:02	~ben	i'm rm'ing the build artifacts
2018-11-20 00:14:08	~ben	yee
2018-11-20 00:14:19	~ben	do i not need to rm the build artifacts?
2018-11-20 00:14:48	tomasino	i didn't see where they were coming from before
2018-11-20 00:14:55	tomasino	if you move those commands into the makefile it's more obvious
2018-11-20 00:14:56	~ben	oh yeah it's in package.json
2018-11-20 00:14:59	tomasino	you have named targets now
2018-11-20 00:15:03	~ben	yeah i'll have a look at that
2018-11-20 00:16:55	tomasino	i'm almost done
2018-11-20 00:17:36	~ben	oh shit ok
2018-11-20 00:19:39	tomasino	i'm not 100% sure what your dev server syntax is supposed to be, but have a lookie at this...
2018-11-20 00:19:51	tomasino	https://ttm.sh/i4.txt
2018-11-20 00:20:19	tomasino	what is lessc? is that something installed via node?
2018-11-20 00:20:32	tomasino	or should I test that it's globally installed?
2018-11-20 00:20:36	~ben	lessc is installed with node dev-deps
2018-11-20 00:20:46	~ben	no it should be in node_modules/bin
2018-11-20 00:20:51	~ben	or .bin
2018-11-20 00:20:57	tomasino	so i should path it that way?
2018-11-20 00:21:07	~ben	probably, same with light-server
2018-11-20 00:21:36	tomasino	gotcha, uno-momento
2018-11-20 00:21:39	~ben	thanks!
2018-11-20 00:21:50	tomasino	do you want the option to deploy node_modules to a unique location?
2018-11-20 00:22:00	~ben	nah
2018-11-20 00:22:03	~ben	no need
2018-11-20 00:22:09	~ben	since we're running npm install
2018-11-20 00:22:19	tomasino	okay
2018-11-20 00:23:30	~ben	should we pull the OBJS into less/hacker/*.less and less/dracula/*.less?
2018-11-20 00:24:13	tomasino	https://ttm.sh/iU.txt
2018-11-20 00:24:23	tomasino	that would be cleaner for the dependency watching, sure
2018-11-20 00:25:16	tomasino	then instead of OBJS you could list those patterns explictly for each build thingy
2018-11-20 00:25:17	brendantcc_lounge	internet dad! :D
2018-11-20 00:25:26	tomasino	hi brendantcc_lounge 
2018-11-20 00:25:32	~ben	the # in the lightserver thing is necessary and it tells it what to run when a file changes for live-reloading
2018-11-20 00:26:06	tomasino	gotcha, i'm not sure how that will work in a makefile
2018-11-20 00:26:12	tomasino	since that's a comment starter
2018-11-20 00:26:22	tomasino	it may need to be escaped
2018-11-20 00:26:32	brendantcc_lounge	rip, your index.html is blank on tilde.team, tomasino..
2018-11-20 00:26:41	~ben	oh ok 
2018-11-20 00:26:47	tomasino	brendantcc_lounge: that's intentional
2018-11-20 00:26:55	brendantcc_lounge	whyyy

2018-11-20 00:28:22	~ben	ok
2018-11-20 00:28:27	~ben	thanks for the pointers!
2018-11-20 00:29:05	tomasino	anywhere you can make a file be the dependency or the output, make will work better
2018-11-20 00:29:32	tomasino	avoid phonys as much as you can because they're alwaays "new" and will trigger rebuilds
2018-11-20 00:30:29	~ben	ohhh ok :)
2018-11-20 00:31:11	brendantcc_lounge	and how much will that cost? $50,000 for the bricks?

2018-11-20 01:17:28	ahriman	im so happy tilde.pizza is registered even if it's aliased to team

2018-11-20 01:23:38	tomasino	who has tilde.black?
2018-11-20 01:23:51	~ben	not me
2018-11-20 01:24:34	tomasino	i'll probably run some sort of tilde one day
2018-11-20 01:24:40	tomasino	but it may be a gopher outpost
2018-11-20 01:25:30	ahriman	id like to run a tilde on openbsd and let people have their homepage served over httpd(8)
2018-11-20 01:25:43	ahriman	with support for compiled cgi
2018-11-20 01:26:32	ahriman	and sqlite, so they could experiment with BCHS
2018-11-20 01:26:42	tomasino	i think that's all a great idea
2018-11-20 01:27:04	~ben	oooh that would be dope
2018-11-20 01:27:15	~ben	i wouldn't mind setting that up on bsd.tilde.team
2018-11-20 01:27:19	tomasino	i'm thinking about an RPG style tilde outpost
2018-11-20 01:27:26	tomasino	in-game stuff
2018-11-20 01:27:42	~ben	if you'd like to, that would excellent
2018-11-20 01:28:03	~ben	cause there isn't anything specific going on over there
2018-11-20 01:28:07	ahriman	ben openbsd httpd(8) is pretty simple to set up, check out https://learnbchs.org
2018-11-20 01:28:08	tomasino	gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180705-space-gopher-2000
2018-11-20 01:28:23	~ben	is it not on freebsd?
2018-11-20 01:28:36	ahriman	nah it's only openbsd
2018-11-20 01:28:47	tomasino	i think it's poorly ported, but yeah, you don't want to use httpd off openbsd
2018-11-20 01:29:05	ahriman	its the native web server and it also uses slowcgi(8) which is the native openbsd fastcgi interface
2018-11-20 01:29:49	~ben	why would i want the cgi to be slow?
2018-11-20 01:30:55	ahriman	it's not slow it's a play on fastcgi
2018-11-20 01:31:06	~ben	huh ok
2018-11-20 01:32:13	tomasino	i'd be 100% on board with joining an openbsd tilde
2018-11-20 01:32:25	tomasino	i'd probably be pretty active too, since I'm struggling to learn it already
2018-11-20 01:32:29	ahriman	ill set it up when i get some spare cash
2018-11-20 01:33:24	~ben	i wouldn't mind providing a vps
2018-11-20 01:33:36	~ben	if you're short on cash
2018-11-20 01:35:32	ahriman	ill be able to do it soon i don't wanna use someone elses money, it'd make me kinda uncomfortable

2018-11-20 21:41:40	tomasino	it's a glue language that sits nicely on top of c and can access c libs natively
2018-11-20 21:41:56	tomasino	it got its biggest early bump in game programming in early 2000s

2018-11-21 00:09:45	deepend	biggest issue with HPUX is its not all that open.. but still fun since its closer to unix then linux is as far as I know.

2018-11-21 00:29:23	~ben	wb tomasino 
2018-11-21 00:29:31	tomasino	thanks
2018-11-21 00:29:34	tomasino	round robin ftw
2018-11-21 00:30:05	hyperboredoubt	What is Round Robin? It sounds familiar.
2018-11-21 00:31:19	~ben	in what context
2018-11-21 00:31:24	~ben	depends
2018-11-21 00:31:28	~ben	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin
2018-11-21 00:31:37	~ben	in this instance it was round robin dns
2018-11-21 00:31:49	~ben	where one dns name has multiple associated records
2018-11-21 00:36:29	hyperboredoubt	Hmmm, I understood some of those words.
2018-11-21 00:40:05	~ben	dns is a key=>value system for domain=>ip
2018-11-21 00:40:18	~ben	so for a certain key there are multiple values
2018-11-21 00:41:18	hyperboredoubt	What kinds of values?
2018-11-21 00:41:37	~ben	if you're on ~team or yourtilde, try the dig tool
2018-11-21 00:41:42	~ben	dig a tilde.chat
2018-11-21 00:41:44	~ben	and then 
2018-11-21 00:41:50	~ben	dig a irc.tilde.chat
2018-11-21 00:42:39	hyperboredoubt	What does it do?
2018-11-21 00:44:14	~ben	what does what do?
2018-11-21 00:44:19	~ben	did you try the commands?
2018-11-21 00:50:10	hyperboredoubt	No.
2018-11-21 00:50:16	hyperboredoubt	That's why I asked.
2018-11-21 00:53:33	deepend	why cant I address that much ram ben? :D 
2018-11-21 00:53:51	~ben	ah, the commands were meant to illustrate what i was talking about
2018-11-21 00:54:07	~ben	deepend: even with a 32 bit os, you can only address 4gb ram
2018-11-21 00:55:28	deepend	isn't 32bit :D 
2018-11-21 01:03:18	~ben	owo
2018-11-21 01:03:22	~ben	nevermind then
2018-11-21 01:07:06	deepend	yeah.. not the most powerful thing ever.. is 2 dual core CPU's running at 1.6Ghz. so 4 cores total. 20MB CPU Cache, 32GB Memory, and somewhere over 400GB of disk space currently.. only because it ignored my 320GB drives that are in it.. it just used my 3 smaller drives
2018-11-21 01:07:32	~ben	that's as much ram as my desktop has
2018-11-21 01:07:39	~ben	not scrawny at all
2018-11-21 01:07:47	~ben	(my laptop only has 8gb!)
2018-11-21 01:07:55	deepend	same.. well normally... i loaned 16GB of ram to a friend that was having memory issues lol 
2018-11-21 01:08:58	deepend	i pulled the 32GB out of the big server I have that im not really using.. since the server had over 100GB of ram it could spare 32 lol

2018-11-22 18:56:33	jan6	you can just delete old user, and possibly symlink the home dirs
2018-11-22 18:56:42	~ben	or just rename
2018-11-22 18:56:47	jan6	that too
2018-11-22 18:57:13	arne	yeah you could delet the user 
2018-11-22 18:57:54	jan6	symlink so that the home dir would correspond to the username, but if anyone used old one then not break stuff, though he most likely doesn't even need that, so you can just rename everything

2018-11-22 19:48:50	~ben	you definitely were crusading
2018-11-22 19:48:55	~ben	i'm looking at it now
2018-11-22 19:49:02	~ben	there were a lot of reasonable answers
2018-11-22 19:49:19	~ben	you've been barking up the wrong tree 
2018-11-22 19:49:30	~ben	"It was closed on Bugzilla because you cannot change wide‐reaching internet standards with a bug report."
2018-11-22 19:49:56	Shamar	Uhm... what I replied to this?
2018-11-22 19:50:45	~ben	you were snarky and a bit rude in the reply
2018-11-22 19:51:08	Shamar	Uhm... really?
2018-11-22 19:52:24	~ben	i can absolutely see why they would remove you from the premises. you seem to take a very fire-and-brimstone, bible thumping attitude to this issue which, while understandable i suppose, gets really fucking annoying if it's basically all you ever do and the bulk of what you ever talk about, especially when people have repeatedly reiterated to you that while your claims are valid, this is
2018-11-22 19:52:26	~ben	ultimately a trade-off that people made which would be bordering on impossible to fix without a radical upending of the system that will almost certainly never happen.
2018-11-22 19:52:32	~ben	^^ this exactly
2018-11-22 19:53:46	~ben	this was your response: https://tildes.net/~comp/8os/undetectable_remote_arbitrary_code_execution_attacks_through_javascript_and_http_headers_trickery#comment-29oi
2018-11-22 19:54:41	Shamar	I cannot see it anymore 
2018-11-22 19:55:37	~ben	I guess you don't know much about the "wide-reaching internet standards" you are talking about.
2018-11-22 19:55:39	~ben	I opened a bug report because these are Living Standards that follow the implementations.
2018-11-22 19:55:41	~ben	To fix these "Standards" you need to fix at least one implementation before.
2018-11-22 19:55:43	~ben	Also, I challenge you to find a line in the Standards we are talking about stating that JavaScript cannot be OPT-IN on a per website basis.
2018-11-22 19:55:45	~ben	Guess what?
2018-11-22 19:55:47	~ben	You don't need to violate any WHATWG's standard to implement these mitigations.
2018-11-22 19:55:49	~ben	very snarky
2018-11-22 19:57:00	Shamar	Hum... isn't on the exact same tone of the comment I waa replying too?
2018-11-22 19:57:11	~ben	no
2018-11-22 19:57:33	Shamar	uhm... mind to elaborate?
2018-11-22 19:57:53	~ben	their tone was not rude
2018-11-22 20:01:08	~ben	at some point if you are either unwilling or unable to take the hint people have been laying pretty thick on you, you're basically doing nothing but concern trolling by continually bringing things like this up and expecting people to have any more answers than what they've already given. that is antagonistic, and absolutely a cause for people telling you to fuck off from their website, whether
2018-11-22 20:01:10	~ben	you like it or not or think it's censorship or not.
2018-11-22 20:01:20	~ben	that's a quote from a comment on that thread ^^
2018-11-22 20:04:14	~ben	totally fair imo
2018-11-22 20:05:21	Shamar	Tbh re reading the quote you posted before about bible trumping and all I see my post on pair to such words..
2018-11-22 20:05:49	Shamar	Probably there's a cultural or language barrier at work
2018-11-22 20:06:11	Shamar	I don't think that tildes.net censored me
2018-11-22 20:06:43	Shamar	Lobste.rs censored some of my post that are not available anymore
2018-11-22 20:07:07	Shamar	But there's a difference between censorship and ban
2018-11-22 20:07:13	~ben	you're willfully misunderstanding what people are saying
2018-11-22 20:08:06	Shamar	No I'm not. If I'm misunderstanding something it's not willfully
2018-11-22 20:08:29	Shamar	But I think I'm not misunderstanding
2018-11-22 20:09:40	Shamar	They say: these attacks are not fixable without breaking the (business model of many company operating over) the Web
2018-11-22 20:09:43	~ben	you're still presenting the idea in the wrong way
2018-11-22 20:09:53	~ben	that's right, it's a risk of running js
2018-11-22 20:10:14	~ben	That's the thing. You're not technically wrong, you're just disingenuous. Purposefully misrepresenting things. For example instead of saying "There's a vulnerability with a handful of headers and some remote code execution and yep big browser doesn't want you to know," just come out and say what you mean off the bat instead of obfuscating it. "Javascript can be used to stab users in the back. How
2018-11-22 20:10:16	~ben	do we fix it without breaking it?" And that last bit is important. The solutions you propose will break the internet as it exists today. That's never going to get off the ground. Nobody will accept any solution that has that kind of cost. If you actually want anything fixed like you say you do, you need to work in ways that go with the grain.

2018-11-24 10:54:12	snurryboy	cheers
2018-11-24 10:55:19	snurryboy	ben i didn't realise znc was already installed i just compiled it in my directory
2018-11-24 10:55:42	snurryboy	just used to doing that cause with other shared shells i was never able to add all the modules i wanted
2018-11-24 11:25:44	snurryboy	yea i cant find znc-buildmod anywhere. i need it to compile modules
2018-11-24 11:27:41	snurryboy	yea it doesnt come up using locate
2018-11-24 11:27:52	@khuxkm|lounge	what modules to you need?

2018-11-24 11:27:55	sedbot	<khuxkm|lounge> what modules do you need?
2018-11-24 11:28:08	snurryboy	clientbuffer playback and mutter.py
2018-11-24 11:28:14	@khuxkm|lounge	also ben is asleep and won't be able to get back to you until morning
2018-11-24 11:28:25	@khuxkm|lounge	any links to source code?
2018-11-24 11:28:32	snurryboy	yea one sec
2018-11-24 11:29:07	snurryboy	https://github.com/CyberShadow/znc-clientbuffer
2018-11-24 11:29:12	snurryboy	https://github.com/jpnurmi/znc-playback
2018-11-24 11:29:16	snurryboy	https://bitbucket.org/jmclough/mutter-push
2018-11-24 11:30:21	snurryboy	mutter.py might work fine but clientbuffer and playback come as .cpp files that need either znc source directory to do ./configure or znc-buildmod otherwise
2018-11-24 11:31:46	snurryboy	if i compile znc in my directory i can get the .cpp files working fine but i have to use virtualenv to install python3 and requests in there too which i think should work fine now i know where python3.6 is
2018-11-24 11:31:56	@khuxkm	you may have to wait for ben on this one
2018-11-24 11:32:00	@khuxkm	I can't find it either
2018-11-24 11:32:24	snurryboy	yea its the same with the last couple of shells i used for some reason znc-buildmod isn't installed
2018-11-24 11:50:01	snurryboy	yea i'll just compile it myself. gives me more control anyway

2018-11-24 18:46:29	Shamar	Thare must be a language issue or something like that
2018-11-24 18:47:21	jan6	both that and different thinking circuits
2018-11-24 18:47:46	Shamar	jan6 oh.. sorry I did got the process but I thought you were actually assigned it... 
2018-11-24 18:48:22	Shamar	jan6 different thinking circuit? What do you mean?
2018-11-24 18:49:19	jan6	nothing, just different way of thinking, cause brains are just organic analog computers
2018-11-24 18:49:55	Shamar	t
2018-11-24 18:50:02	jan6	t?
2018-11-24 18:50:21	Shamar	shitty terminal 
2018-11-24 18:50:49	jan6	which one?
2018-11-24 18:52:33	Shamar	For sure we have different way of thinking... but this should be a good reason to discuss 
2018-11-24 18:53:25	Shamar	Just, when we talk about technical stuffs we should stick to technical stuffs...
2018-11-24 18:54:14	Shamar	Anyway computers compute, brains think
2018-11-24 18:57:41	jan6	thinking is just computing as well, the neurons all follow specific rules, just like transistors
2018-11-24 19:16:44	Shamar	I don't agree on this: to compute you need data, our minds work with informations (that data can represent) and insights that cannot be represented at all
2018-11-24 19:20:56	jan6	everything can be represented, just like you can draw a representation of a 3d cube on a 2d sheet of paper
2018-11-24 19:21:25	jan6	or how you can represent an image with a bunch of bits
2018-11-24 19:22:31	Shamar	not everything... how can you represent a feeling or a mystical experience?
2018-11-24 19:24:05	Shamar	Not everything in our mind can really be communicated
2018-11-24 19:25:38	Shamar	While there's no datum that a computer hold and cannot be communicated to another computer or hunan
2018-11-24 19:26:01	Shamar	s/hunan/human
2018-11-24 19:26:02	sedbot	<Shamar> While there's no datum that a computer hold and cannot be communicated to another computer or human
2018-11-24 19:26:51	jan6	as I said though, organic ANALOG computer
2018-11-24 19:33:06	Shamar	What cannot be described mathematically cannot be computed... it's not a problem of analog vs digital, it's just that it cannot be computed.
2018-11-24 19:35:21	jan6	"What cannot be described mathematically cannot be computed." your brain can, though, THEORETICALLY you can still describe every propery of the atoms making up your brain in a specific point in time
2018-11-24 19:37:57	Shamar	I don't get what you mean... 
2018-11-24 19:42:37	jan6	nothing
2018-11-24 19:50:13	Shamar	I cannot describe a lot of properties of the atoms of my brain... as many of such properties are quantistic
2018-11-24 19:52:46	jan6	quantum waveforms
2018-11-24 19:56:06	Shamar	Afaik they doesn’t provide much predictability
2018-11-24 19:57:42	 *	jan6 drops the discussion cause no points are being made and topic is slipping into intangible metaphysics
2018-11-24 20:03:45	Shamar	It was metaphysical from the very beginning, saying that brains are just organic analog computers is a metaphysical statement
2018-11-24 20:04:54	jan6	sure

2018-11-25 00:47:27	tomasino	you can override hacker.css in your own stylesheet

2018-11-25 01:22:18	ubergeek|lounge	You will also need to use the name servers on the .tilde wiki

2018-11-25 01:53:08	ubergeek|lounge	Not yet, just a personal repo
2018-11-25 01:53:45	ubergeek|lounge	Should probably move it to an org
2018-11-25 01:54:41	ubergeek|lounge	Since it seems to be gaining some legs.  We have e three authoritative name servers so far :)
2018-11-25 01:57:16	@khuxkm|lounge	ooh neat
2018-11-25 02:01:06	fosslinux	i'm going to be setting up a dns server in the next month or so ubergeek|lounge, if you give me instructions then , i can be another name server :D

2018-11-25 02:21:54	fosslinux	but why
2018-11-25 02:21:57	ubergeek|lounge	You can't read /etc/shadow though
2018-11-25 02:22:04	fosslinux	isn't that a little bit bad?
2018-11-25 02:22:11	fosslinux	on all m y servers /etc/apsswd is locked down
2018-11-25 02:22:19	ubergeek|lounge	It needs to be readable, so you can log in
2018-11-25 02:23:02	fosslinux	oh duh
2018-11-25 02:23:08	ubergeek|lounge	It's not a big deal, as you cannot write to /etc/passwd
2018-11-25 02:23:12	fosslinux	yeah
2018-11-25 02:23:23	fosslinux	nvm
2018-11-25 02:27:56	~ben	/etc/passwd is meant to be readable
2018-11-25 02:28:07	~ben	nothing actually sensitive in there
2018-11-25 02:37:51	dokuja	at least since shadow
2018-11-25 02:45:54	~ben	yup
2018-11-25 02:54:05	@khuxkm|lounge	apparently going to chat.tilde redirects to bsd.tilde.team
2018-11-25 02:57:10	~ben	huh?
2018-11-25 02:57:37	~ben	it's the same roundrobin

2018-11-25 03:07:43	@khuxkm|lounge	well I think that may be part of it
2018-11-25 03:07:51	@khuxkm|lounge	it round-robins to bsd.tilde.chat
2018-11-25 03:08:05	~ben	yes that's one of the ircds in the roundrobin
2018-11-25 03:08:49	@khuxkm|lounge	I thought I'd be able to access the site tho
2018-11-25 03:09:18	ubergeek|lounge	What address is the wrong one? I just pulled the addresses in irc.chat.team
2018-11-25 03:09:50	ubergeek|lounge	I can pull it if needed
2018-11-25 03:10:00	@khuxkm|lounge	no it's fine

2018-11-25 03:56:57	ubergeek	Those should replicated from the repo ~ midnight for ns1.tilde (There's a cron to do it)

2018-11-25 03:58:27	@khuxkm|lounge	do we have a non-.tilde way to access nameservers? (like, ns1.tilde.tildenet.com or whatever?)
2018-11-25 04:00:09	ubergeek	What do you mean?
2018-11-25 04:00:28	ubergeek	There's a list of IPs you can hit

2018-11-25 04:00:50	@khuxkm	nvm, there's a lot of ideas I'm having that involve using the domains that ben sits on :P
2018-11-25 04:01:09	@khuxkm	we have lots of domains and use (I believe at last count) a little under half of them
2018-11-25 04:01:52	~ben	nsX.tildeverse.org?
2018-11-25 04:02:10	tomasino	khuxkm: shoot me an email at tomasino@lavabit.com with your username for the server, first ship's name, and an ssh pubkey
2018-11-25 04:02:11	ubergeek	I'm ok with that, unless it interferes with standard-root zone name servers

2018-11-25 04:09:16	~ben	that's an alias for tilde.chat 
2018-11-25 04:09:17	@khuxkm|lounge	since it would literally be the .tilde net

2018-11-25 04:11:11	~ben	tildeverse seems more appropriate
2018-11-25 04:11:12	ubergeek	yeah, no strong feelings either way
2018-11-25 04:11:13	~ben	but it's fine
2018-11-25 04:11:37	ubergeek	For most folks, the IPs would be the important part.
2018-11-25 04:12:47	deepend	oh talking ns names? :D  very nice
2018-11-25 04:13:31	deepend	suprised you dont use tildenet.org for the irc network personally :P 
2018-11-25 04:13:59	ubergeek	if we do use tildenet for irc, next year, we can go to other IRC nets, and do Floodsgiving :/
2018-11-25 04:14:37	deepend	lol
2018-11-25 04:14:51	deepend	brb.. going to store..

2018-11-25 04:26:27	fosslinux	oh lol

2018-11-25 06:59:54	snurryboy	ben is there a way to add modules to the znc you have installed? znc-buildmod doesnt seem to be installed. i compiled it myself and it sorta works and i have the playback module loaded but its not working for some reason
2018-11-25 07:00:43	~ben	tbh i'm not sure
2018-11-25 07:00:51	~ben	it's just the debian package
2018-11-25 07:00:55	~ben	i don't use it myself 
2018-11-25 07:03:30	snurryboy	is there any way i can or if not you can format my user? I think either reinstalling znc the second time or using virtualenv did something wrong cause when i got to make with znc there were a few error kind of things with the install. it said it completed successfully but i have a feeling something is off
2018-11-25 07:03:47	~ben	format what?
2018-11-25 07:03:49	snurryboy	i cant use apt to remove it completely im pretty sure
2018-11-25 07:04:05	~ben	znc-buildmod isn't an apt package
2018-11-25 07:04:06	snurryboy	my user directory back to stock
2018-11-25 07:04:27	fosslinux	rm -r directoryofwhichyoubuildto
2018-11-25 07:04:32	snurryboy	no i mean the actually znc itself the one i compilied myself in my directory
2018-11-25 07:04:36	fosslinux	yes
2018-11-25 07:04:42	~ben	yeah just rm the install dir
2018-11-25 07:04:45	fosslinux	it will be installed in $HOME somewhere
2018-11-25 07:04:53	fosslinux	did you add it to your $PATH
2018-11-25 07:04:55	~ben	what do you get with `which znc`
2018-11-25 07:05:18	snurryboy	i have removed .znc and also tried make uninstall make clean and make distclean
2018-11-25 07:06:00	fosslinux	ben | what do you get with `which znc`
2018-11-25 07:06:02	fosslinux	do that
2018-11-25 07:06:16	~ben	.znc is just configs iirc 
2018-11-25 07:06:18	~ben	right?
2018-11-25 07:06:29	snurryboy	well its installed atm but its in .local/bin/znc
2018-11-25 07:06:44	snurryboy	yea i removed that too before
2018-11-25 07:06:59	snurryboy	i can recompile and show you the errors that show up
2018-11-25 07:07:16	snurryboy	i mean it may not even be a problem im not sure. its running fine but playback isnt working
2018-11-25 07:07:24	~ben	that might be client-side
2018-11-25 07:07:31	~ben	weechat?
2018-11-25 07:07:34	snurryboy	say if i disconnect my client and come back 30mins later it doesnt load the buffer
2018-11-25 07:07:39	snurryboy	no mutter on ios
2018-11-25 07:07:53	~ben	ah i'm not familiar
2018-11-25 07:08:10	snurryboy	when i do /znc loadmod playback it says its already loaded
2018-11-25 07:08:18	snurryboy	but it def isnt functioning correctly
2018-11-25 07:08:28	fosslinux	why do you want to recompile
2018-11-25 07:09:14	~ben	i don't know enough about znc 
2018-11-25 07:09:30	~ben	weechat and weechat-android has been sufficient 4 me
2018-11-25 07:09:36	snurryboy	because i cant compile mods on the znc thats installed on the system
2018-11-25 07:10:04	snurryboy	yea i wouldnt need it but iOS disconnects most apps that are in the background so znc is essential for irc on the phone
2018-11-25 07:10:07	~ben	is there a package i can install or something?
2018-11-25 07:10:46	snurryboy	im not sure. i thought znc-buildmod came with the package it does when i compile my own
2018-11-25 07:10:57	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-25 07:10:58	fosslinux	i sec
2018-11-25 07:10:59	fosslinux	1 sec
2018-11-25 07:11:12	snurryboy	but i guess you could run make with the modules inside your znc src directory if you have one
2018-11-25 07:12:07	snurryboy	2 of them come as .cpp files you put in  source/modules
2018-11-25 07:12:17	snurryboy	then run make then make install
2018-11-25 07:12:18	~ben	znc-perl and znc-pythong are already installed
2018-11-25 07:12:35	~ben	i just did apt install znc
2018-11-25 07:12:48	~ben	the system one is from the package
2018-11-25 07:13:05	fosslinux	ususally its easier to get ben to install the package than compile it yourself
2018-11-25 07:13:10	snurryboy	yea ok im not sure about that cause ive only ever used it on shared shells so ive never used apt 
2018-11-25 07:14:03	snurryboy	i guess if you use apt then you dont have a source directory for znc. the only other way to compile modules is with znc-buildmod and it looks like apt doesnt install that with it
2018-11-25 07:14:10	snurryboy	if it did i would be able to use it myself
2018-11-25 07:14:12	~ben	there's no apt package for znc-buildmod
2018-11-25 07:14:45	snurryboy	yea it might be a znc-dev or something ill look it up
2018-11-25 07:15:00	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-25 07:15:08	fosslinux	rm -rf ~/.znc
2018-11-25 07:15:17	fosslinux	(dont normally run rm -rf
2018-11-25 07:15:23	fosslinux	its dangerous)
2018-11-25 07:16:02	snurryboy	If you have the source code for a module, there are multiple ways to compile it.
2018-11-25 07:16:02	snurryboy	Please note: If you have installed ZNC from your distro's repository you also need to install the dev package of ZNC (usually znc-dev or znc-devel) for building your own modules.
2018-11-25 07:16:18	~ben	oh ok i can install znc-dev
2018-11-25 07:16:18	snurryboy	https://wiki.znc.in/Compiling_modules
2018-11-25 07:16:31	~ben	installed
2018-11-25 07:17:03	snurryboy	awesome cheers that should work fine. ill clean my directory and give it a shot 
2018-11-25 07:17:45	~ben	np
2018-11-25 07:18:03	~ben	sry for the lack of proper znc setup
2018-11-25 07:19:16	snurryboy	nah its cool. a bouncer really aint that important for most people. the only other way to keep a connection to IRC on iOS is pay the subscription to IRCCloud which is basically a host with a bouncer installed lol
2018-11-25 07:19:43	~ben	does thelounge work on ios?
2018-11-25 07:19:51	~ben	cause that has a web client that should work
2018-11-25 07:20:00	~ben	run webirc from your ~team shell
2018-11-25 07:20:08	~ben	then go to https://irc.tilde.team
2018-11-25 07:20:12	~ben	might be worth a try
2018-11-25 07:21:08	snurryboy	im not sure never used it. i like znc tho cause theres the mutter.py module that will give you notifications on your phone when highlighted even when the client is in the background and disconnected
2018-11-25 07:21:22	~ben	yeah that's how i have weechat set up
2018-11-25 07:21:23	snurryboy	ill have a look at the lounge thing tho
2018-11-25 07:21:25	~ben	with weechat-android
2018-11-25 07:21:33	~ben	thelounge is pretty dope for a webclient
2018-11-25 07:21:59	snurryboy	ok i gotta take the dog for a walk. ill finish this when i get back and let you know how it goes
2018-11-25 07:25:10	~ben	heh ok glhf
2018-11-25 07:25:18	~ben	i'm heading to bed
2018-11-25 07:53:02	~ben	.tilde domains now resolve on here
2018-11-25 09:03:20	snurryboy	anyone familiar with znc on this host?
2018-11-25 09:04:25	snurryboy	ive got it set up and znc has connected to a server but trying to connect my client to znc i am getting a connection error
2018-11-25 09:04:46	snurryboy	it connected when i compiled it myself but not now with the znc installed on the server
2018-11-25 09:05:17	snurryboy	ive tried connecting both to tilde.team and localhost
2018-11-25 09:05:40	snurryboy	tried it with and without tunnelling 
2018-11-25 09:16:58	snurryboy	nvm added a new listen port and that works
2018-11-25 09:17:05	snurryboy	hopefully the playback module does too
2018-11-25 11:42:51	snurryboy	hmmmm playback isnt working just like before
2018-11-25 17:46:20	~ben	:(
2018-11-25 22:18:14	tildebeast	knock me down with a feather. just discovered that xfce has an 'application finder' app by hitting a random shortcut key :)

2018-11-26 14:14:25	snurryboy	playback module on znc isnt working. i'm sure what the problem is. i was thinking maybe something to do with ports and tunnelling but really im stumped 
2018-11-26 14:17:18	edwardthefma	Have you removed and reinstalled znc 
2018-11-26 14:17:44	edwardthefma	Perhaps you should reset your configuration
2018-11-26 14:18:04	cdmnky	snurryboy: are you still signed in somewhere? I set up thelounge to use my znc and if I don't manually disconnect, the playback won't happen
2018-11-26 14:19:55	snurryboy	yea it doesn't work regardless of whatever configuration im using
2018-11-26 14:20:16	snurryboy	im using it along with clientbuffer so i can have buffer separated by client
2018-11-26 14:20:47	cdmnky	hmm
2018-11-26 14:21:27	snurryboy	yea im clueless. ive got the mutter.py module loaded to and it works fine
2018-11-26 14:21:40	snurryboy	its for my phones client to give notifications while disconnected
2018-11-26 14:22:13	snurryboy	i looked on the wiki and it had a couple of options to try if it wasnt working but it didnt work
2018-11-26 14:22:36	cdmnky	znc can be a pain sometimes
2018-11-26 14:22:38	snurryboy	it could be a setting tho
2018-11-26 14:32:00	~ben	wish i knew more on znc
2018-11-26 14:36:40	snurryboy	yea me too lmao

2018-11-26 14:37:23	~ben	should already be created
2018-11-26 14:37:32	~ben	welcome to the tilde team architector4 !
2018-11-26 14:38:21	snurryboy	but yea i dunno what's going on cause i thought znc did playback buffer on stock but its just that it plays the full buffer every time you connect. and im not getting any buffer at all
2018-11-26 14:38:33	edwardthefma	I want to win the powerball
2018-11-26 14:40:17	edwardthefma	Rm -r .znc
2018-11-26 14:40:40	edwardthefma	Then znc -c
2018-11-26 14:41:05	edwardthefma	Time for a new install
2018-11-26 14:42:12	~ben	yeah i thought that was one of the benefits of running znc
2018-11-26 14:42:42	edwardthefma	You might want to ask around in #znc on irc.freenode.net
2018-11-26 14:43:12	edwardthefma	If you still have problems
2018-11-26 14:46:43	snurryboy	whats -c?
2018-11-26 14:46:49	snurryboy	i usually do znc --makeconf
2018-11-26 14:46:52	snurryboy	to start
2018-11-26 14:47:07	snurryboy	but yea i can try a reinstall i guess
2018-11-26 14:47:23	snurryboy	if it dont work still ill ask in freenode tomorrow

2018-11-26 15:12:43	midlow	or is it a bad idea
2018-11-26 15:13:23	ubergeek	I'll lol if you chmod your homedir 111

2018-11-26 15:14:38	midlow	wtf is "Other" though
2018-11-26 15:14:45	midlow	there's user, group and other
2018-11-26 15:14:49	midlow	but what does it mean by other
2018-11-26 15:14:55	ubergeek	other people, not in your primary group
2018-11-26 15:15:03	~ben	something that doesn't match user or group
2018-11-26 15:15:05	ubergeek	(Or directory group ownership)
2018-11-26 15:15:49	~ben	group also applies to secondary groups
2018-11-26 15:16:05	midlow	i give up i dont even know about groups
2018-11-26 15:16:41	midlow	i just dont want people to look at my shit
2018-11-26 15:16:42	ubergeek	You probbaly don't want to mess with your homedir's permissions then, excepting maybe +x
2018-11-26 15:16:43	~ben	did you read the wiki page?
2018-11-26 15:16:51	~ben	it explains it pretty well
2018-11-26 15:17:00	ubergeek	midlow: that's like 90% of what a tilde server is for.
2018-11-26 15:17:30	midlow	then i'll experience the other 10%
2018-11-26 15:17:35	ubergeek	ie, I want people to be able to see what is in ~ubergeek/bin, because it may be useful.  Or my public_hhtml, etc etc
2018-11-26 15:17:45	ubergeek	I don't think you get tildes.
2018-11-26 15:18:03	midlow	yeah but i dont want them to look in a specific folder where i store m ysuper secret ascii art midget porn
2018-11-26 15:18:34	ubergeek	chmod that dir oug-rwx
2018-11-26 15:18:48	ubergeek	Nobody will get in that directory then
2018-11-26 15:19:19	~ben	chmod 700 maybe
2018-11-26 15:19:38	midlow	ok so
2018-11-26 15:19:53	midlow	user is me, group is ??? and other is the rest of tilde?

2018-11-28 18:30:32	ubergeek	what is the actual command line you are using?
2018-11-28 18:30:44	cdmnky	$ gopher
2018-11-28 18:30:47	ubergeek	"gopher tilde.team"
2018-11-28 18:30:59	ubergeek	it doesn't have a page to load
2018-11-28 18:31:17	cdmnky	that didn't work either, I tried 'gopher sdf.org' too
2018-11-28 18:31:54	aewens	Simple solution, just use HTTP(S) instead of gopher /s
2018-11-28 18:32:01	cdmnky	lol
2018-11-28 18:32:18	aewens	I hear most pages are already using it already
2018-11-28 18:35:12	jan6	make a http -> gopher proxy, lol
2018-11-28 18:35:36	cdmnky	jan6: http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/
2018-11-28 18:37:14	~ben	cdmnky: https://gopher.tilde.team
2018-11-28 18:38:24	jan6	that's the wrong way
2018-11-28 18:38:38	jan6	it's gopher -> http
2018-11-28 18:38:48	jan6	it's what everyone's doing
2018-11-28 18:41:28	jan6	I want the other way
2018-11-28 18:41:41	~ben	you want http in gopher?
2018-11-28 18:41:57	jan6	why not ;P
2018-11-28 18:50:43	~ben	ytho
2018-11-28 18:50:50	~ben	write a gopher cgi thing for it
2018-11-28 18:59:28	aewens	Part of the problem with http(s) -> gopher is that most http(s) webpages assume a browser rendering their html/css/js components where gopher does none of that.
2018-11-28 19:00:01	aewens	Making gopher -> http is simple enough because it does not require anything from http that it doesn't do already, where the opposite is not true
2018-11-28 19:03:51	~ben	that too
2018-11-28 19:05:23	jan6	http doesn't MEAN html
2018-11-28 19:06:01	jan6	you can just use a browser to browse it
2018-11-28 19:06:14	jan6	and there IS a html datatype, iirc
2018-11-28 19:07:42	aewens	jan6: My argument is that the majority/plurality of the HTTP usage consumed by users is in html/css/js format
2018-11-28 19:11:42	~ben	https://bhh.sh/u/20181128-141042.png
2018-11-28 19:12:19	aewens	Nice meme +999
2018-11-28 19:12:51	jan6	what I'm saying is that html isn't an issue, and probably css/js not that much either
2018-11-28 19:13:13	jan6	nice meme, old one
2018-11-28 19:13:18	jan6	also too accurate
2018-11-28 19:15:21	aewens	I'm not saying html is an issue, I'm saying the combination of html/css/js is an issue. There's a reason people are fussing about javascript, so many people are now dynamically rendering their sites that serving a static page to gopher from it would not be trivial to accomplish
2018-11-28 19:16:21	jan6	just kill those sites with fire
2018-11-28 19:16:23	jan6	ez pz
2018-11-28 19:16:33	aewens	On a side note, I'm mildly planning to ditch both HTTP(S) and gopher and make my own protocol. The Internet is doomed and and I'm paving a new way to the promise land.
2018-11-28 19:18:01	jan6	lol
2018-11-28 19:18:06	jan6	not too bad of an idea
2018-11-28 19:18:23	jan6	there already are a bunch of kinda-alternatives
2018-11-28 19:18:33	jan6	stuff like zeronet and things
2018-11-28 19:18:45	jan6	zeronet is KEWL
2018-11-28 19:19:18	aewens	Part of this is driven by paranoia, so zeronet too is tainted by not being created by me.
2018-11-28 19:20:19	aewens	The tricky part is coming up with a new cryptographic algorithm because the current crypto libraries could have backdoors for governments and we cannot be having any of that.
2018-11-28 19:21:15	jan6	just don't use any LIBRARIES, dummy
2018-11-28 19:21:28	jan6	make your own based on the specifications
2018-11-28 19:24:26	jan6	text through specific setting of little text ciphers (enigma-box style, with selection of stuff like vinegere and caesars and anything else, according to the user inputted seed) over sha256 verified pgp?
2018-11-28 19:25:10	jan6	the message in pgp is verified, signed, and then verified again, of course
2018-11-28 19:26:18	jan6	this way I'd estimate it to be near impossible to bruteforce without some VERY heavy resources
2018-11-28 19:26:47	jan6	oh, and then just encode it in a custom encoding like base256 just for giggles
2018-11-28 19:27:31	jan6	NOBODY's gonna bruteforce that, unless they have some supercomputers from the future
2018-11-28 19:28:28	jan6	course it'll be a lot bigger than original message but if you REALLY wanted to bee custom privatee, then why not, eh?
2018-11-28 19:36:11	aewens	jan6: As someone who works at a company that sells supercomputers, I happen to have the ability to bruteforce a lot of things if I really wanted to
2018-11-28 19:36:33	ubergeek	Don't make your own crypto algo...
2018-11-28 19:36:35	aewens	And my issue is not the mathy side of things, but the non-sense part of security like timing attacks and stuff like that
2018-11-28 19:37:09	ubergeek	Plenty of crypto algos and libs have been, and are currently, heavily tested, and proven
2018-11-28 19:37:17	aewens	ubergeek: I'd more be making my own implementation of a crypto algo for the sole context of using in my own Internet protocol.
2018-11-28 19:37:57	ubergeek	I personally wouldn't do that either.  Nothing wrong with using tls libs, that are FOSS.  They are constantly tested
2018-11-28 19:38:22	ubergeek	Even the cipher specs used in openssh are heavily tested.
2018-11-28 19:38:31	aewens	If I were to use any, that's what I'd do. Like I said, right now it's just a thought in my head that I've made no actions upon yet.
2018-11-28 19:40:00	aewens	My main concern is using any NIST produced algoritms / curves that many security libraries like to adopt.
2018-11-28 19:41:10	ubergeek	If they are FOSS, it doesn't matter who wrote it really
2018-11-28 19:41:17	aewens	I want my Internet to be a home-brewed, paranoia safe haven for wackos like me. And it seems like a fun(ny) project to take on.
2018-11-28 19:41:26	ubergeek	:)
2018-11-28 19:42:33	aewens	And yeah, it does because if they use something like ecdsa but use curves selected by NIST they could be vulnerable to backdoors from the math perspective (not necessarily software designed ones)
2018-11-28 19:43:15	aewens	See curve25519 used in libssh for an example on this kinda stuff.

2018-11-29 02:30:44	ubergeek	user disk quotas set to 2MB?
2018-11-29 02:30:57	ubergeek	soft quota, of course.  Hard quota a 5MB...
2018-11-29 02:31:17	tomasino	are we having disk space issues?
2018-11-29 02:31:21	~ben	the two options i'm thinking of are disk quotas or moving to an identically priced dedi that has hdd instead of ssd
2018-11-29 02:31:34	~ben	yeah we were down to 25gb free the other day
2018-11-29 02:31:36	~ben	:x
2018-11-29 02:31:36	tomasino	disk quotas!
2018-11-29 02:31:41	ubergeek	I *believe* spinning rust is just fine
2018-11-29 02:31:51	tomasino	as someone who doesn't abuse disk space i'm in favor of that
2018-11-29 02:31:53	ubergeek	I don't think we're running any high perfomance hadoop jobs
2018-11-29 02:31:58	~ben	lol no we're not
2018-11-29 02:32:18	~ben	68gb free atm
2018-11-29 02:32:26	ubergeek	And I do not think the web server is serving 10K hpm for a Go web apps
2018-11-29 02:32:26	tomasino	that's bigger than my whole vm
2018-11-29 02:32:45	tomasino	of course, i'm only hosting text, hopefully
2018-11-29 02:34:36	~ben	for the same price i could swap to a box with 32gb ram and 8tb storage or same ram and 4gb hdd
2018-11-29 02:35:06	tomasino	well, that sounds like a good deal
2018-11-29 02:35:11	tomasino	and 5mb quotas
2018-11-29 02:35:16	tomasino	you can have ALL THE USERS
2018-11-29 02:35:26	~ben	lol yes!
2018-11-29 02:35:33	tomasino	but no, not 5mb. i'm hosting my cyoa archives on your box
2018-11-29 02:35:41	~ben	oh yeah go for it
2018-11-29 02:35:42	tomasino	they're like 80mb a piece
2018-11-29 02:35:53	~ben	that's not a big deal at all
2018-11-29 02:36:03	~ben	ámcclure has like 23gb in his $HOME atm
2018-11-29 02:36:09	tomasino	you say that now, but what about after i do cyoa for the next 50 years!
2018-11-29 02:36:14	tomasino	your ancient VM is gonna be very sad then
2018-11-29 02:36:26	~ben	lol that would probably still be less than what ámcclure has
2018-11-29 02:36:31	tomasino	hrm, probably
2018-11-29 02:36:46	~ben	not pinging him cause i've bothered him enough about it 
2018-11-29 02:36:48	ubergeek	I vote for 5MB quotas, no matter how we go
2018-11-29 02:36:50	~ben	for now
2018-11-29 02:36:54	ubergeek	and, heading to bed.  night all
2018-11-29 02:36:59	~ben	night!
2018-11-29 02:37:22	~ben	just throwing it out there about maybe swapping to a different box with hdd
2018-11-29 02:37:28	tomasino	night ubergeek 
2018-11-29 02:37:51	~ben	moar storage
2018-11-29 02:37:54	~ben	could run more stuff on there
2018-11-29 02:37:58	tomasino	just move amcclure to a new storage volume!
2018-11-29 02:38:05	~ben	lol on floppies
2018-11-29 02:38:24	~ben	i think it's still refugee stuff from the thunix shutdown
2018-11-29 02:39:14	~ben	oh the disks are raid 1 so it's only 2tb 
2018-11-29 02:39:16	~ben	on the 64gb one
2018-11-29 02:39:34	~ben	that negates some of the read performance loss though
2018-11-29 03:29:55	amcclure	got it down to 11 gb and hopefully lower and lower soon
2018-11-29 03:30:15	amcclure	I'm very sorry for using up so much space for so long
2018-11-29 03:35:05	~ben	heh no worries
2018-11-29 03:35:21	~ben	just would be nice to know if you're going to use that much
2018-11-29 03:35:28	~ben	it was scary to see we were that low on space

2018-11-29 04:37:32	deepend	yep.. ovh you could have your cake and eat it to. lol
2018-11-29 04:37:50	~ben	is there a setup fee?
2018-11-29 04:38:03	~ben	i'd like to keep the primary ip too...
2018-11-29 04:38:08	deepend	sometimes
2018-11-29 04:38:31	deepend	depends on thier mood i think..LMAO and what direction the wind is blowing
2018-11-29 04:40:57	deepend	57.99CDN would get you 32GB ram and 3x2TB drives
2018-11-29 04:41:45	deepend	so 47.99 US
2018-11-29 04:41:59	deepend	switched from the canadian site to the US site
2018-11-29 04:43:01	~ben	i can get 32gb ram and 2x4tb for 35eur
2018-11-29 04:43:13	~ben	or 64gb ram and 2x2tb for 35eur
2018-11-29 04:45:14	deepend	guess I just like having closer servers with enterprise hardware.. I would never lease a server with consumer hardware to run servers on :D  but thats just me :)
2018-11-29 04:46:17	~ben	ah i suppose that's fair
2018-11-29 04:47:21	deepend	EX61  get this one if your moving within hetzner.. lol  2x6TB
2018-11-29 04:48:00	deepend	and is a i7 8700 which is 6 core 12 thread
2018-11-29 04:48:14	slipyx	only 6
2018-11-29 04:48:16	slipyx	psh
2018-11-29 04:48:28	deepend	better then the 4 core 8 thread he has right now
2018-11-29 04:49:53	~ben	i might be able to be convinced
2018-11-29 04:50:21	deepend	since even in raid you'd have 6TB lol
2018-11-29 04:50:24	~ben	might as well do the PX61 though
2018-11-29 04:50:33	slipyx	give him some more wine
2018-11-29 04:50:53	~ben	that's actual server hardward instead of desktop i7s
2018-11-29 04:51:03	deepend	the 6 core i7 would be a better chip then the 4 core xeon

2018-11-29 05:11:51	~ben	ingress is not counted towards that

2018-11-29 06:21:55	deepend	dedis are ok cuz your not sharing resources
2018-11-29 06:22:27	deepend	but obviously u couldn't mine bitcoin with it.. but there are coins you could mine with that type of hardware
2018-11-29 06:22:32	~ben	yeah no gpu
2018-11-29 06:23:00	slipyx	weve seen what happens with that
2018-11-29 06:23:01	~ben	could do a nextcloud instance and everything
2018-11-29 06:23:06	deepend	bitcoin isn;t evne realistically doable with a gpu either.. the dificulty of the network is too high
2018-11-29 06:23:09	~ben	thunix 2.0 no thanks
2018-11-29 06:27:08	deepend	but..
2018-11-29 06:27:39	deepend	you could get 4x2TB 64GB of ram and newer version of same processor 6c/12thread for 83.99 on soyoustart
2018-11-29 06:28:07	deepend	its not 128GB of ram.. but has enough of everything else
2018-11-29 06:28:29	deepend	or 2x480GB for same price
2018-11-29 06:29:36	deepend	and would offer better pings. .. only other downside is setup fee :(
2018-11-29 06:29:48	~ben	auction servers don't have a setup feeeeeeeee
2018-11-29 06:30:26	deepend	yep i know. just making suggestions :)  since I'm sure 128G of  ram and 100 bucks ish US isn't always an easy pill to swallow :) 
2018-11-29 06:31:33	~ben	don't really have anything that would use the ram properly 
2018-11-29 06:31:35	~ben	lol
2018-11-29 06:31:38	deepend	well the 128G of ram isnt hard to swallow. the price might be. setup fees are only one time thing.. so thats like 3 months of the difference in price between the OVH and hetzner option
2018-11-29 06:32:01	~ben	right
2018-11-29 06:32:19	~ben	oooooor i could just stay with what we have
2018-11-29 06:32:23	~ben	and turn on disk quota
2018-11-29 06:32:31	deepend	always option yup :) 
2018-11-29 06:32:55	~ben	there's also the hdd version of the same box
2018-11-29 06:33:05	~ben	ugh but setup fee again
2018-11-29 06:33:39	deepend	everyone.. send 1 dollar via paypal.. to ben@tilde.team.. show some love ..LMAO jk

2018-11-29 06:34:36	~ben	my total hosting costs come out to about $50/month
2018-11-29 06:34:47	~ben	including a couple VPSs
2018-11-29 06:34:57	~ben	this would at least double it
2018-11-29 06:35:14	deepend	with 128GB of ram you could just ditch all the other machines and us some sort of virtualization on the big ass server

2018-11-29 06:35:59	deepend	hell even with 64 still doable.. shutty part is.. now I"m tempted to switch my server to the 6c/12t server.. 
2018-11-29 06:36:03	~ben	  One additional IP with costs (Price (monthly): € 0.84 / Setup (once): € 0.00)
2018-11-29 06:36:05	~ben	  One failover IP (Price (monthly): € 4.20 / Setup (once): € 0.00)
2018-11-29 06:36:07	~ben	  One additional subnet /29 (Price (monthly): € 6.72 / Setup (once): € 0.00)
2018-11-29 06:36:09	~ben	  One additional subnet /28 (Price (monthly): € 13.45 / Setup (once): € 0.00)
2018-11-29 06:36:11	~ben	  One additional subnet /27 (Price (monthly): € 26.89 / Setup (once): € 0.00)
2018-11-29 06:36:25	~ben	i guess i could do a /29
2018-11-29 06:36:54	deepend	or goto ovh.. and only pay 1.5 upfront per ip and no monthly fees after that
2018-11-29 06:36:58	~ben	and i'd need to figure out a slick way to handle vms
2018-11-29 06:37:01	deepend	or is it 3.5
2018-11-29 06:37:03	deepend	cant' remember
2018-11-29 06:37:05	deepend	lol
2018-11-29 06:37:17	deepend	virtualbox does me well
2018-11-29 06:37:20	~ben	should grabbed on on blackfriday sale
2018-11-29 06:37:22	deepend	so far
2018-11-29 06:37:35	slipyx	just buy 128 pi's and host from home
2018-11-29 06:37:51	~ben	would only need 127 pi's lol
2018-11-29 06:38:00	slipyx	youll get more cores too
2018-11-29 06:38:10	deepend	I use virtualbox with phpvirtualbox for ease of management. 
2018-11-29 06:39:42	~ben	never heard of that
2018-11-29 06:40:08	deepend	it works pretty good. 
2018-11-29 06:40:39	deepend	i'll send you a screenshot of my server
2018-11-29 06:41:06	~ben	i've been using lxd as you've probably heard me talk about
2018-11-29 06:41:15	~ben	networking is the annoying part
2018-11-29 07:01:33	fosslinux	ben: i think you should just do the ssd->hdd  - don't sacrifice the ram
2018-11-29 07:01:47	~ben	ok
2018-11-29 07:02:21	fosslinux	ben: dont get it its not worth the price
2018-11-29 07:02:33	fosslinux	just reading scroll back
2018-11-29 07:02:37	fosslinux	and making comments
2018-11-29 07:03:07	~ben	lol
2018-11-29 07:03:11	~ben	i might try it for a month and see
2018-11-29 07:03:15	~ben	if it's worth it
2018-11-29 07:03:38	fosslinux	i don't see why it wouldn't
2018-11-29 07:03:44	fosslinux	the only issue may be speed
2018-11-29 07:03:53	fosslinux	is there one with dual hdd/ssd?
2018-11-29 07:06:46	deepend	speed is a non issue. yourtilde isn't slow by any means and I do not have SSDs in the server.. 
2018-11-29 07:06:55	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-29 07:07:25	~ben	yeah most stuff isn't i/o heavy
2018-11-29 07:07:31	fosslinux	saying that though, i migrated from hdd to ssd on my laptop and up to 5x faster startup etc... but i suppose thats not a problem for a ~
2018-11-29 07:07:32	~ben	and anything else will be cached in ram
2018-11-29 07:07:44	~ben	desktop hardware is different
2018-11-29 07:07:56	deepend	hell yourtildes configurtaion doesn't even prefer I/O speed.. since the drive is being mirrored between 4 drives at the moment..
2018-11-29 07:08:16	fosslinux	uhhhh why
2018-11-29 07:08:25	fosslinux	4 seems a lot
2018-11-29 07:08:33	deepend	bad planning(default configuration)
2018-11-29 07:08:33	~ben	raid
2018-11-29 07:08:50	fosslinux	are you using raid deepend?
2018-11-29 07:09:12	deepend	yes. 
2018-11-29 07:09:25	fosslinux	what type?
2018-11-29 07:09:52	deepend	I may in the near future modify the hard drive configuration. RAID1
2018-11-29 07:10:27	deepend	OVH installation scripts automatically do a RAID 1 configuration on all servers by default.. I forgot to change it when I setup this server 
2018-11-29 07:10:30	fosslinux	raid 1 between four drives??????????
2018-11-29 07:10:37	~ben	lol
2018-11-29 07:10:40	~ben	yes why not
2018-11-29 07:10:42	fosslinux	tbh never heard of such a thing 
2018-11-29 07:10:48	fosslinux	lol
2018-11-29 07:10:57	fosslinux	i see why you might
2018-11-29 07:11:05	~ben	you can raid1 between as many drives as you like
2018-11-29 07:11:14	deepend	I'd almost rather raid 5 or something like that.. hell i think raid0 would be fun :P 
2018-11-29 07:11:44	fosslinux	raid 6 would be best here i think
2018-11-29 07:11:53	deepend	raid1 is pointless.. usually when hardware fails in raid 1 it ends up corrupting the whole pile of mirrored drives.. so it really means nothing
2018-11-29 07:11:56	fosslinux	raid 0 .... hmmmmm
2018-11-29 07:12:38	fosslinux	deepend: "usually when hardware fails in raid 1 it ends up corrupting the whole pile of mirrored drives" huh? i don't think so
2018-11-29 07:12:39	deepend	raid 0 would sure improve the performance
2018-11-29 07:12:58	fosslinux	raid 10
2018-11-29 07:13:13	fosslinux	brb
2018-11-29 07:13:24	deepend	unless the drive fails completely.. like literally stops reading/writing all at once.. which isnt the more common failure.. your asking for trouble with a raid 1
2018-11-29 07:14:00	deepend	but more often it ends up being a cache failure .. which would cause corruption.
2018-11-29 07:14:53	deepend	I have 6 different drives here. all enterprise SATA drives.. all with cache issues.  
2018-11-29 07:16:52	fosslinux	cache failure?
2018-11-29 07:17:01	deepend	yes
2018-11-29 07:17:07	deepend	the drive cache failed
2018-11-29 07:17:18	fosslinux	i know what you mean
2018-11-29 07:17:22	fosslinux	the cache for raid?
2018-11-29 07:17:26	fosslinux	or the cache for the drive?
2018-11-29 07:17:36	~ben	sounds like drive cache
2018-11-29 07:17:38	deepend	the cache built on the drive itself
2018-11-29 07:17:59	fosslinux	right
2018-11-29 07:18:08	fosslinux	that would cause corruption

2018-11-29 07:19:27	deepend	cache issues account for 100% of all the failures I've seen in many years.  Ive had 0 head failures
2018-11-29 07:19:27	fosslinux	if i remember correctly however, you can mirror the drive cache

2018-11-29 07:21:34	deepend	probably due to heat tho.. since the systems i've been dealing with the company wont spend the money to even cool or even put active venting in the server room.. so they run in an oven.. :S  so they just go thru drives like they are free LOL   
2018-11-29 07:21:57	~ben	ouch
2018-11-29 07:22:14	deepend	and I laugh everytime I have to replace drives lol
2018-11-29 07:22:43	fosslinux	lol

2018-11-29 17:18:12	tildebeast	room to breath on a server like that though
2018-11-29 17:18:13	-->	stompy (peachfuzz@ip68-13-254-74.ok.ok.cox.net) has joined #team
2018-11-29 17:18:21	~ben	the major motivator was the lack of storage space on the current box
2018-11-29 17:18:29	tildebeast	how much is left here then?
2018-11-29 17:18:38	~ben	we were down to 25gb
2018-11-29 17:18:44	~ben	80 ish now
2018-11-29 17:18:53	~ben	but it has two 250gb ssds
2018-11-29 17:18:53	tildebeast	a mere bagatelle :)
2018-11-29 17:18:59	~ben	in raid 1
2018-11-29 17:19:10	tildebeast	is that actual bare metal then?
2018-11-29 17:19:17	~ben	software raid
2018-11-29 17:19:25	~ben	yeah, the current box is a dedi
2018-11-29 17:19:41	tildebeast	yup. i mistrust hardware raid as you're forever reliant on equivalent replacement parts
2018-11-29 17:19:48	~ben	and i didn't configure it properly when i ordered it
2018-11-29 17:19:53	tildebeast	whoops
2018-11-29 17:19:54	~ben	i don't really want raid 1 lol
2018-11-29 17:19:57	tildebeast	heh
2018-11-29 17:20:11	tildebeast	not so important if you run regular backups. you DO run regular backups, right? :D
2018-11-29 17:20:20	~ben	the preinstalled images automatically set up raid 1 for some reason
2018-11-29 17:20:22	~ben	yeah, hourly
2018-11-29 17:20:25	tildebeast	cool
2018-11-29 17:20:29	tildebeast	doing better than me then
2018-11-29 17:20:50	~ben	tarsnap++
2018-11-29 17:20:55	tildebeast	i have a mental cron job that backs up parts of my working data every n weeks :/
2018-11-29 17:21:00	tildebeast	or so
2018-11-29 17:21:02	~ben	lmao
2018-11-29 17:21:38	tildebeast	really need to get into borg or whatever, at least as far as my nas. from there maybe tarsnap or backblaze for the actual day-job stuff.
2018-11-29 17:21:57	~ben	tarsnap is crazy good a dedupe and compress
2018-11-29 17:22:31	tildebeast	currently 1 windows laptop, 2 linux laptops, various PIs, 1 freebsd server and 1 devuan nas machine here. running out of space above and below the desk :)
2018-11-29 17:22:39	tildebeast	and far too little of it is properly backed up
2018-11-29 17:22:44	~ben	lol srsly
2018-11-29 17:22:55	~ben	most of the stuff on my work machines are in git repos
2018-11-29 17:23:22	~ben	so i could lose one and not notice too much
2018-11-29 17:23:28	tildebeast	that's good if you're not working in honking great datasets per task. each ship log job runs from 3-10gb *input* data :/
2018-11-29 17:23:50	~ben	plus syncthing of other stuff on all my devices for access and redundancy
2018-11-29 17:23:58	~ben	lol no i'm not
2018-11-29 17:24:07	tildebeast	plus all the historical archives of my graphic design work -- catalogues, zillions of large photoshop files, 3d models, renders... :(
2018-11-29 17:24:18	~ben	oh god
2018-11-29 17:24:24	~ben	yeah i mostly work with plaintext
2018-11-29 17:25:25	tildebeast	i'm basically retiring from the graphic design side as it kills my eyes these days. so hopefully that lot can just be dumped in a coldstore somewhere. as for the rest i might just say "i'll keep it for up to 1 year. want it any longer, dear client, and you can pay for the storage."
2018-11-29 17:25:55	~ben	that's a totally reasonable policy
2018-11-29 17:26:11	tildebeast	would much rather work entirely with plaintext these days. much nicer. all my stories fit it in one tiny private git repo, five seconds tops to sync :)
2018-11-29 17:26:13	~ben	store it yourself! :P
2018-11-29 17:26:17	tildebeast	yup
2018-11-29 17:26:31	~ben	plaintext is incredibly efficient to store :D
2018-11-29 17:26:37	biglysmalls	ocould i bother someone for an invite to tilde.news for biglysmalls@tilde.team?
2018-11-29 17:26:39	tildebeast	very true
2018-11-29 17:26:44	~ben	sure thing biglysmalls 
2018-11-29 17:26:48	biglysmalls	thanks ben!
2018-11-29 17:27:07	~ben	sent
2018-11-29 17:27:45	tildebeast	have to vanish in a sec -- off to buy a 2nd-hand mechanical keyboard for the linux laptop. 
2018-11-29 17:28:07	~ben	ooo nice
2018-11-29 17:28:12	~ben	blue switches?
2018-11-29 17:29:12	tildebeast	dunno. cherry mx but i don't mind which as long as it's better than a laptop keyboard :) have a ducky zero with browns on my windows machine and it puts even the old dell laptops to shame
2018-11-29 17:29:29	tildebeast	something deafeningly clicky would be a bonus :D
2018-11-29 17:29:47	tildebeast	do you use one?
2018-11-29 17:30:43	~ben	i have a board with blues at work
2018-11-29 17:30:48	~ben	just to be extra obnoxious
2018-11-29 17:30:52	~ben	and reds at home
2018-11-29 17:32:17	jan6|	have a mic next to the keyboard, feeding into some speakers to make it even worse for others...

2018-11-29 19:36:10	fosslinux	oooof
2018-11-29 19:36:16	fosslinux	thats damn expensive

2018-11-29 19:37:10	fosslinux	now lets just bruteforce xyz :P
2018-11-29 19:37:11	~ben	and 12 cores 
2018-11-29 19:37:15	~ben	and 12tb disk

2018-11-29 19:40:21	aewens	ben: 128GB of RAM is not true power. Having 4 CPUs each with 20 cores running on 1.5TB is true power.
2018-11-29 19:40:39	~ben	/feels/ like true power

2018-11-29 19:41:36	aewens	fosslinux: I work at a company that sells super computers, so I have that a few feet from the desk I'm at right now.
2018-11-29 19:41:58	fosslinux	my dad has a machine at his work

2018-11-29 19:42:49	fosslinux	boy would i love to get my hands on one of those computers but $$$
2018-11-29 19:42:54	~ben	probly a good call

2018-11-29 19:57:45	fosslinux	ah
2018-11-29 19:57:53	~ben	did you find out what kind of switches it has?
2018-11-29 19:58:26	tildebeast	paid about a quarter of retail. doubt they've even used it more than a couple of times as it's nearly spotless
2018-11-29 19:58:30	tildebeast	basic mx reds
2018-11-29 19:58:41	tildebeast	but still makes a satisfying noise :)

2018-11-29 20:00:23	fosslinux	ie what to do with it
2018-11-29 20:00:38	tildebeast	at least 75% needs to be allocated to gopher-based services of course ;)
2018-11-29 20:00:42	fosslinux	lol
2018-11-29 20:00:52	fosslinux	as if that is possible with the lightweightness of gopher
2018-11-29 20:01:03	tildebeast	good point :)
2018-11-29 20:01:11	fosslinux	running 1000 gophernicus servers
2018-11-29 20:01:15	fosslinux	:P
2018-11-29 20:01:23	fosslinux	and one apache server to eat up the rest :PPP

2018-11-29 20:04:58	~ben	hetzner's premade images default to raid 1
2018-11-29 20:05:08	~ben	if you boot to rescue mode you can customize that setup

2018-11-29 20:05:26	~ben	heh i just helped tomasino get cosmic.voyage's mailserver up laste night
2018-11-29 20:05:32	tildebeast	i guess raid1 makes sense with 2 identical drives
2018-11-29 20:05:38	~ben	yeah but we need the space
2018-11-29 20:05:43	~ben	plus i already do backups

2018-11-29 20:09:33	~ben	heh it really just depends on whether the client looks at autoconfig.domain/autoconfig.xml

2018-11-29 20:58:18	ahriman	thanks
2018-11-29 20:59:13	tildebeast	i'll look into that then
2018-11-29 21:00:38	tildebeast	oh, i see. an A record for the subdomain and an MX record pointing at that...
2018-11-29 21:00:58	~ben	mx can point anywhere that resolves to the right machine
2018-11-29 21:02:31	tildebeast	i saw something about rDNS too so will have to read up on that
2018-11-29 21:02:59	~ben	oh yeah rDNS is rather important too
2018-11-29 21:03:11	~ben	spf, dmarc, and dkim too
2018-11-29 21:04:00	tildebeast	yikes
2018-11-29 21:08:02	~ben	spf and dmarc are simple txt records 
2018-11-29 21:08:14	~ben	dkim requires a milter like opendkim
2018-11-29 21:08:34	~ben	probably want dovecot sieve and spamd or spamassassin too

2018-11-30 14:09:34	tildebeast	PHP's sole claim to popularity is that it's easy to get started with. By the same token if poop came in lego-shaped bricks some folk would appreciate its ease of assembly.

2018-11-30 14:30:28	tildebeast	hum. if i want to build a simple nav menu with my static site generator rather than just hard-coding one, i'll need to parse metadata before each markdown file. no problem, there are semi-standard ways of including metadata preambles to markdown and some python modules that make it easy to parse. but...
2018-11-30 14:32:15	tildebeast	... should i keep memory use down by having an intermediate 'scan files first and build the nav menu file for inclusion later', or do the whole shebang (read markdown files, prepend header and nav menu, add html from markdown, append footer) in one single pass? The latter might use a ton of memory on a larger site.
2018-11-30 14:33:02	tildebeast	i don't really want to run two passes on the input files and generate intermediate files, but it's that or potentially use lots of memory.
2018-11-30 14:34:14	<--	stompy (peachfuzz@ip68-13-254-74.ok.ok.cox.net) has quit (Connection closed)
2018-11-30 14:45:25	jan6	first is better of course
2018-11-30 14:49:41	@khuxkm|lounge	scan in all of the files, parse metadata, gen nav menu, then (without passing over it again) use the input in-memory to gen the whole file
2018-11-30 15:25:29	tildebeast	khuxkm|lounge: that would be my preference. trouble is if you're doing that for, say, a few hundred markdown files then the memory usage climbs steeply. cos the menu needs to be built across the site as a whole.
2018-11-30 15:25:52	tildebeast	was hoping to build it so that it could run unobtrusively on something like a pi zero
2018-11-30 15:27:40	tildebeast	maybe the thing to do is try a very big site on my pi zero and see what it can handle :)
2018-11-30 15:30:27	ubergeek	^^^
2018-11-30 15:30:45	ubergeek	You might be surprised at how well it handles the task, especially if it's not time-sensitive.
2018-11-30 15:31:20	ubergeek	I offload procs like that in batch to a Pi A, and sometimes the jobs take a few hours to run, but I don't care, as long as they do.
2018-11-30 15:32:34	tildebeast	ubergeek: true. doesn't matter if it takes a while.
2018-11-30 15:33:02	~ben	fosslinux: possibley
2018-11-30 15:33:07	tildebeast	if it's, say, 20-30 pages then the build time will still be just a few seconds
2018-11-30 15:33:20	~ben	php isn't that bad
2018-11-30 15:34:02	~ben	oh i'm thinking that i could just compare the file to /etc/skel/public_html/indexphp
2018-11-30 15:34:55	tildebeast	just a diff?
2018-11-30 15:37:50	tildebeast	also re-discovered yesterday that firefox defaults to adjusting image colours according to profiles, so there's no guarantee that a simple png will actually be the same colour as a solid html background colour, even if you set it that way in your image editor...
2018-11-30 15:37:52	~ben	sha1_file
2018-11-30 15:38:00	tildebeast	that'd work too :)
2018-11-30 15:38:10	giteabot	[team/site] Ben Harris pushed dafbad5 to master. (skip default pages; https://tildegit.org/team/site/commit/dafbad5)
2018-11-30 15:40:37	tildebeast	'cmp --silent' is also good. doesn't need to generate a checksum, just stops at the first different byte between the two files...
2018-11-30 15:40:44	tildebeast	might be slightly quicker?
2018-11-30 15:40:57	jan6	^if you do (ba)sh
2018-11-30 15:41:27	tildebeast	what shell is this running in?
2018-11-30 15:41:36	jan6	crc is also good for just quick and dirty compare
2018-11-30 15:42:07	jan6	crc is VERY quick, but not "secure", so it's perfect to compare "has it changed" but not good for a secure checksum

2018-11-30 15:43:31	tildebeast	all of these methods would fail if there's an invisible change such as an extra space between html tags. how about rendering each ~/index.html then comparing the resulting images to a reference render of the default page? :D

2018-11-30 20:28:44	~ben	that patch is live btw
2018-11-30 20:28:48	~ben	already done it
2018-11-30 20:28:49	fosslinux	oh cool
2018-11-30 20:29:23	~ben	i just did sha1_file(defaultindex) == sha1_file(user)
2018-11-30 20:31:57	fosslinux	https://tilde.team/~sl2c/
2018-11-30 20:32:03	fosslinux	is still on there and has the default page
2018-11-30 20:36:38	jan6	why sha1 tho?
2018-11-30 20:38:26	aewens	Yeah, we are in the sha256 world now, sha1 is dead https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html
2018-11-30 20:40:42	aewens	Also see this: https://valerieaurora.org/hash.html
2018-11-30 20:43:11	fosslinux	aewens: do you do security work?
2018-11-30 20:44:20	aewens	I wrote a multi-page manifesto on Internet security and do hobbyist infosec stuff, does that count?
2018-11-30 20:45:25	fosslinux	yes
2018-11-30 20:45:38	aewens	Then yes, I do security work.
2018-11-30 20:45:59	fosslinux	i want to get into infosec when i'm older, (im in high school now (australia)), what sort of stuff should i be focusing on?
2018-11-30 20:48:11	aewens	I got started by working on ciphers and figuring out how encryption / decryption works (and finding the difference between symmetric and asymmetric). Then there's taking into account the human factor with phishing.
2018-11-30 20:49:13	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-30 20:49:13	aewens	If you want some material, go through the infosec videos from Art of the Problem https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtOfTheProblem
2018-11-30 20:49:25	fosslinux	thanks :D
2018-11-30 20:49:56	fosslinux	basically what i've figured out so far is that there is two main parts
2018-11-30 20:50:09	aewens	And for phishing, a fun way to steal your friend's Facebook logins using a fake login page.
2018-11-30 20:50:13	fosslinux	1. the computer side
2018-11-30 20:50:15	fosslinux	2. human side
2018-11-30 20:50:43	aewens	It's important to understand the computer side, but for a bulk of pentesting you can usually use the human side alone.
2018-11-30 20:51:06	fosslinux	"for a bulk of pentesting you can usually use the human side alone." ?
2018-11-30 20:51:30	aewens	Oh, another *really* useful tool is net/port scanning. If you can find the routers / switches for places, a lot of people never change the default username/password on those.
2018-11-30 20:51:56	aewens	Oh, pentesting is short for penetration testing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test
2018-11-30 20:51:59	fosslinux	ik
2018-11-30 20:52:02	fosslinux	i know
2018-11-30 20:52:31	fosslinux	but what does that mean? for a bulk of penteration testing you can usually use the human side alone? (i know what penteration testing is)
2018-11-30 20:52:40	fosslinux	20:51:30            aewens | Oh, another *really* useful tool is net/port scanning.
2018-11-30 20:52:48	fosslinux	thats how i brought ~team down :PPPP
2018-11-30 20:53:05	aewens	For instance, I didn't need to find a way to trick a bank's security badge lock to get into their server room. I just asked someone nearby to let me in because I was there to do repairs and showed her a business card.
2018-11-30 20:53:23	fosslinux	ok right
2018-11-30 20:53:25	fosslinux	i see
2018-11-30 20:53:28	aewens	fosslinux: Yeah, that's why hetzner doesn't want you netscanning ;)
2018-11-30 20:53:57	fosslinux	yep
2018-11-30 20:55:27	aewens	Some other things to look into is "password hashing" "salting" "initialization vectors" "how aes works" "which mode in aes to use" "how rsa works" "how diffie hellman works" "how ecdsa works" "rsa vs ecdsa" "authenticate vs authenticity" "what HMAC is"
2018-11-30 20:55:50	fosslinux	hmmm ecryption everywhere
2018-11-30 20:56:46	fosslinux	:D
2018-11-30 20:57:58	aewens	There's also "sql injection" "cross site scripting (XSS)" "session hijacking" "timed attacks" "slow loris" and stuff like that for attacking client / server implementations
2018-11-30 20:58:10	fosslinux	"cross site scripting (XSS)"
2018-11-30 20:58:21	fosslinux	Ive been trying to learn that one
2018-11-30 20:58:33	fosslinux	i completed the first few of google's xss challanges
2018-11-30 20:58:38	jan6	"How to randomize your mac address" "what is a VPN" "Social Engineering 101"
2018-11-30 20:58:59	fosslinux	 "How to randomize your mac address" "what is a VPN" know those two
2018-11-30 20:59:16	fosslinux	"what is a VPN" i think most people here would know that :D
2018-11-30 20:59:23	aewens	A simple example of XSS is if a website does not sanitize user data, you leave a comment on a blog using "<script>alert('lol');</script>" and you have now put your own JS onto the site.
2018-11-30 20:59:43	jan6	from what computerphile showed, Slow Loris is a hilariously simple exploit, even though meant for slow networks and stuff
2018-11-30 20:59:56	jan6	aewens: that's not ACTUAL XSS
2018-11-30 21:00:03	jan6	it's not XROSS site
2018-11-30 21:00:39	fosslinux	whats actual xss then jan6, and what's that?
2018-11-30 21:00:40	aewens	I more meant that XSS is exploited there to do XROSS. The point is they didn't sanitize their data and I can use that to perform XSS.
2018-11-30 21:01:08	jan6	who knows, maybe the site allows alert tags, but filters out anything more useful, just to give false hope?
2018-11-30 21:01:22	aewens	pfff
2018-11-30 21:01:24	fosslinux	what's xross
2018-11-30 21:01:27	jan6	but kay 
2018-11-30 21:02:12	jan6	cross site scripting = XSS => X(ross) S(ite) S(cripting), logically
2018-11-30 21:02:32	fosslinux	oh right ok
2018-11-30 21:02:52	jan6	it's weird naming, but "sounds cool"
2018-11-30 21:04:00	fosslinux	:P
2018-11-30 21:04:00	aewens	There's also CSRF, which is Cross Site Request Forgery.
2018-11-30 21:04:21	fosslinux	heard of that too
2018-11-30 21:04:36	aewens	jan6: They did XSS instead of CSS because CSS already existed, and used the "X" looks like a cross for the name.
2018-11-30 21:04:45	fosslinux	there is more protection against that these days though isn't there?
2018-11-30 21:04:52	fosslinux	its pretty easy to protect against csrf
2018-11-30 21:05:02	tomasino	it's probably the most common vulnerability i run across in security checks
2018-11-30 21:05:13	aewens	Sure, but many newbies don't do it if they aren't using something like django or rails.
2018-11-30 21:05:24	fosslinux	ok sure
2018-11-30 21:06:09	aewens	You'll also want to quickly adopt the philosophy to never ever trust data sent by the client.
2018-11-30 21:06:18	fosslinux	for sure
2018-11-30 21:06:58	aewens	Which is where the authentication over authenticity really plays in.
2018-11-30 21:07:55	aewens	You can store a cookie to keep a user logged in, but if you don't check the authenticity I can use that cookie to try and brute force my way into being another user. So you need authenticity to prove the cookie was provided by the server and not changed afterwards.
2018-11-30 21:08:46	jan6	always make sure the data falls within your parameters, if you expect plaintext, then display it plaintext, not html, there are <pre> and such tags for a reason
2018-11-30 21:09:25	jan6	css to make them look normal and boom
2018-11-30 21:12:09	aewens	Also, you'll want to make sure error messages from the server never leak important information. If I try to login with an email and password and you tell me the password is wrong, I know know that email is a part of your service without needing to know their password or trying to search for their account.
2018-11-30 21:13:08	aewens	That's why sites go with "Your email/password do not match our records" so you only know that the pair are wrong.
2018-11-30 21:13:38	fosslinux	i have seen services with that exact problem
2018-11-30 21:15:00	aewens	Also, if you ever reset your password on an account and they are able to send you what your password was in an email, you now know that website is storing your password (and everyone else's) in plaintext, so a data breach will leak all that information.
2018-11-30 21:16:12	fosslinux	offtopic, but announcement tilders, i have registered tildeteam.{tk,ml,ga,cf,gq} (all free domains) via freenom, i'll add these to the wiki page
2018-11-30 21:16:13	fosslinux	ben:
2018-11-30 21:16:40	fosslinux	aewens: right for sure
2018-11-30 21:16:48	~ben	don't add them unless you have mx set up proplerly
2018-11-30 21:17:33	fosslinux	mx?
2018-11-30 21:17:38	fosslinux	what do i need in the mx record?
2018-11-30 21:17:38	aewens	fosslinux: But yeah, that should all give you a place to start.
2018-11-30 21:17:43	fosslinux	thanks
2018-11-30 21:17:58	jan6	I HATE how it doesn't tell me if my mail is right in the login boxes, even though, sure, security
2018-11-30 21:18:16	aewens	No problem! Also, if you are not already, use a password manager and make sure your email does not share the password of literally any one of your other accounts.
2018-11-30 21:18:31	jan6	how would *I* know which one of the 5 mails I used for THIS site? or can I only login by username? and which one?
2018-11-30 21:18:44	jan6	nay, Immah insecure nobody
2018-11-30 21:18:51	fosslinux	yes i do that aewens
2018-11-30 21:18:57	jan6	I won't change that until it's too late
2018-11-30 21:19:08	aewens	jan6: Use an account manager to handle that?
2018-11-30 21:19:29	jan6	nay
2018-11-30 21:19:38	aewens	You do you
2018-11-30 21:19:47	jan6	I won't have anyone else's software know ALL of my accounts, nay way!
2018-11-30 21:20:32	fosslinux	jan6: use an open source offline password manager
2018-11-30 21:20:33	jan6	it's so much more secure, UNTIL they figure out it's pass/backdoor/CIA orders them to give acces to my account
2018-11-30 21:20:36	fosslinux	i use padlock
2018-11-30 21:20:59	aewens	jan6: Bitwarden is open source and you can run your own version of it.
2018-11-30 21:21:53	aewens	There's also KeePassX for the super-duper paranoid that runs off a file on your computer that you encrypt that's connected to zero servers (also open source).
2018-11-30 21:22:54	jan6	I'd rather use my poor memory and use derivative passwords everywhere, much easier an nobody's bothered to target me yet
2018-11-30 21:23:17	fosslinux	ben: any other records i need to look out for
2018-11-30 21:23:19	jan6	after all, I don't have basically anything worth much
2018-11-30 21:24:26	jan6	fosslinux: you can just redirect them to ~team's main page otherwise, the point is that you can send mail to any listed domains, which requires MX domains, rest is usually just redirects afaik
2018-11-30 21:24:44	jan6	so you can mail jan6@tilde.ninja and it'd get delivered
2018-11-30 21:25:07	fosslinux	i know
2018-11-30 21:25:14	fosslinux	i'm setting up the MX records nwo
2018-11-30 21:25:54	sebboh-yt	jan6 I started using yapet after years of using your method.  Over time, my method of deriving per-site passwords became less uncommon..  And some of my passwords were disclosed via breaches.  After receiving one of those "I got your password send me bitcoin" emails with a real (but useless) site-specific password of mine, I figured it was time to go full random.  ...basically I feared that
2018-11-30 21:25:57	sebboh-yt	somebody could figure out my derivition algo if they were to see to many more of my real passwords..
2018-11-30 21:26:43	aewens	fosslinux: Oh, right, another infosec thing you should know. Always have a get away plan for the day you inevitably go rogue and need a new identity. Be sure to melt the hard drives and throw them into a lake on your way out.
2018-11-30 21:26:55	~ben	fosslinux: mail.tilde.team

2018-11-30 21:28:42	aewens	You can literally get the Administrator account on Windows 10 using just the install ISO, it's sad how easy it is xD
2018-11-30 21:28:52	jan6	heh
2018-11-30 21:28:53	fosslinux	even if you ahve bitlocker?

2018-11-30 21:29:45	jan6	installer has bitlocker support too, to be able to set it up and stuff, I bet, and it doesn't care about permissions since it's installer, not proper OS
2018-11-30 21:29:50	 *	fosslinux Shutting down *windy circle animation*
2018-11-30 21:30:12	jan6	*you have 5 unclosed programs, really shut down?*

2018-11-30 21:30:26	cdmnky	beach ball of death
2018-11-30 21:30:42	fosslinux	whats the point of even having bitlocker then if you can just get the admin account
2018-11-30 21:30:50	~ben	security theater
2018-11-30 21:31:02	fosslinux	?
2018-11-30 21:31:05	aewens	Oh boy, time to shutdown my computer before this storm tonight *Windows is now installing updates, please wait in indefinite amount of time*
2018-11-30 21:31:06	jan6	windows and security in one sentence? HAH
2018-11-30 21:31:31	fosslinux	i wish i could use linux at school
2018-11-30 21:31:33	aewens	fosslinux: Security theater, it means so you can feel safe without being safe.
2018-11-30 21:31:35	fosslinux	but NOOOOOOOOO
2018-11-30 21:31:38	jan6	16:31:31         fosslinux | i wish i could use linux at school
2018-11-30 21:31:44	jan6	why can't you, in a VM at least?
2018-11-30 21:31:49	fosslinux	i do
2018-11-30 21:31:51	fosslinux	but thats in windows
2018-11-30 21:31:55	fosslinux	so whats the point
2018-11-30 21:32:00	aewens	Well, you can. Use a live version of Linux on a USB and boot from that.
2018-11-30 21:32:06	jan6	oh, is the bios locked?
2018-11-30 21:32:13	jan6	^cause yeah
2018-11-30 21:32:14	fosslinux	no no
2018-11-30 21:32:18	aewens	Pfff, schools don't lock the BIOS
2018-11-30 21:32:19	fosslinux	we bring our own computers
2018-11-30 21:32:23	fosslinux	21:32:18            aewens | Pfff, schools don't lock the BIOS
2018-11-30 21:32:30	fosslinux	yes they do on school computers
2018-11-30 21:32:31	~ben	then why tf are you using windows
2018-11-30 21:32:36	fosslinux	21:32:31              ~ben | then why tf are you using windows
2018-11-30 21:32:37	jan6	then why not run WINDOWS in a vm in your linux install?!
2018-11-30 21:32:47	jan6	srsly
2018-11-30 21:32:49	fosslinux	1. school wifi dosen't work on linux tf do i know why
2018-11-30 21:32:49	~ben	that's a far better solution ^
2018-11-30 21:32:58	~ben	figure it out
2018-11-30 21:33:00	~ben	rtfm
2018-11-30 21:33:02	aewens	fosslinux: What brand are the computers? There are public backdoors to BIOS locks for most vendors.
2018-11-30 21:33:02	~ben	lol
2018-11-30 21:33:06	jan6	pass wifi device to the VM, or figure out, yeah
2018-11-30 21:33:07	fosslinux	i have 
2018-11-30 21:33:16	jan6	ask some forums and stuff
2018-11-30 21:33:18	fosslinux	ben i've spent HOURS trying to figure it out
2018-11-30 21:33:35	fosslinux	aewens: lenovo thinkpads low end
2018-11-30 21:33:40	aewens	fosslinux: Is it one of those Wifi things where you give it and user/password to sign into it?
2018-11-30 21:33:44	fosslinux	yes
2018-11-30 21:34:02	jan6	ask everywhere you can, including <insert stackoverflow board that deals with hardware-ish things or such>
2018-11-30 21:34:03	fosslinux	PEAP-2 MSCHAPV2 WPA-2 enteprise
2018-11-30 21:34:21	fosslinux	you know what
2018-11-30 21:34:33	fosslinux	this school holidays coming up, i'm going to reinstall with linux

2018-11-30 21:35:23	fosslinux	plus i need to encrypt everything in my educationgoogle drive
2018-11-30 21:35:33	fosslinux	which wasn't done but i thought it was
2018-11-30 21:35:40	jan6	at worst, you can use a USB wifi adapter and pass that to the VM, cause I can guarantee you can pass usb to the VM
2018-11-30 21:35:48	fosslinux	sure
2018-11-30 21:36:21	jan6	you can even boot for a physical usb device in a VM which is handy, and I didn't know worked
2018-11-30 21:36:27	fosslinux	sutff that version 2
2018-11-30 21:36:34	fosslinux	i'll bringmy portable linux to school

2018-11-30 21:36:55	fosslinux	why didn't i think of that before
2018-11-30 21:37:39	aewens	Ta-dah!
2018-11-30 21:38:13	 *	fosslinux goes back to bed to be able to think

2018-11-30 21:40:38	fosslinux	https://www.cocosenor.com/articles/computer/3-ways-to-unlock-bios-password-on-lenovo-thinkpad-laptop.html
2018-11-30 21:41:15	cdmnky	fosslinux there's instructions on how to get past bios passwords in the service manuals themselves that you can get off their website
2018-11-30 21:41:32	fosslinux	lmao

2018-11-30 21:43:58	jan6	how to reset bios, it's simple
2018-11-30 21:44:17	jan6	open up the computer and remoce mos battery and power source
2018-11-30 21:44:28	jan6	then touch together those contacts and boom
2018-11-30 21:44:40	jan6	*remove cmos
2018-11-30 21:44:46	aewens	Yep, paper clip and screw driver are your hacking tools
2018-11-30 21:45:24	jan6	also, beware he who wield screwdriver, it's a mighty tool!
2018-11-30 21:45:41	aewens	Then you realize how cheap lock picks are, that your previous land lord never switches out the locks and it costs $2 to copy a key.
2018-11-30 21:45:57	jan6	heh
2018-11-30 21:46:03	aewens	Nothing can stop you now
2018-11-30 21:46:23	jan6	protip, replace your lock with a tubular one, nobody will have any idea how to upen it, but you ;P
2018-11-30 21:46:45	aewens	No joke though, I have a keychain of all the keys to the previous places I lived.
2018-11-30 21:46:50	jan6	and if you lose the key you can just use a pen to force it open ;P
2018-11-30 21:47:24	aewens	Nah, I keep backup keys hidden on the property inside locked boxes
2018-11-30 21:47:39	jan6	to which you need the key inside of it
2018-11-30 21:48:00	aewens	Yeah, but they're combination locked
2018-11-30 21:48:04	jan6	and they certainly have rocks hot glued to the top
2018-11-30 21:48:29	aewens	Who is gluing rocks to keys? Not me.
2018-11-30 21:54:19	fosslinux	jan6: id get in HUGE trouble if i was caught doing that
2018-11-30 21:57:03	aewens	fosslinux: Rule #1: Don't get caught doing that
2018-11-30 21:57:31	fosslinux	thats why i'd prefer a backdoor password which i now know exists
2018-11-30 21:57:57	aewens	You can start with this https://bios-pw.org/
2018-11-30 21:58:07	fosslinux	ik
2018-11-30 21:58:10	fosslinux	i found that
2018-11-30 21:59:03	aewens	When I did repair work I used that, the pop CMOS + jumper thing, then replacing the motherboard as a last resort.
2018-11-30 21:59:22	aewens	I think I only ever had to replace the motherboard once.
2018-11-30 23:52:48	sebboh-yt	I repaired a motherboard once.
2018-11-30 23:57:18	fosslinux	you repaired a motherboard?
2018-11-30 23:57:23	fosslinux	how did that go?

2018-12-01 21:19:06	jan6	the "haxor bootstrap" part stays the same, along with almost all of the description

2018-12-01 21:19:31	~ben	to what?
2018-12-01 21:19:41	~ben	all i added was the link to swap themes

2018-12-01 21:21:40	~ben	since she created teh dracula theme
2018-12-01 21:24:21	jan6	is it true dracula then, though? or "facula"
2018-12-01 21:26:06	~ben	?
2018-12-01 21:28:55	jan6	kinda like how the "solarized" theme has specific requirements to be filled, is it "true dracula" or "fake dracula => facula"?
2018-12-01 21:29:05	jan6	doesn't matter really
2018-12-01 21:29:45	~ben	i think the original theme is called darcula

2018-12-04 18:54:43	ahriman	i like using ttm.sh for mail rather than tilde.team, it's more compact and it's a pretty domain
2018-12-04 18:55:31	jan6	^sure
2018-12-04 18:55:50	jan6	same reason why pm.me exists for protonmail for example

2018-12-04 20:46:43	~ben	tildegit.org not good enough? :P
2018-12-04 20:47:01	jan6	I just curled on ~team and it looks like
2018-12-04 20:47:03	jan6	                                © Gitea Version: 1.5.0 Page: <strong>24ms</strong> Template: <strong>8ms</strong>
2018-12-04 20:47:18	~ben	?
2018-12-04 20:47:50	~ben	oh the chill-tilde one?
2018-12-04 20:47:53	~ben	that's out of date
2018-12-04 20:47:58	~ben	tildegit.org is up to 1.6
2018-12-04 20:48:02	jan6	btw, this is interesting given the claim (s)he said to be installing 1.6.0
2018-12-04 20:48:18	~ben	lies!
2018-12-04 20:48:22	jan6	14:27:27             murii | what version?
2018-12-04 20:48:24	jan6	14:27:31             murii | I have 1.6.0
2018-12-04 20:48:44	jan6	the cake is a lieeeEEEE!
2018-12-04 21:01:48	hyperboredoubt	I've yet to play Portal.
2018-12-04 21:06:54	jan6	don't play it
2018-12-04 21:06:59	jan6	play portal 2 instead
2018-12-04 21:09:49	hyperboredoubt	That could be good.
2018-12-04 21:10:16	jan6	now you're thinking with portals!
2018-12-04 21:27:58	murii	I just played portal 2
2018-12-04 21:28:40	murii	I went with 1.6.0 first
2018-12-04 21:28:41	jan6	and?
2018-12-04 21:28:49	jan6	is the cake a lie?
2018-12-04 21:28:58	murii	some MySQL crap and I thought on switching to 1.5.0 
2018-12-04 21:29:02	murii	same result
2018-12-04 21:29:08	murii	so I switched to sqlite3
2018-12-04 21:29:10	murii	that works
2018-12-04 21:29:27	jan6	sqlite is the best
2018-12-04 21:29:57	~ben	sqlite is pretty great tbh
2018-12-04 21:30:02	murii	today I made my own simple tilde
2018-12-04 21:30:03	jan6	if possible, and the thing's not gonna be much used, always go for sqlite imo
2018-12-04 21:30:05	murii	using a RPI 3 B+
2018-12-04 21:30:08	~ben	you should go back to 1.6
2018-12-04 21:30:14	murii	I will now
2018-12-04 21:33:51	murii	done
2018-12-04 21:34:03	murii	what should I use for mails?
2018-12-04 21:34:16	murii	a mailing system
2018-12-04 21:34:41	snurryboy	I just bought a pi 3 b cause sale on arrow
2018-12-04 21:34:50	snurryboy	35$aud shipped free fedex
2018-12-04 21:34:53	snurryboy	Well 34
2018-12-04 21:34:55	murii	b +?
2018-12-04 21:35:03	snurryboy	Nah
2018-12-04 21:35:11	snurryboy	That was like 13$ extra
2018-12-04 21:35:41	murii	if anyone wants to join let me a pm
2018-12-04 21:35:41	snurryboy	I wouldn’t really notice the upgrade that much especially since I haven’t had one befor
2018-12-04 21:35:51	murii	better cpu and heat disparser
2018-12-04 21:36:01	snurryboy	Regular 3 b will be enough for me
2018-12-04 21:36:06	murii	sure
2018-12-04 21:36:08	~ben	murii: postfix
2018-12-04 21:36:19	murii	oh,good,I have that installed

2018-12-04 21:37:21	~ben	if you need help, holler
2018-12-04 21:37:29	murii	ty
2018-12-04 21:37:52	murii	I need help regarding the terminal, I want to have buffers like team has
2018-12-04 21:38:06	~ben	just got tómasino set up with postfix on cosmic.voyage the other day
2018-12-04 21:38:13	~ben	murii: apt install byobu
2018-12-04 21:38:35	murii	that's a terminal emulator?
2018-12-04 21:38:40	~ben	?
2018-12-04 21:38:46	murii	byobu
2018-12-04 21:38:50	~ben	it's a wrapper for tmux/screen
2018-12-04 21:38:57	murii	oh
2018-12-04 21:38:58	~ben	it's what ~team launches by default 
2018-12-04 21:39:08	~ben	terminal emulator is what you use in x11
2018-12-04 21:39:11	~ben	or wayland
2018-12-04 21:39:19	~ben	and since it's just a shell, there's no terminal emulator
2018-12-04 21:39:27	murii	what about the fancy status on the bottom of the screen?
2018-12-04 21:39:50	~ben	that's byobu's default
2018-12-04 21:39:51	murii	grep and awk of some kind?
2018-12-04 21:39:53	murii	oh
2018-12-04 21:40:01	murii	cool
2018-12-04 21:40:06	~ben	yeah byobu is good shit
2018-12-04 21:40:16	murii	seems like
2018-12-04 21:40:22	murii	I'll add it first thing in the morning
2018-12-04 21:40:39	~ben	yup
2018-12-04 21:40:49	murii	any other tips?
2018-12-04 21:40:52	~ben	um
2018-12-04 21:40:53	murii	like how to manage users?
2018-12-04 21:41:09	murii	that being my and myself as of now
2018-12-04 21:41:17	~ben	https://tildegit.org/team/makeuser/src/branch/bash-edition
2018-12-04 21:41:18	murii	you got some scripts for setting a user?
2018-12-04 21:41:19	~ben	have a look
2018-12-04 21:41:34	murii	ok
2018-12-04 21:42:57	murii	nice,nice
2018-12-04 21:43:07	murii	was thinking at something similar as well
2018-12-04 21:44:56	~ben	the toot program is required too
2018-12-04 21:45:01	~ben	cat $(which toot) 
2018-12-04 21:45:04	~ben	here on ~team ^
2018-12-04 21:45:33	murii	for hosting pictures and text what do you suggest?
2018-12-04 21:45:38	murii	I need something lightweight
2018-12-04 21:46:47	~ben	nginx
2018-12-04 21:47:04	~ben	best all purpose webserver by far
2018-12-04 21:47:06	ahriman	nginx++; it's really lightweight and easy to configure
2018-12-04 21:47:16	~ben	apache is fine but it's probably a bit heavy for a pi
2018-12-04 21:47:26	murii	I run apache
2018-12-04 21:47:36	~ben	switch to nginx
2018-12-04 21:47:50	~ben	you'll save quite a bit on system resources and get a speed boost for static assets
2018-12-04 21:48:11	~ben	from some super simple test, nginx is 2 to 3 times faster for static assets
2018-12-04 21:48:15	murii	ok, I'll have a look at it
2018-12-04 21:48:20	murii	oh
2018-12-04 21:48:23	~ben	and about the same as apache for dynamic stuff like php
2018-12-04 21:50:32	snurryboy	I like byobu tabs but I hated it connecting to weechat and mail every time
2018-12-04 21:51:31	~ben	you can change that
2018-12-04 21:51:48	~ben	or just don't kill the whole session
2018-12-04 21:51:51	murii	where are incidents reported eg doing sudo
2018-12-04 21:51:56	~ben	mail to root
2018-12-04 21:52:13	murii	nice
2018-12-04 21:52:22	~ben	you'll want to set something up in /etc/aliases
2018-12-04 21:52:41	~ben	snurryboy: byobu is meant to be left running and you just detach from it 
2018-12-04 21:55:55	snurryboy	Yea I have it set up to stay detached atm
2018-12-04 21:56:18	snurryboy	But I coulda sworn even when I quit weechat next time I logged in it loaded it again
2018-12-04 22:01:42	murii	ben: rc.local from etc/ is good for booting scripts?
2018-12-04 22:02:08	~ben	snurryboy: that only happens if you kill the whole session and you start a new one
2018-12-04 22:02:12	~ben	murii: ?
2018-12-04 22:02:14	~ben	what distro??
2018-12-04 22:02:17	murii	debian
2018-12-04 22:02:29	~ben	what kind of scripts
2018-12-04 22:02:33	~ben	just use a systemd service
2018-12-04 22:02:37	murii	like starting gitea
2018-12-04 22:02:41	snurryboy	Yea but eventually I’m gonna logout for whatever reason
2018-12-04 22:03:01	snurryboy	It’d be nice to be able to set up a blank byobu by default
2018-12-04 22:03:10	~ben	murii: systemd service

2018-12-05 07:20:27	~ben	lol i just find it strange to hear people complain about stuff that isn't actually cold
2018-12-05 07:20:29	ahriman	fosslinux: ball swinging is bragging / posturing
2018-12-05 07:20:54	ahriman	it's cold when you're accustomed to southern summers

2018-12-05 07:21:10	fosslinux	another term i've never heard
2018-12-05 07:21:20	fosslinux	i took that the complete wrong way
2018-12-05 07:22:22	ahriman	1) it wasn't sexual, 2) don't be a homophobe, fosslinux
2018-12-05 07:22:47	fosslinux	im not
2018-12-05 07:24:01	~ben	slang is different everywhere i suppose
2018-12-05 07:24:27	fosslinux	at my school thats common talk lol

2018-12-05 07:25:14	fosslinux	did you know of the action ben?
2018-12-05 07:25:32	~ben	i mean there's different greetings you can use
2018-12-05 07:25:50	ahriman	oh i forgot, i grew up in an urban, big city where a lot of AAVE gets mixed in with more common slang
2018-12-05 07:26:10	fosslinux	oh right
2018-12-05 07:26:24	~ben	and i'm from a very non-diverse area
2018-12-05 07:26:31	~ben	we get finnish words instead lol
2018-12-05 07:26:38	~ben	like sisu
2018-12-05 07:26:41	ahriman	throw some finnish at me and im lost
2018-12-05 07:26:45	~ben	and Kantapää
2018-12-05 07:26:47	ahriman	yep im lost
2018-12-05 07:26:53	~ben	figured that one out thanks to SinaCutie 
2018-12-05 07:27:04	~ben	apparently it means the heel of a sock
2018-12-05 07:27:13	fosslinux	wat the heck
2018-12-05 07:27:17	~ben	but my whole family uses it to refer to the end piece of a loaf of bread
2018-12-05 07:27:19	fosslinux	when would you need that
2018-12-05 07:27:27	ahriman	weirdly specific words for $600, alex
2018-12-05 07:27:54	~ben	but we've always pronounced it slightly wrong; more like gundaba
2018-12-05 07:29:07	SinaCutie	It can also be used for the bread heel yeah
2018-12-05 07:29:43	~ben	heh
2018-12-05 07:29:54	~ben	fun to figure out a weird thing your family says
2018-12-05 07:30:01	SinaCutie	"gundaba" to me sounds more like southeastern Finland accent, mixed with generational corruption. xD
2018-12-05 07:30:07	SinaCutie	*Southwestern
2018-12-05 07:30:13	~ben	heh that's very possible!

2018-12-05 12:43:31	snurryboy	hey ben do you know how to install rtorrent+rutorrent with seperate users? i'm trying to look for a way to compile it myself in my directory but i'm not finding anything yet that doesn't need sudo. i've got a friend who's ratio is fucked on IPT and I wanna get it back into the positive for her. i don't actually need to seed a bunch of data the regular way; what I wanna do is just get a handful of tiny files like ebooks that have no leeches and keep them in
2018-12-05 12:43:32	snurryboy	 seed status. you get a set amount of bonus points per torrent per hour you're seeding them regardless of data transfer and I can have her trade them in for upload buffer.
2018-12-05 12:44:01	arne	i'll make a bot in rc
2018-12-05 12:44:06	arne	bcoz I'm cool
2018-12-05 12:44:13	snurryboy	i need a remote machine to do the seeding so they don't figure out its me doing it for her

2018-12-05 14:38:58	khuxkm|lounge	no torrenting on tilde.team
2018-12-05 14:39:24	khuxkm|lounge	if it's small files, use a t2.micro on AWS
2018-12-05 14:39:29	khuxkm|lounge	it's not too expensive
2018-12-05 14:42:01	jan6	just wondering, WHY no torrenting?
2018-12-05 14:43:43	arne	jan6 i am cool
2018-12-05 14:43:48	khuxkm|lounge	is bad
2018-12-05 14:44:00	khuxkm|lounge	not to mention someone could lie about why they were doing it
2018-12-05 14:48:59	jan6	why's it "bad"?
2018-12-05 14:49:55	jan6	as long as it's not uploading then it's fine imo, (well, possibly very little seeding)
2018-12-05 16:51:38	ubergeek	do you need full X11, or just x11-base?
2018-12-05 16:51:53	ubergeek	gah, strike the last
2018-12-05 16:52:00	ubergeek	pg dn is hard

2018-12-05 16:54:39	~ben	i mean i can install it if you need

2018-12-05 17:03:36	jan6	lol, run firefox on ~team, ssh forward ;P
2018-12-05 17:05:33	~ben	seems like an interesting idea
2018-12-05 17:05:49	jan6	I tried to run minecraft on my lxc

2018-12-05 17:09:14	jan6	sure, lol
2018-12-05 17:10:01	jan6	I do think there is kinda integrated graphics probably, cause I doubt mc will use cpu rendering even in a pinch
2018-12-05 17:11:25	~ben	there is
2018-12-05 17:11:28	~ben	it's an i7 
2018-12-05 17:11:39	~ben	so probably intel hd graphics 4000 or whatever
2018-12-05 17:14:22	anarchmellow	What does "wb" means ?
2018-12-05 17:14:49	~ben	welcome back
2018-12-05 17:16:55	ubergeek	Fwiw, if remote X sessions are desired, as a feature here, x2go is the way to go, rather than X forwarding alone
2018-12-05 17:17:27	ubergeek	Lag is really bad over the internet, because X is chatty as fsck

2018-12-05 17:45:27	~ben	to1.hashbang.sh is even closer for me

2018-12-05 17:52:28	ubergeek	I think it's the ping response tariff at play here.  10ms latency to cross the border

2018-12-05 18:00:32	~ben	i'm guessing sub 20 to ny1 for you
2018-12-05 18:11:23	ahriman	i get right at 30ms to to1 for hashbang
2018-12-05 18:12:32	ahriman	21-26ms to ny1, so they have really awesome routing wherever they are

2018-12-06 20:07:19	@cmccabe	anybody want to write a tutorial on "git basics for collaborating with other tilde users"? to be part of the same series as the command-line-basics tutorial.
2018-12-06 20:14:17	~ben	ayy cmccabe i've already got one started
2018-12-06 20:14:24	~ben	https://benharri.github.io/learngit
2018-12-06 20:14:29	~ben	needs some updating for tildes
2018-12-06 20:14:40	~ben	i'd love to get something like that started
2018-12-06 20:26:23	ubergeek	cmccabe: I was going to try and work on that this weekend, since I noted the deficit this week
2018-12-06 20:26:55	~ben	let's get a cryptpad doc up and work on it together?
2018-12-06 20:51:14	ubergeek	I'm up for that, as I have time
2018-12-06 20:52:17	~ben	i'm up for cannibalizing my existing docs as well
2018-12-06 21:05:00	ubergeek	I think that is gitea specific would be a good diea too
2018-12-06 21:05:45	jan6	good diet too
2018-12-06 21:07:44	~ben	hm?
2018-12-06 21:07:48	~ben	oh i mean steal the content
2018-12-06 21:07:58	ubergeek	gitea...
2018-12-06 21:08:07	~ben	it's on github
2018-12-06 21:10:28	ubergeek	No, I mean the "how to"s tailored to a gitea instance, since that is what we use here
2018-12-06 21:10:53	ubergeek	Some ppl don't like cli git.
2018-12-06 21:16:17	jan6	porcelain it?
2018-12-06 21:25:10	~ben	i mean gitea isn't a git client
2018-12-06 21:25:23	~ben	but yeah
2018-12-06 21:32:23	ubergeek	well, it kinda is.  You can do everything there, and never touch the "git" command
2018-12-06 21:32:38	ubergeek	But I get what you're saying too
2018-12-06 21:37:33	~ben	does it have an editor on the web?
2018-12-06 21:37:42	~ben	if so, i've never used it
2018-12-06 21:38:13	~ben	woah it does
2018-12-06 21:40:01	aewens	I've now also mirrored the IPv32 thing to Medium, because why not? https://medium.com/@aewens/ipv32-4fd364df670e
2018-12-06 21:40:31	~ben	medium is kinda meh
2018-12-06 21:40:39	~ben	but nice :)
2018-12-06 21:43:34	aewens	I'm considering making a distributed blogging deployment system to maximize viewership, and one of the vectors I'm considering is Medium (along with maybe dev.to?)
2018-12-06 21:43:56	aewens	The idea being I can write it once in Markdown and push to deploy to a bunch of targets.
2018-12-06 21:46:35	ubergeek	Make a jenkins job for it!
2018-12-06 21:47:28	aewens	I've never used jenkins, so that will be a maybe

2018-12-08 19:49:18	jackomix3	i just got an answer from stack overflow]
2018-12-08 19:49:42	ubergeek	Oh, that code doesn't really do anything.  Seems like you're trying to get a dir list, and create a set of links?
2018-12-08 19:52:28	jackomix3	yeah
2018-12-08 19:52:34	ubergeek	I *believe* this is close to what you're looking for: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2922954/getting-the-names-of-all-files-in-a-directory-with-php
2018-12-08 19:52:53	jan6	I have a direcotry listing script on my page, that might help
2018-12-08 19:53:06	jackomix3	what's the page?

2018-12-08 19:54:29	jackomix3	how can i see the code?
2018-12-08 19:55:20	jan6	well, however you want! it should be readable to all
2018-12-08 19:55:41	jan6	cat or nano or even scp it to your local machine, I guess

2018-12-09 01:31:10	ubergeek	Parent proc?
2018-12-09 01:31:20	ubergeek	Or, the tmux scrollback?
2018-12-09 01:31:50	ubergeek	I should probably set up a cron to alert me when my resource usage is...  Exhorbitant.

2018-12-09 19:06:37	mastergeek	do we have permission to set up crontabs? I don't want to water my plant manually every day
2018-12-09 19:15:34	jan6	sure
2018-12-09 19:15:39	jan6	crontab -e
2018-12-09 19:16:07	mastergeek	and is cron running
2018-12-09 19:16:08	jan6	I mean, sure it's nice to ask, but I think it'd be disabled if it wasn't allowed ;P
2018-12-09 19:16:26	jan6	just try it out, sure it works
2018-12-09 19:16:33	jan6	at least I think it does
2018-12-09 19:16:38	mastergeek	I'll check it out then
2018-12-09 19:20:42	mastergeek	jan6: yeah, works like a charm
2018-12-09 19:20:50	jan6	 ;)
2018-12-09 19:20:50	mastergeek	mah plant will grow without me now :)
2018-12-09 19:21:28	jan6	oh btw, make sure you're handling the harvest, else it'll mess up ;)
2018-12-09 19:21:46	mastergeek	oh, ...
2018-12-09 19:22:39	jan6	btw, what's your script?
2018-12-09 19:23:31	jan6	mine is real simple
2018-12-09 19:23:34	mastergeek	echo -e -n "1\n6\n"
2018-12-09 19:24:29	jan6	simple correction
2018-12-09 19:24:39	jan6	echo -e "\n6\ny\n6\n"
2018-12-09 19:24:51	jan6	at least that
2018-12-09 19:24:57	jan6	's what I use on ~town
2018-12-09 19:25:27	mastergeek	like, another user's garden?
2018-12-09 19:25:44	jan6	nah
2018-12-09 19:25:46	jan6	mine
2018-12-09 19:26:12	mastergeek	kk
2018-12-09 19:26:13	jan6	basically enter to water, 6 to exit, if it's harvest then 6 to harvest, "yes want to harvest", 6 to exit, boom
2018-12-09 19:26:35	mastergeek	oh, ok
2018-12-09 19:27:14	jan6	just running that each hour, which is overkill tbh
2018-12-09 19:27:28	jan6	it'd be fine if you ran it like every 6 hours, even
2018-12-09 19:28:42	jan6	and I think there's old botany here, so it might mess up sometimes, so good idea to back up your ~/.botany occassionally
2018-12-09 19:29:51	jan6	(I've autofarmed to level 17 on ~town, lol, growth rate of 4.2, the higher the level the more you have to lose I guess)
2018-12-09 19:32:11	mastergeek	I run it once every day at 9:15 but ok
2018-12-09 19:32:34	jan6	that's fine probably ;P
2018-12-09 19:32:39	mastergeek	I'll try to make backups of it, also another thing I want to ask
2018-12-09 19:32:44	jan6	as I said, mine's definitely overkill
2018-12-09 19:33:02	jan6	every time I've checked it it's been ~90% watered, lol

2018-12-09 21:08:19	~ben	that's rough
2018-12-09 21:08:48	jan6	just like, what, 80% of all terminal emulators either by default, or with the help of a plugin/addon, allow to autoopen links
2018-12-09 21:08:58	~ben	auto open links?
2018-12-09 21:09:01	~ben	what do you mean
2018-12-09 21:09:05	~ben	i just ctrl-click them
2018-12-09 21:09:25	jan6	I just regular click them
2018-12-09 21:09:43	~ben	doesn't work for me

2018-12-10 02:47:03	~ben	have you gone outdoor skydiving before?
2018-12-10 02:47:06	~ben	i wonder how it compares

2018-12-10 02:49:24	@cmccabe	to

2018-12-10 02:50:49	@cmccabe	this place today made no mention of thr similarity to real skydiving, and i wasn't sure if that's because they're different or because they don't want to lose customers to the real thing
2018-12-10 02:51:06	~ben	i'd guess they're very different experiences
2018-12-10 02:51:17	~ben	with nothing else to compare it to
2018-12-10 02:51:22	@cmccabe	no parachute, for one
2018-12-10 02:51:35	~ben	heh right
2018-12-10 02:51:43	~ben	isn't it basically just a big wind tunnel?

2018-12-10 05:26:24	~ben	js is not very good for OOP
2018-12-10 05:43:38	robdrake	It's not OOP, it's function prototyping or the generic javascript object

2018-12-10 07:04:56	robdrake	Anyone good at javascript? I'm high, and ideas are flowing

2018-12-10 07:16:59	~ben	but i like a language with standardized formatting
2018-12-10 07:17:13	~ben	elixir has a built-in formatter, as does go
2018-12-10 07:17:35	fosslinux	it's not a "misfeature" robdrake, it was put there on purpose. however i would agree that it's not one of the better points of py
2018-12-10 07:17:54	robdrake	I just  prefer 4 blanks / tab, and tabs as tabs
2018-12-10 07:18:23	fosslinux	fair

2018-12-10 07:20:53	fosslinux	geany is very nice for simple gui coding
2018-12-10 07:21:39	robdrake	linting, building, and executing is configurable, but no built in debugger
2018-12-10 07:21:58	fosslinux	true....
2018-12-10 07:22:03	fosslinux	"simple"
2018-12-10 07:22:04	robdrake	and I don't get emacs
2018-12-10 07:22:12	fosslinux	emacs makes no sense to me
2018-12-10 07:22:22	~ben	lol same
2018-12-10 07:22:25	~ben	people love it though
2018-12-10 07:22:34	robdrake	I do not need the kitchen sink, I need an editor
2018-12-10 07:22:36	fosslinux	did you know emacs has a built in philosipher
2018-12-10 07:22:54	~ben	g
2018-12-10 07:22:56	~ben	ope
2018-12-10 07:22:57	robdrake	and psychiatrist
2018-12-10 07:23:06	~ben	yeah M-x doctor
2018-12-10 07:23:08	~ben	lol
2018-12-10 07:23:12	fosslinux	lmao it was the funniest thing i ever did
2018-12-10 07:23:38	fosslinux	and then my brother and sister were hanging over my shoulder
2018-12-10 07:23:46	fosslinux	(younger)
2018-12-10 07:23:49	fosslinux	and then it said
2018-12-10 07:23:58	fosslinux	"and how is your sex life?"
2018-12-10 07:24:04	fosslinux	i was like oh crap and closed it :P
2018-12-10 07:24:15	giteabot	[team/site] Ben Harris pushed 5041ab5 to master. (make sure index.php exists before sha1'ing it; https://tildegit.org/team/site/commit/5041ab5)
2018-12-10 07:24:38	fosslinux	lol i was going to talk to you about that just then ben 
2018-12-10 07:25:41	robdrake	 a misfeature is not a bug, but thw wrong thing as far as features go
2018-12-10 07:29:25	~ben	there are still a few false positives from an old version of the default page
2018-12-10 07:37:14	giteabot	[team/site] Ben Harris pushed 5b56f74 to master. (check against previous sha1s; https://tildegit.org/team/site/commit/5b56f74)
2018-12-10 07:37:49	~ben	ok fixed
2018-12-10 07:38:08	~ben	i also added a note that you should make some changes if you're not on the list
2018-12-10 07:39:42	giteabot	[team/site] Ben Harris pushed 2 commits to master. (check against previous sha1s, check against previous sha1s; https://tildegit.org/team/site/compare/5b56f74baac37e4f548539e5de26ad2945691981...b50f86feb3a257fdc853a47950547fbfc31f0d0b)
2018-12-10 07:41:24	~ben	night all
2018-12-10 07:41:45	robdrake	night
2018-12-10 07:44:46	<--	robdrake (rgdrake@tilde.team) has quit (quit: WeeChat 2.3)
2018-12-10 07:44:58	-->	rgdrake (rgdrake@tilde.team) has joined #team
2018-12-10 07:45:35	--	rgdrake is now known as robdrake
2018-12-10 13:23:57	amcclure	does ~team have an ftp server?
2018-12-10 13:33:29	erxeto	I thik it does not. Any reason you cannot use sftp/scp ?
2018-12-10 13:34:09	amcclure	oh
2018-12-10 13:34:40	amcclure	not exactly what I was thinking of lol
2018-12-10 13:35:09	amcclure	I was thinking of something similar to the already existing web and gopher services
2018-12-10 13:35:52	amcclure	something like ftp://ftp.tilde.team/~<username>
2018-12-10 13:36:55	amcclure	kind of like how I was using ftp.thunix.org for mirrors and user content
2018-12-10 13:37:14	snurryboy	hmm does it need to be ftp?
2018-12-10 13:37:22	snurryboy	why not http
2018-12-10 13:46:59	amcclure	snurryboy: http://tilde.team/~<username> is already a thing
2018-12-10 13:47:28	snurryboy	yea i thought you might just have wanted a way to show a list of files that can be downloaded
2018-12-10 13:47:38	amcclure	oh
2018-12-10 13:47:45	amcclure	nginx has directory browsing 
2018-12-10 13:48:48	snurryboy	oh cool
2018-12-10 13:48:57	snurryboy	whats the need for ftp then?
2018-12-10 13:48:57	amcclure	I was thinking of ftp.tilde.team being more like gopher.tilde.team
2018-12-10 13:49:26	snurryboy	i dont know anything about gopher
2018-12-10 13:49:36	amcclure	oh
2018-12-10 13:54:09	amcclure	I still think it would be a good thing to have
2018-12-10 13:54:22	ubergeek	don't do ftp, please :)
2018-12-10 13:54:40	ubergeek	Unless it's for super unimportant files
2018-12-10 13:54:56	~ben	https://gopher.tilde.team is a gopher proxy
2018-12-10 13:54:59	cirno	[tilde.team]
2018-12-10 13:55:10	ubergeek	I die a little every time I see a new ftp server go into production lol
2018-12-10 13:55:10	~ben	and autoindex is already on for user dirs
2018-12-10 13:55:20	~ben	there's no reason to do so
2018-12-10 13:55:22	amcclure	rip ubergeek 
2018-12-10 13:55:46	amcclure	apt-get install vsftpd
2018-12-10 13:55:54	 *	ubergeek has sad-face
2018-12-10 13:55:59	amcclure	jk
2018-12-10 13:56:06	ubergeek	... there goes another 2% of my soul :P
2018-12-10 13:56:15	amcclure	i used microsoft iis ftp server
2018-12-10 13:56:36	ubergeek	Ok, now you're doing this intentionally, just to hurt me hahaha
2018-12-10 13:56:47	amcclure	i think it hurt my wallet more tbh
2018-12-10 13:57:08	ubergeek	brb, going to start a tilde server running on WSL on Win 10
2018-12-10 13:57:33	amcclure	time to make my own tilde server on Windows 2016
2018-12-10 13:58:08	 *	ubergeek wonders how well, exactly, that would work...
2018-12-10 13:58:13	ubergeek	One can install openssh...
2018-12-10 13:58:26	ubergeek	You can compile code on it, install python, etc etc...
2018-12-10 13:58:37	ubergeek	It'd be expensive, for sure, but different...
2018-12-10 13:58:41	amcclure	I don't use Windows on anything lol
2018-12-10 13:59:28	amcclure	and I don't really miss Windows at all tbh
2018-12-10 14:00:07	amcclure	also windows server licensing takes a few thousand dollars for everything
2018-12-10 14:01:54	amcclure	and considering GNU/Linux is a thing, it's not worth paying extra money for a microsoft logo
2018-12-10 14:02:07	amcclure	Windows does come with a lot of free stuff though
2018-12-10 14:02:58	~ben	delet widnows
2018-12-10 14:03:07	amcclure	like free blue screens, migranes from maintainence, security issues,
2018-12-10 14:03:28	amcclure	and so on
2018-12-10 14:03:32	~ben	bonus!
2018-12-10 14:03:44	snurryboy	i also hate windows
2018-12-10 14:03:55	 *	amcclure is a former windows server sysadmin
2018-12-10 14:03:56	jan6	eh
2018-12-10 14:03:58	snurryboy	ive used a mac for a year but been on debian as well the last month or two
2018-12-10 14:03:59	~ben	i get to use it at work
2018-12-10 14:04:02	~ben	yay legacy apps
2018-12-10 14:04:02	 *	amcclure doesn't like windows anymore
2018-12-10 14:04:16	amcclure	mac is worse than Windows imo
2018-12-10 14:04:21	jan6	why so?
2018-12-10 14:04:24	snurryboy	no way
2018-12-10 14:04:42	~ben	i don't like mac either
2018-12-10 14:04:44	snurryboy	not only do i like the gui better its got a much better terminal
2018-12-10 14:04:47	jan6	mac is just Different™ and Luxury™, not Bad™
2018-12-10 14:04:56	~ben	overpriced and locked down
2018-12-10 14:04:58	jan6	it IS a unix after all, so it's not that bad
2018-12-10 14:05:07	snurryboy	people hate on macs but its really apple that sucks
2018-12-10 14:05:09	jan6	^
2018-12-10 14:05:16	snurryboy	and when you buy second hand price isnt a factor
2018-12-10 14:05:16	~ben	that's fair i guess
2018-12-10 14:05:24	amcclure	a good friend and I both got nearly identical macbook pros around the same time
2018-12-10 14:05:27	snurryboy	it was cheaper for me to get this imac than any desktop set up
2018-12-10 14:05:38	amcclure	within a month the keyboard broke
2018-12-10 14:05:43	jan6	tbh, Mac Minis are quite cool
2018-12-10 14:05:53	snurryboy	yea i agree they make shit keyboards and mice
2018-12-10 14:06:02	amcclure	and a few keys popped off of the keyboard with no way to reattach it
2018-12-10 14:06:04	snurryboy	i use my own keyboard and mouse with it
2018-12-10 14:06:25	jan6	AND the cheapest macs, AND actually openable without breaking it, and make for nice little server machines and such
2018-12-10 14:08:29	snurryboy	yea i got a late 2015 imac the other year cause id been using a windows laptop for like the past 6 years and never tried mac in my life except when someone gave me one of those old tower ones they used to make but never really played around with it
2018-12-10 14:08:53	snurryboy	ive never really had any dramas with it
2018-12-10 14:09:10	amcclure	I still have an old tower pc
2018-12-10 14:09:18	~ben	i built my desktop for gaming so i dualboot windows and debian
2018-12-10 14:09:20	snurryboy	i do prefer debian but yea i still enjoy my mac and find it easy to work with\
2018-12-10 14:09:38	amcclure	got it with windows 2000 but it works great (maybe better) with Debian
2018-12-10 14:09:39	~ben	hard to get debian to use my 1080ti properly
2018-12-10 14:09:39	snurryboy	my biggest gripe is that its so RAM hungry
2018-12-10 14:10:04	snurryboy	gotta restart or purge ever other day if ive been opening a bunch of browser tabs and aps
2018-12-10 14:10:09	~ben	last time i used a mac was for an app dev course in undergrad and it was slow af
2018-12-10 14:10:12	ubergeek	I prefer Mac over Windows...  But only use either when forced to.
2018-12-10 14:10:13	~ben	ios sux
2018-12-10 14:10:19	amcclure	true
2018-12-10 14:10:42	snurryboy	i find ios and android to be pretty similar except when it comes to the jailbreak community
2018-12-10 14:10:44	ubergeek	Basically, any non-Linux machine acts as an expensive virtualization platform for me to run Linux in a VM
2018-12-10 14:10:46	snurryboy	then ios comes ahead
2018-12-10 14:11:01	~ben	???
2018-12-10 14:11:05	~ben	how so
2018-12-10 14:11:21	~ben	can't say i've ever heard anyone say ios jailbreak is better than rooting
2018-12-10 14:11:23	snurryboy	the amount of tweaks you can get is nuts
2018-12-10 14:11:28	ubergeek	ben:  because there's only a handful of hardware platforms, and one OS to jailbreak
2018-12-10 14:11:31	amcclure	when someone calls GNU/Linux macos, I die
2018-12-10 14:11:36	jan6	android VM on jailbroken iphone?
2018-12-10 14:11:53	ubergeek	With Android, it's always a roll of the dice IF you can even root
2018-12-10 14:11:55	snurryboy	rooting is great if you are prepared to create the tweaks you want yourself
2018-12-10 14:12:06	~ben	i haven't had to create any tweaks myself
2018-12-10 14:12:07	ubergeek	My Note 9 will likely never get rooted, or custom ROMs :(
2018-12-10 14:12:19	amcclure	:(
2018-12-10 14:12:19	jan6	android root is a gamble IF you can get unlocked bootloader and root, but once you do, you can do LITERALLY anything
2018-12-10 14:12:22	~ben	but i have a pixel with a factory unlockable bootloader
2018-12-10 14:12:25	snurryboy	its like rooting a kindle. they only have so many things you can do with it
2018-12-10 14:12:27	ubergeek	But that is Samsung's fault, not Android's
2018-12-10 14:12:35	~ben	yeah that's vendor-specific i guess
2018-12-10 14:12:42	snurryboy	Cydia has like anything you could ever think of
2018-12-10 14:12:52	~ben	i think there was one phone i had problems rooting
2018-12-10 14:12:55	jan6	unlocked bootloader = you can put full on debian on your phone if you want to, lol
2018-12-10 14:12:58	ubergeek	snurryboy: have you like, ever, used Android? lol
2018-12-10 14:13:07	snurryboy	but ios jailbreaking is getting harder and harder so itll probably be gone before long
2018-12-10 14:13:16	jan6	there is cydia substrate on android too, but near nothing uses it :(
2018-12-10 14:13:19	snurryboy	uhh yea my first two phones were android and i still use one of them
2018-12-10 14:13:20	ubergeek	Can Cydia allow you to install a new kernel?
2018-12-10 14:13:22	snurryboy	which is rooted
2018-12-10 14:13:38	~ben	full new rom? system-wide theming?
2018-12-10 14:13:41	amcclure	I want to get a custom rom on my phone
2018-12-10 14:13:41	ubergeek	... or to remove that ghastly apple boot logo?
2018-12-10 14:13:46	jan6	cydia is just basically alternate app store + theme engine, afaik
2018-12-10 14:13:51	ubergeek	^^^
2018-12-10 14:13:51	amcclure	but it'll go against the carrier's policies :(
2018-12-10 14:13:51	snurryboy	p much yes to all of that.
2018-12-10 14:14:03	snurryboy	apparently someone got android working on an iphone
2018-12-10 14:14:13	snurryboy	and yes you can remove the boot logo
2018-12-10 14:14:22	snurryboy	or replace it with any image/gif you want
2018-12-10 14:14:24	jan6	apparently someone got debian working on their android too
2018-12-10 14:15:04	jan6	tbh, that' be pretty cool to have full on debian with working touch drivers on a phone
2018-12-10 14:15:09	ubergeek	lots of people got debian working on their android :)
2018-12-10 14:15:15	amcclure	would be cool
2018-12-10 14:15:27	snurryboy	im trying to get debian on my kindle touch
2018-12-10 14:15:29	snurryboy	lol
2018-12-10 14:15:32	jan6	getting drivers to work is probably an issue tho
2018-12-10 14:15:38	amcclure	I have an android tablet I never use, I kind of want to get Debian for it now
2018-12-10 14:15:41	ubergeek	https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cuntubuntu&hl=en_US

2018-12-10 14:15:50	jan6	if you have usb-otg then you just use a mouse, I bet, lol
2018-12-10 14:15:59	jan6	debian noroot is cheating ;P
2018-12-10 14:16:04	ubergeek	lol
2018-12-10 14:16:15	snurryboy	is that really debian or just a launcher/skin
2018-12-10 14:16:17	jan6	it's basically usermode-chroot
2018-12-10 14:16:21	jan6	afaik
2018-12-10 14:16:23	ubergeek	basically yeah
2018-12-10 14:16:29	ubergeek	same as Linux-On-DeX
2018-12-10 14:17:13	snurryboy	anyone tried those linux mobile OS like sailfish
2018-12-10 14:17:50	jan6	no chance, lol, 1. not supported phone (very limited set for sailfish, iirc) 2. currently locked bootloader
2018-12-10 14:18:17	jan6	all I've run have been custom android 2.3 roms xD
2018-12-10 14:18:21	amcclure	could make a channel for android os/device development and rooting
2018-12-10 14:18:23	snurryboy	dang
2018-12-10 14:18:34	amcclure	#android anyone?
2018-12-10 14:18:41	snurryboy	i dont know enough about it except i like it
2018-12-10 14:18:44	snurryboy	heh
2018-12-10 14:18:55	jan6	heh
2018-12-10 14:18:55	snurryboy	Plasma Mobile
2018-12-10 14:18:57	snurryboy	damn
2018-12-10 14:19:04	snurryboy	i love kde desktop
2018-12-10 14:19:52	jan6	I'd love to have root, but can't, pretty sure you can't hax the bootloader without very specific knowledge
2018-12-10 14:20:18	snurryboy	the one i use is htc desire 420
2018-12-10 14:20:35	snurryboy	its rooted every time ive tried over the years
2018-12-10 14:21:04	snurryboy	but the only reason i needed it was to go up a few android versions than what it would let me on stock
2018-12-10 14:21:13	snurryboy	so i could download a couple of apps
2018-12-10 14:22:52	jan6	android emulators?
2018-12-10 14:23:25	snurryboy	nah a mirroring app so i can get the screen of the newer phone onto the old phone
2018-12-10 14:23:38	jan6	vnc server?
2018-12-10 14:23:43	jan6	;P
2018-12-10 14:24:35	jan6	vnc viewer apps can be like, a meg or less, and server can be run even without root iirc...
2018-12-10 14:24:45	snurryboy	cause i record video on the newer phone with this head mount i had custom made to have the video sync with the binaural headset
2018-12-10 14:25:03	snurryboy	and i can watch on the old phone to make sure its running right
2018-12-10 14:25:27	snurryboy	i forget what its called. amirror something or other.
2018-12-10 14:25:48	snurryboy	its cross platform if i need it
2018-12-10 14:43:00	amcclure	weird question
2018-12-10 14:43:45	amcclure	I was given a microsoft surface rt at one time and I'd like to install Debian on it. Anyone know how?
2018-12-10 14:44:04	~ben	probably doable
2018-12-10 14:44:27	snurryboy	cant boot from a usb?
2018-12-10 14:44:51	amcclure	I can
2018-12-10 14:45:15	snurryboy	then get firmware-9.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso
2018-12-10 14:45:34	snurryboy	i write it with fedora media writer but anything should work
2018-12-10 14:45:53	jan6	just dd it, if you want

2018-12-10 14:46:09	snurryboy	just means 64bit
2018-12-10 14:46:13	snurryboy	im p certain
2018-12-10 14:46:17	~ben	yeah
2018-12-10 14:46:18	amcclure	for a surface rt?
2018-12-10 14:46:35	~ben	can't think of any reason it would be 32bit
2018-12-10 14:46:37	jan6	or etcher.io if you want a fancy electron-based app that verifies it wrote correctly
2018-12-10 14:46:40	snurryboy	yea it should work fine on any 64 bit
2018-12-10 14:46:56	jan6	^
2018-12-10 14:47:50	jan6	that's the netinstall that includes most drivers, so it's supposed to get everything working even if there aren't "free and open source drivers" for it
2018-12-10 14:47:57	amcclure	it's not 64 bit though lol
2018-12-10 14:48:05	jan6	128 bit?
2018-12-10 14:48:06	jan6	;P
2018-12-10 14:48:08	snurryboy	lol
2018-12-10 14:48:14	snurryboy	are you serious its 32 bit
2018-12-10 14:48:23	jan6	lol, only 4gigs of ram
2018-12-10 14:48:25	snurryboy	i cant imagine a 1000$ new laptop is 32bit
2018-12-10 14:48:43	amcclure	surface rt was from 2012 lol
2018-12-10 14:48:46	jan6	RIP having more than 5 tabs open at a time I guess
2018-12-10 14:48:48	amcclure	2011 or 2012
2018-12-10 14:48:57	amcclure	I can't exactly rememver
2018-12-10 14:49:07	snurryboy	oh i thought those things were brand new

2018-12-10 14:49:11	sedbot	<amcclure> I can't exactly remember

2018-12-10 14:50:24	snurryboy	that should be for you then
2018-12-10 14:51:13	amcclure	actually
2018-12-10 14:51:28	~ben	wow it's 32bit
2018-12-10 14:51:30	~ben	:o
2018-12-10 14:51:51	amcclure	I think it'll be either armel or armhf
2018-12-10 14:51:52	jan6	is it ARM or x86 tho ?
2018-12-10 14:52:07	amcclure	it's ARM
2018-12-10 14:52:11	jan6	yeah, arm versions are different too
2018-12-10 14:52:20	jan6	but of course, debian covers that too ;P
2018-12-10 14:52:30	snurryboy	yea ive never used that so i cant help
2018-12-10 14:52:31	snurryboy	lol

2018-12-10 14:53:04	snurryboy	one of those
2018-12-10 14:53:32	~ben	good thing debian covers pretty much any combo you can think of 
2018-12-10 14:53:42	~ben	9.6 feels like a solid point upgrade
2018-12-10 14:53:50	jan6	In Debian GNU/Linux, and derivatives such as Ubuntu, armhf (ARM hard float) refers to the ARMv7 architecture
2018-12-10 14:54:24	jan6	so, figure out if it's before or after arm7
2018-12-10 14:55:06	amcclure	"32-bit ARM (ARMv7)"
2018-12-10 14:55:18	amcclure	would I use hard float?
2018-12-10 14:55:19	snurryboy	thats a bingo
2018-12-10 14:56:24	jan6	it should be armhf according to quick hunt
2018-12-10 14:57:01	jan6	https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037671/surface-surface-rt-specifications says the cpu is nvidia tegra 3

2018-12-10 14:57:55	jan6	so yah
2018-12-10 14:58:58	~ben	that could be a nice little debian box
2018-12-10 15:01:30	amcclure	got grub to load
2018-12-10 15:01:42	amcclure	now 
2018-12-10 15:02:14	amcclure	one of the only real problems I've had with this is the lack of reliable documentation for installing debian or any other os
2018-12-10 15:02:39	amcclure	since the only thing people seemed to focus on is "windows rt 8 is locked down nothing works on it"

2018-12-10 15:03:41	snurryboy	that might help
2018-12-10 15:05:07	jan6	ehhh
2018-12-10 15:05:19	jan6	what is there TO say about installing, lol
2018-12-10 15:05:28	jan6	you just answer any prompts, and boom
2018-12-10 15:05:53	amcclure	that link is also for Windows lol
2018-12-10 15:06:21	jan6	I personally like to disable print server and the default desktop managers, and install them later
2018-12-10 15:06:58	~ben	i don't install print server either but i usually just have it install gnome for me
2018-12-10 15:07:01	~ben	don't @ me
2018-12-10 15:07:06	~ben	i know everyone hates gnome
2018-12-10 15:07:11	jan6	eh
2018-12-10 15:07:21	snurryboy	the writing the iso is for windows but the debian installation is still relevant
2018-12-10 15:07:22	jan6	cinnamon is nicer, I'd say
2018-12-10 15:07:26	snurryboy	and thats what you asked about
2018-12-10 15:07:36	jan6	but gnome is fine, just Eh, It's Hungery
2018-12-10 15:07:48	~ben	it's not bad with 3.30 actually
2018-12-10 15:07:59	jan6	3d n stuff
2018-12-10 15:08:09	jan6	it's not Bad, just not Good either
2018-12-10 15:08:23	snurryboy	i dont like the app manager window thjing one bit
2018-12-10 15:08:35	~ben	which one?
2018-12-10 15:08:44	jan6	^not terrible, but yeah, indeed
2018-12-10 15:08:47	snurryboy	like i search for something and still all the other apps are behind it and fully opaque
2018-12-10 15:09:01	snurryboy	gnome
2018-12-10 15:09:02	jan6	which is exactly why I enable th traditional dropdown menu option ;P
2018-12-10 15:09:18	snurryboy	i accidently installed it first time when i was trying to do kde
2018-12-10 15:09:40	~ben	i just install dash-to-dock and it's perfectly fine for everything i need
2018-12-10 15:10:00	~ben	pretty much in a browser and a terminal
2018-12-10 15:10:01	snurryboy	if i could replace kde's start menu with a dock and have one of the apps be like macs launchpad then itd be perfect
2018-12-10 15:10:02	~ben	and that' it
2018-12-10 15:10:16	~ben	what's a launchpad
2018-12-10 15:10:47	jan6	the thingy at the bottom f the screen?
2018-12-10 15:11:02	snurryboy	well if you left click it it brings up all the apps kinda like in that app manager in gnome. but what i use it for is if you right click it it shows a list of all your stuff in applications directory
2018-12-10 15:11:05	snurryboy	in order
2018-12-10 15:11:19	snurryboy	makes it simple to get to any app you dont use enough to put on the dock
2018-12-10 15:11:28	snurryboy	the thingy at the bottom is the dock
2018-12-10 15:11:35	~ben	huh i'm not familiar
2018-12-10 15:11:39	jan6	just have a dropdown app menu then?
2018-12-10 15:11:41	snurryboy	launchpad is an app
2018-12-10 15:11:53	~ben	i usually hit meta (windows key), type a few letters of what i'm looking for and hit enter
2018-12-10 15:12:16	~ben	doesn't mac have a quick find thing like that too
2018-12-10 15:12:33	jan6	alt = meta tho?
2018-12-10 15:12:45	jan6	or no?
2018-12-10 15:12:50	snurryboy	yea i forget what its called
2018-12-10 15:12:51	~ben	super
2018-12-10 15:12:53	~ben	sry
2018-12-10 15:12:55	jan6	yep
2018-12-10 15:12:56	snurryboy	spotlight or something
2018-12-10 15:13:12	snurryboy	yea spotlight
2018-12-10 15:13:16	~ben	that's what i used the whole time when i had to for that ios part of mobile dev
2018-12-10 15:13:25	~ben	whatever undergrad course that was
2018-12-10 15:13:26	jan6	on cinnamon I too have win/super open the app menu with focused search bar
2018-12-10 15:13:48	jan6	cinnamon is basically gnome, but a bit different direction
2018-12-10 15:14:30	 *	jan6 out btw, for some time at least, minimum 2 hours, I'd say
2018-12-10 15:14:39	~ben	no u
2018-12-10 15:14:50	jan6	yes me
2018-12-10 15:14:59	snurryboy	https://i.imgur.com/PZhhVzT.png
2018-12-10 15:15:06	snurryboy	thats what i mean about the launchpad
2018-12-10 15:15:33	~ben	ew why then you have to use the mouse
2018-12-10 15:15:44	snurryboy	what do you mean?
2018-12-10 15:15:47	~ben	spotlight,
2018-12-10 15:15:57	snurryboy	i dont like spotlight
2018-12-10 15:15:57	~ben	then just type the name of the thing you want to launch
2018-12-10 15:16:07	snurryboy	i prefer this
2018-12-10 15:16:07	jan6	my super key opens the menu from "all apps" category by default btw
2018-12-10 15:16:16	~ben	yeah same
2018-12-10 15:16:29	~ben	super, type what you want to open, hit enter
2018-12-10 15:16:33	snurryboy	its kinda like a start bar but not compartmentalising every category
2018-12-10 15:17:01	~ben	i try to avoid using the mouse as much as possible
2018-12-10 15:17:29	~ben	that's a lot of mousing around you could avoid with spotlight
2018-12-10 15:17:56	snurryboy	i enjoy mousin around lol
2018-12-10 15:18:11	snurryboy	except on laptops
2018-12-10 15:18:20	snurryboy	cause trackpads usually suck
2018-12-10 15:18:51	snurryboy	but even then i feel constricted not being able to move around the screen smoothly
2018-12-10 15:19:38	~ben	heh there's another reason to keyboard it up
2018-12-10 15:19:39	snurryboy	if i was big into efficiency id get something like alfred and learn how to use it properly
2018-12-10 15:20:06	~ben	it's not even efficiency i just would rather use the keyboard if i can
2018-12-10 15:21:06	snurryboy	see im the opposite. ill only use keyboard for typing if its not too annoying to use the mouse
2018-12-10 15:21:33	~ben	lol fair enough
2018-12-10 15:21:46	snurryboy	like scrolling can be a pain in the ass with a mouse since i dont have one with those flash scroll wheel that spin on a bering
2018-12-10 15:21:48	~ben	i've found kb to be far faster
2018-12-10 15:22:08	~ben	oh i have a mouse with a crazy fast scroll wheel
2018-12-10 15:22:15	~ben	that's one thing i like the mouse for
2018-12-10 15:23:00	snurryboy	ok i gotta get up early so im off to bed
2018-12-10 15:23:05	snurryboy	later ben

2018-12-10 20:08:37	robdrake	Solid's motto: Own your Data
2018-12-10 20:10:45	robdrake	but Safe, the tool, would make kiddie porn and nastier material distribution easier
2018-12-10 20:11:46	robdrake	sorry if I'm rambling, just excited about those 2 projects
2018-12-10 20:12:47	jan6	so basically, tor problems
2018-12-10 20:18:14	robdrake	yeah
2018-12-10 20:18:52	robdrake	but with SAFE, the data is broken up into chunks and each chunk is encrypted
2018-12-10 20:19:12	robdrake	and spread amongst SAFE servers
2018-12-10 20:54:22	@khuxkm|lounge	robdrake: let me take a look RE Solid
2018-12-10 20:59:40	@khuxkm|lounge	robdrake: so why do you need port forward for SOLID
2018-12-10 20:59:41	@khuxkm|lounge	?
2018-12-10 20:59:53	@khuxkm|lounge	does it need port 8443, is what I'm asking
2018-12-10 21:01:37	@khuxkm|lounge	also maybe we could run solid for tilde.team users
2018-12-10 21:01:43	@khuxkm|lounge	rgdrake.solid.tilde.team?
2018-12-10 21:03:23	robdrake	any port
2018-12-10 21:04:04	robdrake	if you are  going to do it for tilde.team just solid.tilde.team
2018-12-10 21:04:04	@khuxkm|lounge	so what I'm thinking is either A) we decide on running a multiuser SOLID for tilde.team members or B) we get you an LXD container and port-forward it in (you
2018-12-10 21:04:09	@khuxkm|lounge	...
2018-12-10 21:04:32	@khuxkm|lounge	(you'll have to use rgdrake.whateverdomainyouchoose.wehavealot:443)
2018-12-10 21:04:52	robdrake	I'd say tilde.team members
2018-12-10 21:05:55	robdrake	that will save ~rgdrake for client apps using the server
2018-12-10 21:06:39	robdrake	*client apps running in the browser
2018-12-10 21:07:40	robdrake	but please, the more users, the better, so a tilde.team Solid server would be good
2018-12-10 21:08:05	robdrake	Helps to get the word out to "Own Your Data"
2018-12-10 21:08:25	jan6	why 443?
2018-12-10 21:08:39	jan6	80 would be better, cause https > http ?
2018-12-10 21:09:03	robdrake	8443 is just a commonly used port
2018-12-10 21:09:09	jan6	firewalls
2018-12-10 21:09:27	jan6	but sure
2018-12-10 21:09:47	jan6	I guess you can always ssh-portforward it?
2018-12-10 21:09:56	robdrake	idk
2018-12-10 21:13:03	robdrake	I'm trying to answer all questions I can

2018-12-10 21:25:04	tomasino	hah
2018-12-10 21:25:06	robdrake	if you are going to operate the server, why not the tilde brand? A bit of advertising

2018-12-12 20:58:49	BabiliBot	[bbj] 'How many users?' (cmccabe) : related to this question, i checked on monday and  found 60 distinct users that had logged in between saturday and then, and over 1500 total logins  during that period.  this is a huge increase relative to early 2018, and judging by the pace of new user sign-ups, it has the potential to grow a lot more over the next year.  ben will be renting a dedicated server room for tilde.team soon. <https://bbj.tilde.team/index.php?threa

2018-12-12 21:23:12	jan6	hmm
2018-12-12 21:23:28	jan6	@ that, I'd say...a user graph, someone?
2018-12-12 22:42:06	~ben	hm?
2018-12-12 22:43:23	jan6	"this is a huge increase" blablabla, so it'd be cool to have an automatic graph showing online & registred users over time
2018-12-12 22:43:43	jan6	probably average per day, or such, by default
2018-12-12 22:44:09	jan6	or per week, rather, with optional per-day one
2018-12-12 22:46:29	~ben	oh yeah that could be cool
2018-12-12 22:50:38	jan6	I guess once the thing is done it's easy to tweak for a per-day or per-month or per-week or per-year graph

2018-12-13 20:38:34	~ben	you have an interesting sleep schedule :P
2018-12-13 20:55:02	robdrake	just depends on when I need to rest
2018-12-13 21:20:12	~ben	fair enough
2018-12-13 21:30:37	edwardthefma	The mail list thing is cool but I forgot I use my tilde team account to bounce emails

2018-12-13 21:35:53	~ben	i can make a list for that if you like

2018-12-13 21:37:02	edwardthefma	But you need to sub to it instead of being default every body subbed

2018-12-14 02:33:25	deepend	not alot apparently. pretty quiet 
2018-12-14 02:36:21	@cmccabe	deepend: how is your~ going?  i've been meaning to spend more time there.
2018-12-14 02:37:39	deepend	its going pretty good.. Kinda been focused more on the tildeverse as a whole instead of things just on your~.   But as a whole is going good :)

2018-12-14 18:41:36	~ben	heh who knows
2018-12-14 18:44:00	robdrake	anything I can do to help tilde.team?
2018-12-14 18:47:58	@cmccabe	hi erxeto 
2018-12-14 18:48:18	@cmccabe	robdrake: want to help write tutorials for the ~team linux learning program?
2018-12-14 18:49:23	robdrake	so rusty writing, but I could give it a try
2018-12-14 18:49:49	robdrake	never completed English 101 in college
2018-12-14 18:53:53	robdrake	I haven't done any writing except for code since high school, graduated in '91
2018-12-14 18:54:22	robdrake	but I'll give it a shot, got a wish list of tutorials?
2018-12-14 18:55:50	absorto	Hey ppl! how are you doing ? Can someone tell me how to change from byobu to tmux as my default terminal multiplexer?
2018-12-14 18:56:48	robdrake	I haven't explored this system that far yet absorto, but check like .bashrc
2018-12-14 18:57:07	absorto	I saw how to disable byobu on the welcoming email
2018-12-14 18:57:46	absorto	good guess!
2018-12-14 18:58:17	robdrake	not a guess, I just know the purpose of .bash*
2018-12-14 18:58:32	@cmccabe	robdrake: even more important than english skill is just the step-by-step order of the tutorial.  all the tutorials are stored in a wiki, so others can help clean up the grammar and wording if you'd like.
2018-12-14 18:58:56	robdrake	ok, is the wish list in the wiki?
2018-12-14 18:59:05	robdrake	brb cigarette break
2018-12-14 19:00:36	@cmccabe	if there is a wishlist, it might be in cryptpad.  << paging ben >>
2018-12-14 19:01:04	@cmccabe	personally, i think an intro to command-line git for collaborative projects would be great.  and it could be a very short, simple tutorial.
2018-12-14 19:01:31	~ben	absorto: byobu is tmux
2018-12-14 19:01:59	~ben	(with ctrl-a instead of ctrl-b)
2018-12-14 19:02:18	~ben	cmccabe: robdrake i think the latest one that comes to mind would be a git tutorial
2018-12-14 19:04:31	absorto	~ben: Ahh! Great, it was the ctrl+a that I was missing then. Thank you for the headsup
2018-12-14 19:04:37	@cmccabe	ben, is there an RCS on ~team?
2018-12-14 19:04:58	~ben	np :)
2018-12-14 19:05:26	~ben	if you already have a heavily customized .tmux.conf, then i'd recommend switching from byobu to bare tmux
2018-12-14 19:05:36	~ben	at least for me, ctrl-a is a much nicer prefix
2018-12-14 19:05:41	~ben	cmccabe: RCS?
2018-12-14 19:05:47	@cmccabe	i was trying to think of how to implement a command line wiki, but realized that RCS might be it.
2018-12-14 19:05:54	absorto	Great, I will have a look
2018-12-14 19:06:18	~ben	Rich Communication Services?
2018-12-14 19:06:20	@cmccabe	RCS revision control system. simple directory of text files that users can check-in/check-out and modify
2018-12-14 19:06:33	~ben	git
2018-12-14 19:06:47	~ben	https://tildegit.org/team/site/src/branch/master/wiki
2018-12-14 19:06:52	~ben	just clone team/site
2018-12-14 19:06:56	~ben	edit wiki pages
2018-12-14 19:06:58	~ben	PR
2018-12-14 19:07:33	~ben	it's all markdown so it looks fine if you view the wiki pages locally too
2018-12-14 19:07:37	@cmccabe	that is for a web based wiki.
2018-12-14 19:07:51	@cmccabe	but i guess that could be any file type. so you're right
2018-12-14 19:08:13	~ben	i don't really want to have duplicate content
2018-12-14 19:08:48	~ben	unless you're thinking of other things that don't belong in the main wiki?
2018-12-14 19:09:27	@cmccabe	yes, just for internal documents.  but i was also thinking about pubnixes more generally. just thinking about what commandline-only tools are desired.
2018-12-14 19:10:45	robdrake	I'll do a basic git project setup later
2018-12-14 19:11:04	robdrake	no node references at all :P
2018-12-14 19:12:10	robdrake	now a question from me: how do I use my gopher hole? do I just put text file in pub_gopher, or whatever the dir is?
2018-12-14 19:13:03	robdrake	s/pub_gopher/public_gopher
2018-12-14 19:13:03	sedbot	<robdrake> now a question from me: how do I use my gopher hole? do I just put text file in public_gopher, or whatever the dir is?
2018-12-14 19:13:16	@cmccabe	yes, and make it public readable
2018-12-14 19:13:27	robdrake	thanks
2018-12-14 19:14:09	robdrake	my user name is rgdrake, what is the URI for the gopher hole, besides gopher://
2018-12-14 19:14:16	@cmccabe	sure.  happy tunneling. 
2018-12-14 19:14:42	~ben	gopher://tilde.team/0/~rgdrake
2018-12-14 19:15:14	~ben	if you're interested, i started some git documentation last year: https://benharri.github.io/learngit
2018-12-14 19:15:19	robdrake	thanks ben, I'll be putting the links for #solid in my gopher hole and my solid POD
2018-12-14 19:15:40	~ben	there's also a gopher proxy: https://gopher.tilde.team/tilde.team/
2018-12-14 19:15:53	robdrake	new content in #solid btw, how to use permissions
2018-12-14 19:16:10	~ben	cool
2018-12-14 19:16:37	~ben	khuxkm|lounge: can you think of a good way to exclude unchanged gopherholes from the list on gopher://tilde.team
2018-12-14 19:16:44	@cmccabe	gopher://tilde.team/1/~robdrake
2018-12-14 19:17:04	~ben	on https://tilde.team i compare the hash of index.php to the one in /etc/skel
2018-12-14 19:17:12	~ben	to skip default pages being listed
2018-12-14 19:17:27	~ben	i'd like to do that for gopher too
2018-12-14 19:17:33	@cmccabe	why not just nix public_gopher from skel so that people have to create it?
2018-12-14 19:17:59	~ben	too late
2018-12-14 19:18:08	~ben	there are already a bunch of users that have it
2018-12-14 19:18:25	@cmccabe	time machine, ben. time machine.
2018-12-14 19:19:07	~ben	hehe right
2018-12-14 19:19:19	~ben	lol yeah look at the list on there
2018-12-14 19:23:00	ubergeek	look at the ctime on the landing gophermap
2018-12-14 19:23:13	ubergeek	I think it keeps the one from skel
2018-12-14 19:23:49	ubergeek	or, compare ctime of gopermap to ctime of ~.  If they match, it's never been updated
2018-12-14 19:24:51	ubergeek	also a hash of the default gophermaps *should* work
2018-12-14 19:25:22	ubergeek	or rather compare mtime of gophermap to ctime of ~
2018-12-14 19:26:22	~ben	just found filecmp.cmp on SO
2018-12-14 19:26:24	~ben	trying it
2018-12-14 19:31:11	~ben	https://ttm.sh/Pc.txt
2018-12-14 19:31:15	~ben	why is it trying to compare
2018-12-14 19:31:20	~ben	a file that doesn't exist
2018-12-14 19:31:36	~ben	that line shouldn't even run 
2018-12-14 19:31:54	~ben	i'm so confused
2018-12-14 19:31:56	~ben	any ideas?
2018-12-14 19:31:57	jan6	lol
2018-12-14 19:32:18	jan6	why doesn't the html compare thingy work?
2018-12-14 19:32:31	M-l4p1n	nani ?
2018-12-14 19:32:40	~ben	wym jan6 ?
2018-12-14 19:32:45	~ben	M-l4p1n: what?
2018-12-14 19:32:57	M-l4p1n	ben: exactly what I'm saying :3 
2018-12-14 19:33:01	jan6	14:17:12           ~ben | to skip default pages being listed
2018-12-14 19:33:03	jan6	14:17:27           ~ben | i'd like to do that for gopher too
2018-12-14 19:33:12	~ben	yes 
2018-12-14 19:33:14	jan6	how're they different?
2018-12-14 19:33:19	~ben	what do you mean?
2018-12-14 19:33:31	jan6	I mean, why wouldn't you be able to use the html compare thingy for gopher?
2018-12-14 19:33:36	M-l4p1n	as usual, my Matrix server is flooding the logs :3
2018-12-14 19:33:40	~ben	cause the website is php 
2018-12-14 19:33:42	jan6	s/html/php
2018-12-14 19:33:42	sedbot	<jan6> I mean, why wouldn't you be able to use the php compare thingy for gopher?
2018-12-14 19:33:47	~ben	and the base gophermap is in python
2018-12-14 19:33:54	~ben	i just posted the base gohpermap
2018-12-14 19:34:01	~ben	M-l4p1n: how big is it now
2018-12-14 19:34:07	~ben	and can you set logs to expire?
2018-12-14 19:34:29	robdrake	ok, in my public_gopher is the files gophermap and the directory phlogs, is that normal?
2018-12-14 19:34:59	jan6	sure
2018-12-14 19:35:07	~ben	yeah
2018-12-14 19:35:28	jan6	gophermap is required, it's basiclly telling where stuff is, and what types they are (technically there are other types than just text)
2018-12-14 19:35:30	M-l4p1n	now about 2 GB with all logs added up  ben  
2018-12-14 19:35:41	~ben	ooofs
2018-12-14 19:35:46	~ben	that filled up quick
2018-12-14 19:35:58	jan6	phlogs is used by some script for gopher-blogging, basically, robdrake 
2018-12-14 19:36:52	robdrake	ok thanks jan6
2018-12-14 19:37:11	jan6	ben, if you don't find anything else, and want python, I guess you can get ideas from https://www.pythoncentral.io/finding-duplicate-files-with-python/ and modify it?
2018-12-14 19:37:23	~ben	i don't want python
2018-12-14 19:37:31	~ben	but that's what the gophermpa is
2018-12-14 19:38:16	jan6	gophermap itself is usually just text, you just want it to be fancy python, lol
2018-12-14 19:38:27	~ben	that's what it already is
2018-12-14 19:38:31	~ben	i'm just updating it
2018-12-14 19:39:27	~ben	i don't understand why the second if line is even getting called since the one before it is checking for the existence of ~/public_gopher
2018-12-14 19:39:33	~ben	https://ttm.sh/Pc.txt
2018-12-14 19:39:48	jan6	but still, if you don't figure out anything better you can list the dirs, and substract the ones that are "duplicates"
2018-12-14 19:40:02	~ben	why though
2018-12-14 19:40:08	~ben	that's unnecessary
2018-12-14 19:40:14	jan6	which line?
2018-12-14 19:40:31	jan6	(I guess it is, but as I said, IF you don't figure anything better)
2018-12-14 19:45:33	~ben	got it
2018-12-14 19:45:35	~ben	i think?
2018-12-14 19:46:52	~ben	why isn't it turning links into links????
2018-12-14 19:46:56	~ben	tomasino: ^
2018-12-14 19:46:58	~ben	any ideas?
2018-12-14 19:47:50	~ben	or anyone else?
2018-12-14 19:47:50	tomasino	hmm?
2018-12-14 19:47:56	~ben	see gopher://tilde.team
2018-12-14 19:48:25	tomasino	weird... it looks like it's displaying as type 0
2018-12-14 19:49:47	tomasino	are you using a shell script as your gophermap?
2018-12-14 19:52:24	~ben	yeah
2018-12-14 19:52:28	~ben	ok i figured it out
2018-12-14 19:52:35	~ben	accidentally ran :retab
2018-12-14 19:52:40	~ben	good to go now
2018-12-14 19:55:14	tomasino	oh whew
2018-12-14 19:56:57	~ben	that was Dumb
2018-12-14 20:03:20	tomasino	nope, i hit a wall with my make solution because make doesn't do spaces in filenames
2018-12-14 20:03:22	tomasino	that's dumb
2018-12-14 20:03:40	tomasino	soooooo close to everything working beautifully
2018-12-14 20:05:44	~ben	spaces don't belong in filenames
2018-12-14 20:05:46	~ben	lol
2018-12-14 20:09:15	tomasino	agreed!
2018-12-14 20:09:29	tomasino	stupid ships with spaces in them ruining my fun
2018-12-14 20:09:40	tomasino	gonna see if i can work around it through magic
2018-12-14 20:12:57	~ben	for some reason it really bothers me to see spaces in file/dir names :P
2018-12-14 20:20:02	@cmccabe	ben
2018-12-14 20:20:48	@cmccabe	fixed a misconfig in pisg, and still testing.  but new and periodically updated stats are now linked off my ~team page: https://tilde.team/~cmccabe/
2018-12-14 20:21:35	@cmccabe	after i finish testing, i will get it off my user directory and into a central place.
2018-12-14 20:23:07	~ben	woah nice
2018-12-14 20:23:25	~ben	you should check the SomeIRCNet and MAINTAINER 
2018-12-14 20:23:28	~ben	see if you can set that
2018-12-14 20:24:05	~ben	how long do they take to generate and are you going to cron them?
2018-12-14 20:24:11	~ben	generate on demand?
2018-12-14 20:25:10	@cmccabe	it is cron'ed right now. the 17th minute of every hour.
2018-12-14 20:25:18	~ben	ahh ok sounds good
2018-12-14 20:25:40	~ben	tilde is the most used word
2018-12-14 20:25:41	@cmccabe	they generate super fast. i should profile the run to see how much gas it takes.
2018-12-14 20:25:42	~ben	nice
2018-12-14 20:26:19	~ben	 Stats generated in 00 hours 00 minutes and 07 seconds 
2018-12-14 20:26:23	~ben	right at the bottom
2018-12-14 20:26:25	@cmccabe	oh
2018-12-14 20:26:29	@cmccabe	well, that answers the question
2018-12-14 20:27:02	~ben	oof i've been pinged 4581 times in #meta
2018-12-14 20:28:07	tomasino	ugh, yeah, not gonna work as long as ships have spaces in them
2018-12-14 20:28:09	tomasino	so dumb
2018-12-14 20:28:12	~ben	yuck
2018-12-14 20:28:19	@cmccabe	i need to add an ignore list to words, so words like "there" and "something" and "would" aren't included in the frequency list.
2018-12-14 20:28:34	~ben	makes sense
2018-12-14 20:29:35	tomasino	there's plenty of common stopword datafiles you can grab online
2018-12-14 20:30:36	tomasino	i don't see anything on https://tilde.team/~cmccabe/
2018-12-14 20:30:53	tomasino	oh, had to go to the link
2018-12-14 20:30:55	tomasino	i see
2018-12-14 20:31:29	tomasino	cmccabe: http://xpo6.com/list-of-english-stop-words/
2018-12-14 20:31:40	tomasino	i know R has nice libraries to handle these. not sure about php
2018-12-14 20:31:53	~ben	it's the pisg script so perl?
2018-12-14 20:45:45	@cmccabe	thanks tomasino. yeah, r has some great text analytics tools so it makes sense that's a place to look for stopwords.
2018-12-14 20:46:12	@cmccabe	i'm hoping i can just create a plaintext file of words and use those rather than something specific within a php file.

2018-12-15 00:06:19	tomasino	anyone built a cli tool for voting?
2018-12-15 00:06:25	tomasino	like, polls & such?
2018-12-15 00:13:14	~ben	i haven't 
2018-12-15 00:13:34	~ben	robdrake: ^ maybe a project since you were looking for seomthing earlier
2018-12-15 00:14:27	tomasino	i'd install it on cosmic if someone builds one
2018-12-15 00:14:29	tomasino	:)
2018-12-15 00:14:50	~ben	heh
2018-12-15 00:14:54	tomasino	also, ben, i'm running into some roadblocks trying to enable finger on cosmic to work externally
2018-12-15 00:15:01	~ben	lol 
2018-12-15 00:15:08	~ben	i was trying to do that the other day on ~team
2018-12-15 00:15:08	tomasino	i figured a ufw allowing port 79 and installing the daemon would do it, but apparently not
2018-12-15 00:15:14	tomasino	really? hah
2018-12-15 00:15:21	~ben	couldn't figure it out :P
2018-12-15 00:15:28	~ben	something something inetd misssing
2018-12-15 00:15:36	~ben	installed inetutils-inetd
2018-12-15 00:15:43	~ben	then tried xinetd
2018-12-15 00:15:46	tomasino	ooooh
2018-12-15 00:15:55	~ben	and various combinations of efingerd, fingerd, and cfingerd
2018-12-15 00:16:06	~ben	no dice
2018-12-15 00:16:16	tomasino	got it
2018-12-15 00:16:18	tomasino	apt-get install inetutils-inetd fingerd
2018-12-15 00:16:27	tomasino	plus ufw allow 79
2018-12-15 00:16:36	~ben	did it work?
2018-12-15 00:16:39	tomasino	yep
2018-12-15 00:16:41	~ben	oh shit
2018-12-15 00:16:43	tomasino	finger tomasino@cosmic.voyage
2018-12-15 00:16:43	~ben	nice
2018-12-15 00:16:55	~ben	oh nice
2018-12-15 00:17:08	tomasino	:D
2018-12-15 00:17:29	~ben	ok did that on ~team
2018-12-15 00:17:35	~ben	let's see if it worked
2018-12-15 00:18:00	tomasino	not yet
2018-12-15 00:18:02	tomasino	ufw?
2018-12-15 00:18:21	~ben	ufw allow 79 && ufw reload
2018-12-15 00:18:23	~ben	ye
2018-12-15 00:18:33	tomasino	huh, that's odd
2018-12-15 00:18:42	tomasino	i installed finger, then those two things
2018-12-15 00:18:44	tomasino	that's it
2018-12-15 00:18:54	~ben	already had finger
2018-12-15 00:19:04	tomasino	then i am confused! :D
2018-12-15 00:19:27	~ben	same
2018-12-15 00:19:31	~ben	:(
2018-12-15 00:20:18	tomasino	/etc/init.d/inetutils-inetd start
2018-12-15 00:20:57	fosslinux	wat does finger do
2018-12-15 00:21:19	tomasino	it shows some basic info about users, when they last logged in, checked mail, and their .plan files
2018-12-15 00:21:26	fosslinux	coool
2018-12-15 00:21:37	tomasino	it was one of the very early unix commands
2018-12-15 00:21:48	fosslinux	he
2018-12-15 00:21:50	fosslinux	unix ftw
2018-12-15 00:21:51	tomasino	https://blog.lundscape.com/2009/05/finger-daemon-on-ubuntu/
2018-12-15 00:22:10	fosslinux	dont you love it how 30 year old unix commands still exist today
2018-12-15 00:22:18	~ben	Dec 14 19:17:09 tilde inetd[3819]: fingerd/tcp: getaddrinfo: Servname not supported for ai_socktype
2018-12-15 00:22:20	~ben	huh
2018-12-15 00:22:27	tomasino	oh... that's new
2018-12-15 00:22:52	tomasino	restart fingerd?
2018-12-15 00:22:59	tomasino	maybe you needed ufw allow'd first?
2018-12-15 00:23:09	~ben	i just restarted it
2018-12-15 00:23:11	~ben	same thing
2018-12-15 00:23:11	tomasino	fosslinux: you can finger tomasino@sdf.org
2018-12-15 00:23:13	~ben	wtf
2018-12-15 00:23:37	~ben	or local users if you drop the hostname
2018-12-15 00:24:48	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-15 00:25:27	tomasino	well, you can successfully ssh tomasino@cosmic.voyage now
2018-12-15 00:25:33	tomasino	i'm sure ben will figure out team
2018-12-15 00:26:11	~ben	i'm still so confused why i'm getting that error
2018-12-15 00:26:37	~ben	tomasino: have you seen the mailing lists? :)
2018-12-15 00:27:03	tomasino	i've seen you talking about them
2018-12-15 00:27:26	@cmccabe	tomasino: by any chance did you just see my gopher post? or is it just a coincidence that you mentioned the voting thign?
2018-12-15 00:27:55	tomasino	cmccabe: my question was 100% influenced by your gopher post
2018-12-15 00:28:21	tomasino	and ben, how could i miss the 40 emails i've gotten? ;)
2018-12-15 00:28:37	~ben	lol
2018-12-15 00:28:50	@cmccabe	:)
2018-12-15 00:29:06	~ben	i finally figured out how to get the footer adjusted and i was feeling triumphant about that :D
2018-12-15 00:29:43	@cmccabe	tfurrows is planning a similar post. we thought it would be cool if we could inspire a bunch of gophernalists to write up their desired set of "pubnix core tools"
2018-12-15 00:30:00	~ben	ayyy i got it
2018-12-15 00:30:20	~ben	finger ben@tilde.team
2018-12-15 00:30:43	~ben	fingerd wasn't in /etc/services
2018-12-15 00:30:59	tomasino	oh weird
2018-12-15 00:31:07	tomasino	YAY! it worked
2018-12-15 00:31:56	tomasino	cmccabe: i think they're different for different systems, but having a library of portable pubnix focused tools would be super helpful
2018-12-15 00:32:05	tomasino	not a lot geared to multi-user single systems anymore
2018-12-15 00:32:38	@cmccabe	oh yeah, definitely different across systems.
2018-12-15 00:33:14	@cmccabe	finger searches on username as well as real name? e.g. ben brings up a bunch of other people who have ben as their first name.
2018-12-15 00:33:19	tomasino	ben, where's your PGP key and Project coming in?
2018-12-15 00:33:34	tomasino	apparently!
2018-12-15 00:33:44	~ben	heh yeah it does
2018-12-15 00:33:46	~ben	~/.plan
2018-12-15 00:33:58	~ben	and ~/.pgpkey
2018-12-15 00:34:26	~ben	oh and ~/.project
2018-12-15 00:34:43	@cmccabe	did you configure it to do .pgpkey or is that by default?
2018-12-15 00:35:08	tomasino	i wasn't aware af .pgpkey!
2018-12-15 00:35:10	tomasino	neat
2018-12-15 00:35:26	~ben	it's by default afict
2018-12-15 00:35:30	~ben	s/ic/aic
2018-12-15 00:35:30	sedbot	<ben> it's by default afaict

2018-12-15 00:39:15	tomasino	hmm, i can't find a conf file for it
2018-12-15 00:39:23	~ben	for finger?
2018-12-15 00:39:26	tomasino	yeah
2018-12-15 00:39:30	tomasino	wanna see if there's options
2018-12-15 00:39:32	~ben	i'm not aware of one lol
2018-12-15 00:40:01	~ben	man finger

2018-12-15 00:40:58	ubergeek_	experimenting, sorry for join/part spam :(
2018-12-15 00:41:10	@cmccabe	-m would be good, i think. 
2018-12-15 00:43:03	~ben	doesn't seem to work remotely though
2018-12-15 00:45:07	@cmccabe	finger doesn't?
2018-12-15 00:45:24	~ben	-m 
2018-12-15 00:47:30	@cmccabe	you can finger remote systems, but -m doesn't prevent remote fingerings (!) from searching other fields?
2018-12-15 00:47:55	tomasino	no clue at all where config for initd happens
2018-12-15 00:47:57	tomasino	hah
2018-12-15 00:48:01	tomasino	fingerd*
2018-12-15 00:49:50	~ben	yeah exactly cmccabe 
2018-12-15 00:49:59	~ben	/etc/inetd.conf
2018-12-15 00:50:07	~ben	oh fingred conf
2018-12-15 00:50:25	~ben	man in.fingerd
2018-12-15 00:50:39	tomasino	ahha
2018-12-15 00:51:06	tomasino	i have nothing in /etc/initd.conf
2018-12-15 00:51:10	~ben	you can put flags on the end of the line in inetd.conf
2018-12-15 00:51:17	~ben	what
2018-12-15 00:51:31	~ben	if you don't have anything in inetd.conf it shouldn't be working at all
2018-12-15 00:51:38	tomasino	inet*
2018-12-15 00:51:40	tomasino	derp
2018-12-15 00:51:42	tomasino	not init
2018-12-15 00:51:44	tomasino	haha
2018-12-15 00:52:02	~ben	lol were you looking in the wrong file? :P
2018-12-15 00:52:42	tomasino	yep!
2018-12-15 00:52:45	tomasino	spelled inet.d wrong
2018-12-15 00:52:47	tomasino	like a real winner
2018-12-15 00:52:52	~ben	killin' it :D
2018-12-15 00:53:00	~ben	wow i feel so successful today!
2018-12-15 00:53:09	~ben	fingerd sorted
2018-12-15 00:53:14	~ben	and mailing list footers!
2018-12-15 00:53:22	tomasino	now, how to restart it
2018-12-15 00:54:00	~ben	inetd spins up the corresponding process when a matching request comes in
2018-12-15 00:54:17	tomasino	nice
2018-12-15 00:54:23	~ben	probably sudo service inetutils-inetd restart
2018-12-15 00:54:33	~ben	if it doesn't just work
2018-12-15 00:54:34	tomasino	/etc/init.d/inetutils-inetd restart
2018-12-15 00:54:37	tomasino	did the trick
2018-12-15 00:54:38	~ben	same thing
2018-12-15 00:54:56	~ben	i'm used to using service
2018-12-15 00:55:01	~ben	it works for systemd units too
2018-12-15 00:55:56	tomasino	oh yeah, you might want to add "-u" ben
2018-12-15 00:55:59	tomasino	finger @tilde.team
2018-12-15 00:56:04	~ben	-u?
2018-12-15 00:56:11	tomasino	don't allow @tilde.team without usernames
2018-12-15 00:56:20	~ben	oh
2018-12-15 00:56:38	~ben	yeah that's probably not great
2018-12-15 00:57:03	~ben	done
2018-12-15 00:57:10	tomasino	nice
2018-12-15 00:57:26	~ben	definitely a better idea
2018-12-15 00:57:30	tomasino	i wonder if you can customize the welcome message
2018-12-15 00:58:13	~ben	doesn't look like it
2018-12-15 00:58:17	tomasino	sdf has their fingerd really customized
2018-12-15 00:58:21	tomasino	i gotta look into that
2018-12-15 00:58:29	tomasino	like, can i just run a shell script?
2018-12-15 00:59:12	~ben	not sure
2018-12-15 00:59:22	~ben	we've reached the edge of my fingerd knowledge
2018-12-15 00:59:31	tomasino	http://www.weird.com/~woods/projects/fingerd.html
2018-12-15 00:59:41	tomasino	this is for netbsd, but i wonder if it'll work
2018-12-15 01:00:04	tomasino	even this is 20 years old
2018-12-15 01:00:58	~ben	lol it might be the same version
2018-12-15 01:01:38	fosslinux	`def could be
2018-12-15 01:02:31	tomasino	https://www.gnu.org/software//finger/manual/html_mono/finger.html
2018-12-15 01:02:35	tomasino	gnu finger

2018-12-15 01:03:07	~ben	nice
2018-12-15 01:03:10	fosslinux	i have a programming idea coming on
2018-12-15 01:03:15	tomasino	hah, yep
2018-12-15 01:03:24	tomasino	well, good enough for now
2018-12-15 01:03:25	fosslinux	a script that checkes my mail on all of my tidles
2018-12-15 01:03:29	~ben	or
2018-12-15 01:03:34	tomasino	i'd like to customize it one day
2018-12-15 01:03:38	~ben	you could just echo mainemail > ~/.forward
2018-12-15 01:03:45	fosslinux	so i dont have to log onto each one individually
2018-12-15 01:03:52	fosslinux	that doesen't work on all tildes ben
2018-12-15 01:03:56	~ben	wot

2018-12-15 01:04:31	tomasino	works on any with outbound mail
2018-12-15 01:04:59	fosslinux	okey dokie
2018-12-15 01:05:26	~ben	far less complex than writing your own mailchecker
2018-12-15 01:05:28	fosslinux	id bettter do that on cosmic, your, institute, 
2018-12-15 01:06:10	~ben	heh as you wish :)

2018-12-15 01:29:26	ubergeek	p/whois hexahaxtron1
2018-12-15 01:29:33	~ben	is tomasino.com premium?
2018-12-15 01:29:40	~ben	benharri is my testing account
2018-12-15 01:29:46	~ben	to test out the default configs
2018-12-15 01:29:57	ubergeek	I hate "premium" domain names...
2018-12-15 01:30:01	~ben	so dum
2018-12-15 01:30:13	tomasino	it's squatted
2018-12-15 01:30:14	ubergeek	They don't cost anymore to create.  The whole DNS registry thing really gets under my skin
2018-12-15 01:30:22	tomasino	last i checked they wanted 8k
2018-12-15 01:30:25	~ben	oh jeez
2018-12-15 01:30:26	ubergeek	smh
2018-12-15 01:30:29	fosslinux	omf
2018-12-15 01:30:31	~ben	tomasino.org is better imo
2018-12-15 01:30:50	~ben	if you can't tell i like .org
2018-12-15 01:30:51	fosslinux	i <3 fosslinux as a name
2018-12-15 01:30:57	ubergeek	I prefer .nets
2018-12-15 01:30:59	tomasino	i appreciate verisign not controlling my life
2018-12-15 01:30:59	fosslinux	because its never
2018-12-15 01:31:01	fosslinux	used
2018-12-15 01:31:08	~ben	.net is solid too
2018-12-15 01:31:13	fosslinux	minecraft.net
2018-12-15 01:31:25	~ben	dotnet.net
2018-12-15 01:31:39	ubergeek	net.dotnet.net
2018-12-15 01:31:47	tomasino	verisign owns .net
2018-12-15 01:31:55	~ben	oh do they?
2018-12-15 01:31:55	tomasino	screw them
2018-12-15 01:32:01	tomasino	.com and .net both
2018-12-15 01:32:06	tomasino	but not .org
2018-12-15 01:32:08	fosslinux	and .com ??!!
2018-12-15 01:32:14	~ben	who has .org?
2018-12-15 01:32:16	ubergeek	Not .tilde, though :P
2018-12-15 01:32:16	tomasino	that's owned by a nonprofit in reston va
2018-12-15 01:32:27	tomasino	verisign operates .gov as well
2018-12-15 01:32:51	ubergeek	;/
2018-12-15 01:32:57	ubergeek	I don't think that is accurate...
2018-12-15 01:33:27	ubergeek	but, if true...  Not wholly shocking that a private corporation owns the government lol
2018-12-15 01:33:55	~ben	not at all tbh
2018-12-15 01:35:22	tomasino	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains
2018-12-15 01:35:26	tomasino	it's near the top
2018-12-15 01:35:29	tomasino	they also run .edu
2018-12-15 01:36:14	tomasino	they run .cc
2018-12-15 01:36:19	tomasino	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign
2018-12-15 01:36:33	tomasino	and .tv and .jobs
2018-12-15 01:37:09	tomasino	ICANN forced them to give up .org in 2003
2018-12-15 01:37:53	tomasino	.net was supposed to stop being theirs in 2017, but i have no idea what happened
2018-12-15 01:39:14	~ben	oh wow
2018-12-15 01:40:08	tomasino	i don't care for them
2018-12-15 01:41:19	~ben	yeah no thanks
2018-12-15 01:49:48	ubergeek	They probably just refused to give it up
2018-12-15 01:49:57	ubergeek	It's not like ICANN has any real enforcement power, tbh
2018-12-15 03:00:04	@cmccabe	ben, i missed some of the finger conversation. are you trying to get that set up among tildeverse systems? or for anywhere with finger installed?
2018-12-15 03:00:28	<--	ubergeek_ (ubergeek@0::1) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
2018-12-15 03:00:32	~ben	that sounds like something that could end up as a tildeverse rfc
2018-12-15 03:00:58	~ben	tomasino and i were talking about getting it set up as a daemon to accept external finger requests (eg user@tilde.team)
2018-12-15 03:01:06	@cmccabe	i recall vilibm was interested in finger, if security concerns could be worked out.
2018-12-15 03:01:14	~ben	i hadn't had any luck the last time i tried to get it going
2018-12-15 03:01:17	~ben	but it's working now
2018-12-15 03:01:27	~ben	so you should be able to do finger cmccabe@tilde.team etc
2018-12-15 03:01:38	~ben	cmccabe: what security concerns?
2018-12-15 03:01:44	@cmccabe	from otuside?
2018-12-15 03:01:59	~ben	ah that's right, ~town doesn't like anything external
2018-12-15 03:02:01	@cmccabe	maybe privacy, not security
2018-12-15 03:02:14	~ben	i added the -u flag to prevent it listing all users at least
2018-12-15 03:02:24	~ben	finger @tilde.team returns a list of all users without it
2018-12-15 03:02:42	@cmccabe	so i should be able to finger ~team from sdf, for example?
2018-12-15 03:02:46	~ben	yup
2018-12-15 03:03:08	~ben	should work from pretty much anywhere
2018-12-15 03:03:20	~ben	in much the same way that you can finger cmccabe@sdf.org from anywhere
2018-12-15 03:03:28	@cmccabe	lemme try. back in a segundo.
2018-12-15 03:05:13	@cmccabe	craziness. reminds me of the 1990's 
2018-12-15 03:05:24	~ben	pretty great isn't it? :D
2018-12-15 03:05:27	~ben	oh btw
2018-12-15 03:05:36	@cmccabe	it is cool.
2018-12-15 03:05:38	~ben	you should change the css link on your public_html/index
2018-12-15 03:06:00	@cmccabe	i wonder if people would wanted it limited to tildeverse federated systems though
2018-12-15 03:06:05	~ben	breaks on subdomains, so use the full url (prepending https://tilde.team)
2018-12-15 03:06:24	~ben	that would involve some firewall fuckery
2018-12-15 03:06:38	~ben	not worth it imo
2018-12-15 03:06:46	~ben	but doable
2018-12-15 03:07:46	@cmccabe	there is some discussion of whitelisted emails among some federated pubnix systems. i suspect firewall fuckery skills will be a topic of discussion more and more.
2018-12-15 03:08:07	~ben	that would be super cool
2018-12-15 03:08:14	~ben	get ~town to be a little bit more open
2018-12-15 03:08:26	ahriman	finger on team now eh?
2018-12-15 03:08:32	~ben	yessir!
2018-12-15 03:10:44	ahriman	will there be some sort of standard for services provided on tildes, like finger? because I'm down to follow a standard if uniform services provided by each tilde will help our cause
2018-12-15 03:10:57	fosslinux	^
2018-12-15 03:11:01	@cmccabe	ahriman: are you running a tilde too?
2018-12-15 03:11:09	fosslinux	tilde.institute
2018-12-15 03:11:21	ahriman	Yep!
2018-12-15 03:11:36	ahriman	It's in its infancy
2018-12-15 03:11:39	~ben	ahriman: i'm thinking we can get a draft going on https://rfc.tildeverse.org
2018-12-15 03:11:56	ahriman	Cool, I'll check it out when I get home
2018-12-15 03:12:05	@cmccabe	tilde.institute is yours, ahriman? or yours, fosslinux?
2018-12-15 03:12:10	ahriman	Mine
2018-12-15 03:12:16	~ben	openbsd!
2018-12-15 03:12:28	@cmccabe	slick website!
2018-12-15 03:12:28	~ben	cmccabe: were you around when i stood up https://bsd.tilde.team
2018-12-15 03:12:38	ahriman	Thanks cmccabe
2018-12-15 03:12:41	~ben	oh yeah tilde.institute has a fantastic site :)
2018-12-15 03:12:48	fosslinux	sure does
2018-12-15 03:13:09	@cmccabe	yes, but i haven't logged in.  i thought it was supposed to use the same keys as for ~team, but it doesn't let me in.
2018-12-15 03:13:15	fosslinux	hmm
2018-12-15 03:13:20	~ben	yeah it should have the same keys
2018-12-15 03:13:46	~ben	i copied over everyone's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
2018-12-15 03:13:50	@cmccabe	just ssh to bsd.tilde.team, right?
2018-12-15 03:13:52	~ben	yup
2018-12-15 03:13:55	~ben	shoudl do id
2018-12-15 03:13:56	@cmccabe	hmm
2018-12-15 03:14:05	fosslinux	ben: in the makeuser script does something copy over keys?
2018-12-15 03:14:21	~ben	fosslinux: no but i should add that
2018-12-15 03:14:27	@cmccabe	Permission denied (publickey).
2018-12-15 03:14:39	~ben	um
2018-12-15 03:15:32	~ben	wtf you don't have a homedir
2018-12-15 03:15:34	~ben	one moment
2018-12-15 03:19:20	~ben	ok try now cmccabe 
2018-12-15 03:22:49	@cmccabe	nice. that worked.
2018-12-15 03:24:25	~ben	not sure why your homedir didn't exist
2018-12-15 03:24:32	~ben	but it's up now
2018-12-15 03:24:42	@cmccabe	i only logged in and out quickly. didn't look around. what kind of bsd is it packing?
2018-12-15 03:24:55	~ben	freebsd
2018-12-15 03:25:08	~ben	you should have the same group membership as on ~team proper
2018-12-15 03:25:11	@cmccabe	oh nice. so there's some variety. institute is openbsd, right?
2018-12-15 03:25:17	~ben	yeah that's right
2018-12-15 03:25:49	@cmccabe	i tried running a freebsd desktop around 15 years ago. that experiment didn't last long.
2018-12-15 03:26:14	~ben	i was looking into running a bsd on my laptop a couple months ago but the hardware support was terrible (mostly wifi)
2018-12-15 03:26:46	@cmccabe	who needs wifi. it's only good for internet really.
2018-12-15 03:27:21	~ben	i don't even have the ethernet adapter for my laptop lol
2018-12-15 03:27:55	~ben	debian works fine but i need the non-free firmware blob
2018-12-15 03:27:59	~ben	oh well
2018-12-15 03:47:12	ahriman	i had to get a nonfree firmware blob for my laptop when i slapped debian on it
2018-12-15 03:47:26	fosslinux	ew
2018-12-15 03:52:52	~ben	yup :(
2018-12-15 03:53:02	~ben	ahriman: how do i check what firewall is running on freebsd
2018-12-15 03:53:21	~ben	i'm seeing an incoming mail from ~team getting connection refused to bsd.tilde.team
2018-12-15 03:56:48	ahriman	you'll have to check /etc/rc.conf, depending on what you have: ipfilter_enable firewall_enable or pf_enable

2018-12-15 03:58:54	ahriman	with freebsd one of the three must be explicitly enabled somewhere

2018-12-15 03:59:41	ahriman	yeah mail is not my strong suit, unfortunately. i'd check netstat -ant to see where it's listening

2018-12-15 04:38:41	ahriman	word can be a term of agreement, like "okay"

2018-12-15 04:39:03	~ben	:ok_hand:
2018-12-15 04:39:09	ahriman	which is how i usually use it

2018-12-15 04:39:36	ahriman	lol
2018-12-15 04:40:18	~ben	bird

2018-12-15 04:44:05	ahriman	oh god
2018-12-15 04:44:14	ahriman	now that's going to be stuck in my head
2018-12-15 04:45:02	slipyx	papa oo ma mow mow
2018-12-15 04:46:06	~ben	lol
2018-12-15 04:52:14	~ben	oh wow bsd.tilde.team gets 9/10 on mail-tester: https://www.mail-tester.com/test-yprhl
2018-12-15 04:52:28	~ben	just a couple dns records and bang
2018-12-15 04:53:24	ahriman	hell yes!
2018-12-15 04:53:39	~ben	dkim isn't worth the 1 point
2018-12-15 05:07:55	ahriman	im doing mail-tester for my stuff, didn't know about it before
2018-12-15 05:08:08	ahriman	tis saying my ip fails spf validation but my ip is in my spf record, weird.
2018-12-15 05:12:52	~ben	hmmmst
2018-12-15 05:13:01	~ben	does it give full details
2018-12-15 05:14:58	ahriman	yeah it's saying i don't have an spf record. on cloudflare it's under an "spf" category, however I've traditionally always implemented spf in a TXT record so I just duplicated it
2018-12-15 05:15:29	ahriman	now it says i cant test more than three times a day, so i'll put it off until tomorrow. 8/10 before the spf fix is good enough i suppose
2018-12-15 05:17:04	~ben	oh i always just put it as txt under the root 
2018-12-15 05:17:22	~ben	i didn't know there was an spf record type lol
2018-12-15 05:17:26	ahriman	yeah i switched it to TXT. i didn't notice it was set as a specific "spf" category before
2018-12-15 05:17:47	ahriman	when i was working at the web host i must have done 1,000s of people's dns records for mail and it was always txt
2018-12-15 05:18:01	~ben	uuf lots of mail records
2018-12-15 05:18:19	~ben	do the bsds use opendkim
2018-12-15 05:18:26	~ben	or is there a different dkim milter
2018-12-15 05:18:28	ahriman	i've never used it tbh
2018-12-15 05:18:38	ahriman	i'll check if it's available
2018-12-15 05:18:45	~ben	that's what i use on team
2018-12-15 05:19:02	ahriman	opendkim is available on openbsd
2018-12-15 05:19:14	~ben	ok cool
2018-12-15 05:19:21	~ben	it's pretty straightforward
2018-12-15 05:19:34	ahriman	ill have to implement it

2018-12-15 10:10:16	robdrake	I'll have to think about how to implement a voting application
2018-12-15 12:15:10	@cmccabe	robdrake: do you already have ideas about the language or tools you'll use to build it?
2018-12-15 13:06:05	robdrake	language, javascript, I know node best
2018-12-15 13:06:20	robdrake	cmccabe: ^
2018-12-15 13:07:34	robdrake	have it ran locally on tilde.team, count a user's vote by their account name
2018-12-15 13:07:59	robdrake	to try and cut down on cheating
2018-12-15 13:08:12	@cmccabe	all CLI based? or web UI too?
2018-12-15 13:08:24	robdrake	I've been thinking about this program, kind of on back burner
2018-12-15 13:09:15	robdrake	cli
2018-12-15 13:09:25	@cmccabe	then i like it
2018-12-15 13:09:27	@cmccabe	:)
2018-12-15 13:09:58	robdrake	use json to set up the vote questions and options
2018-12-15 13:22:26	@cmccabe	one thing to consider is if it could be written in such a way that it could be called from within other programs, like bbses. for example, it would be neat to have voting options within bbj.
2018-12-15 13:23:49	robdrake	it'll just use stdin and stdout
2018-12-15 13:23:56	robdrake	with a config file
2018-12-15 13:24:32	robdrake	some one can alway fork / do a pull request
2018-12-15 13:41:39	robdrake	which is more | friendly, requiring the return / enter key to be pressed, or just getting the raw key itself?
2018-12-15 13:58:36	jan6	have an option for both?
2018-12-15 14:00:12	jan6	you can always `echo "1"` to input "1\n", and `echo -e "1\n"` to simulate hitting enter twice, etc
2018-12-15 14:01:04	jan6	so whichever option enables that by default, should be default imo
2018-12-15 14:02:17	jan6	echo -e "1\n4\n1\nYes"|poll 2
2018-12-15 14:03:08	jan6	echo -e "1\n4\n1\nYes"|poll 2;poll --results 2 >/tmp/poll-2-res.txt
2018-12-15 14:14:25	robdrake	I may do an option for both, I just looked up Bulletin Butter & Jelly, me doing the program in Python will slow down dev time, but I could be convinced to use python
2018-12-15 14:23:48	@cmccabe	is bbj python?
2018-12-15 14:24:03	robdrake	yep
2018-12-15 14:24:49	@cmccabe	some day, for practice, i plan to re-write a bunch of these tools in bash.

2018-12-16 12:48:30	jan6	I definitely would prefer a "digest mode" over constant bombardment of mail

2018-12-16 14:29:42	erxeto	not sure 36 emails in 2 days is qualified as a "constant bombardment" (at least for a mailing list, this one is really low volume now), but you can activate digest mode easily. Maybe we should put some wiki help pages for it ...
2018-12-16 14:32:20	jan6	put 'em pages

2018-12-16 18:49:01	jan6	yeah, but what's the difference between plaintext and summary?
2018-12-16 18:49:31	~ben	hm?
2018-12-16 18:50:34	jan6	"If you select summary digests , you'll get posts bundled together (usually one per day but possibly more on busy lists), instead of singly when they're sent. Your mail reader may or may not support MIME digests. In general MIME digests are preferred, but if you have a problem reading them, select plain text digests."
2018-12-16 18:50:50	~ben	oh there ya go

2018-12-16 18:51:13	jan6	there are three digest options and it doesn

2018-12-16 18:52:43	jan6	it acts as if you had to choose mime/plaintext, but never states any difference from the "summary" mode

2018-12-16 19:36:01	~ben	yeah multiple choice is fine

2018-12-17 12:52:13	ubergeek	I feel most pubnixes each have their own individual "flavor"
2018-12-17 12:53:47	@cmccabe	definitely
2018-12-17 12:54:08	@cmccabe	and some are older and need fresh blood, like grex
2018-12-17 12:56:29	arne	i hate sdf :)
2018-12-17 12:58:30	@cmccabe	really? why?
2018-12-17 13:02:40	robdrake	I don't like the donation wall of sdf
2018-12-17 13:06:19	@cmccabe	ah
2018-12-17 13:07:14	robdrake	asking for donations is fine, but sdf's wall is too restrictive, and f'ing annoying

2018-12-17 13:39:48	robdrake	don't remember
2018-12-17 13:40:02	robdrake	I am going to nap and think until breakfast gets here
2018-12-17 13:40:20	jan6	also nothing wrong with a morning nap if you don't have an enforced schedule (school/work/stuff like that)
2018-12-17 13:40:36	robdrake	I sleep vs program too much lateley, else I'm on IRC too much

2018-12-17 13:41:30	jan6	I've also began to sleep too little recently, not too little to cause problems but, 1am instead of like 11-12 previously, so a few hours less sleep

2018-12-17 15:47:59	~ben	yep on that 9 to 5 hustle
2018-12-17 15:48:05	@cmccabe	yup. picture ben and cmccabe in cubicles next to each other. except that we're in different states. and not in cubicles.
2018-12-17 15:48:14	~ben	lmao sounds about right :P
2018-12-17 15:48:39	jan6	why not 5 to 11 hustle? ;P

2018-12-17 16:44:39	robdrake	jack3 it's more my idea
2018-12-17 16:44:58	robdrake	instead of command line voting, an irc vote bot
2018-12-17 16:45:08	jack3	describe what it would do
2018-12-17 16:45:41	robdrake	ben?
2018-12-17 16:45:49	~ben	huh?
2018-12-17 16:45:53	robdrake	or is this my ballgame?
2018-12-17 16:45:56	~ben	i thought you were making the bot
2018-12-17 16:46:06	robdrake	cli, yes, not irc
2018-12-17 16:47:03	~ben	i mean it could do whatever you want

2018-12-17 16:50:56	~ben	heh okie
2018-12-17 17:17:01	@cmccabe	i like CLI, but if there is an interface allowing it to be used via IRC, that would be a nice addition.
2018-12-17 17:20:07	jan6	it's not hard to make cli work for irc
2018-12-17 17:20:44	jan6	a) using ii b) just modify bashbot, and yes, it's a bot made IN bash, executing stuff from bash
2018-12-17 17:23:23	@cmccabe	bash is tops in my book. although it's tied with a number of others for that top spot.
2018-12-17 17:39:55	jan6	then take a look at bashbot and see if you can make `head`s or `tail`s of it ;P

2018-12-19 17:58:24	~ben	hey mijk !!
2018-12-19 17:58:28	~ben	welcome to tilde.team!
2018-12-19 18:00:10	mijk	Goodevening ben! :) Thanks for letting me join in the fun. 
2018-12-19 18:00:16	~ben	glad to have you!
2018-12-19 18:00:37	~ben	check out the wiki: https://tilde.team/wiki/ 
2018-12-19 18:00:38	cirno	[tilde.team~wiki]
2018-12-19 18:00:42	~ben	and holler if you need anything :D
2018-12-19 18:01:08	mijk	Wow this is super cool, straight in and all this at my fingertips pre-configured 
2018-12-19 18:01:34	~ben	heh that's the idea
2018-12-19 18:01:49	~ben	if you're familiar with tmux, just use ctrl-a instead of ctrl-b
2018-12-19 18:02:38	mijk	I did use tmux, so should have no greta difficulty i hope 
2018-12-19 18:02:52	~ben	heh ok good deal
2018-12-19 18:03:25	~ben	main communication is here on irc and also our mailing list
2018-12-19 18:03:42	~ben	should be subscribed as part of the signup script we use
2018-12-19 18:04:20	mijk	saying that, i am no Geek#1 really, but i have played around a little.
2018-12-19 18:05:01	~ben	enought to get around ;)
2018-12-19 18:05:09	mijk	cool! it's a good idea, imo having a central place to come and chat 
2018-12-19 18:05:36	~ben	yeah, this irc net is part connected with a couple other tilde servers too
2018-12-19 18:05:41	~ben	https://tildeverse.org/members/
2018-12-19 18:05:43	cirno	[tildeverse]
2018-12-19 18:06:54	mijk	I know another system where each room of the bbs is,or can be, a xmpp channel, and although they have a 'lobby' there is no central place for real time chat that everybody uses outside of the traditional bbs (its a modren bbs though, but with traditional values :) )
2018-12-19 18:07:26	~ben	oh that's cool too!
2018-12-19 18:07:41	~ben	try bbj at the shell :P
2018-12-19 18:07:48	mijk	yeah xmpp is alive and well still
2018-12-19 18:08:28	~ben	so is irc!
2018-12-19 18:08:47	mijk	bbj - yeah i was curious to see your bbs system :) Have you had a look at the bbs on grex? 
2018-12-19 18:09:15	~ben	oh no i haven't yet
2018-12-19 18:09:19	mijk	although 'i' havn't been on irc for a little while, i am sure that was in no doubt :) 
2018-12-19 18:10:10	mijk	it's a clone (more features i think) of picospan, the system that "The Well" used (and still does i think)
2018-12-19 18:10:13	~ben	grex is very laggy for me
2018-12-19 18:10:44	mijk	yes it is a bit for me too.
2018-12-19 18:11:06	~ben	i hope you're getting a nice ping to here
2018-12-19 18:11:14	~ben	(since the server is located in germany)
2018-12-19 18:11:19	~ben	quite a bit closer than i am
2018-12-19 18:11:34	ahriman	i just pinged em, 500+ms
2018-12-19 18:12:01	mijk	Thanks for the warm welcome Ben, i'll check out bbj now ( yeah Deutchland right? :)  )
2018-12-19 18:12:19	ahriman	hola mijk 
2018-12-19 18:14:31	~ben	oof that's a huge ping
2018-12-19 18:14:33	~ben	yeap!
2018-12-19 18:14:35	~ben	:)
2018-12-19 18:15:22	mijk	G'Day ahriman! 
2018-12-19 18:15:50	mijk	i had an average of 50 ms, does that sound right? :)
2018-12-19 18:16:14	@cmccabe	hey mijk! i recognize you!
2018-12-19 18:17:07	mijk	Hey! Eeeeh! <backslapping-and Italian accents...> 
2018-12-19 18:17:14	mijk	:D 
2018-12-19 18:17:53	mijk	Hi cmccabe! 
2018-12-19 18:19:05	~ben	yeah that sounds about right
2018-12-19 18:19:10	~ben	i get 120-130ms
2018-12-19 18:20:09	~ben	but 500ms to grex is ridiculous since it's in michigan!
2018-12-19 18:20:15	~ben	i'm only a few hundred miles away
2018-12-19 18:20:26	ahriman	yeah that's insane
2018-12-19 18:22:02	mijk	i was pinging tilde.team, grex was on average 500+ for me too
2018-12-19 18:23:04	mijk	cmccabe: i was never good at disguises :) 
2018-12-19 18:23:14	ahriman	https://bin.tilde.team/kiul
2018-12-19 18:23:35	~ben	yeah that's about what i get
2018-12-19 18:23:42	~ben	from my pi at home and my vps in dallas
2018-12-19 18:23:51	~ben	to grex that is
2018-12-19 18:26:02	ahriman	ben: i tried out fish on ~inst, and it's amazing compared to ksh
2018-12-19 18:26:24	ahriman	the history suggestions and autocompletion are <3
2018-12-19 18:26:29	~ben	i know they're fricken nuts
2018-12-19 18:26:36	~ben	:D
2018-12-19 18:26:49	~ben	plus i love that it colors in the command name when it exists in $PATH
2018-12-19 18:26:57	ahriman	yeah thats nice too
2018-12-19 18:27:25	mijk	bj looks pretty amazing too :) Anything with vi keybindings has my approval too.  What is the relationship between the bbj text bbs and the web version?
2018-12-19 18:28:57	~ben	https://bbj.tilde.team is a read-only viewer
2018-12-19 18:28:59	cirno	[~team BBJ]
2018-12-19 18:29:10	~ben	the terminal client is the only actual client
2018-12-19 18:33:48	mijk	Ahh i see. That actually makes perfect sense. The action/replies are here on tilde.team, and not on the web: so it's kind like reading the news, and here we can debate (?) 
2018-12-19 18:34:22	~ben	yeah something like that
2018-12-19 18:34:32	~ben	though irc is the place that sees the most activity
2018-12-19 18:34:41	jan6|	^
2018-12-19 18:34:49	~ben	mailing list is relatively new but already picking up a bit of chatter
2018-12-19 18:35:09	mijk	But it's good to have a permanent record, like a forum/bbs
2018-12-19 18:35:16	~ben	feel free to update your subscribed address or forward your ~team mail somewhere else
2018-12-19 18:35:22	~ben	https://lists.tildeverse.org/
2018-12-19 18:35:23	mijk	... and mailing lists :)
2018-12-19 18:35:25	cirno	[
2018-12-19 18:35:31	~ben	mailing lists are awesome
2018-12-19 18:35:40	ahriman	i <3 mailing lists
2018-12-19 18:35:44	~ben	i'll try to post updates there and also on the ~team homepage
2018-12-19 18:35:51	~ben	in the news section
2018-12-19 18:36:17	jan6	why not have a script mirror the news instead?
2018-12-19 18:36:25	~ben	from?
2018-12-19 18:36:33	jan6	either side
2018-12-19 18:36:58	jan6	easier from page -> mail, I'd assume, but doesn't matter which way exactly imo
2018-12-19 18:37:30	~ben	ehh i might not want to put the same content on both places

2018-12-19 23:24:45	~ben	it's a vps from ovh
2018-12-19 23:24:53	~ben	redundancy ya know

2018-12-19 23:26:09	fosslinux	redundancy ftw
2018-12-19 23:26:23	~ben	so the idea is to prevent ~team from being the SPOF
2018-12-19 23:26:39	~ben	if you get us locked out for portscanning or something ;)
