2018-12-02 02:13:56	ubergeek	.tilde dns servers are: Frankfurt: 139.59.215.24 | Quebec: 149.56.184.112 | Seattle: 66.42.77.29 | Atlanta: 144.202.23.174
2018-12-02 02:14:02	fosslinux	i didn't see that
2018-12-02 02:14:04	fosslinux	OHHH
2018-12-02 02:14:05	ubergeek	ah
2018-12-02 02:14:09	fosslinux	it was TildeBot
2018-12-02 02:14:15	ubergeek	yep ;)
2018-12-02 02:14:18	fosslinux	i have TildeBot ignored
2018-12-02 02:14:24	ubergeek	that would do it
2018-12-02 02:14:31	fosslinux	:P
2018-12-02 02:14:45	ubergeek	They are also updated in the wiki page on the gitea repo
2018-12-02 02:15:38	fosslinux	shouldnt this line in "Setting up a .tilde DNS Server"

2018-12-02 02:16:09	ubergeek	those need to be fixed, thanks for pointing it out
2018-12-02 02:17:04	ubergeek	although, it shoudl still work.  after I moved the repo, I forked it
2018-12-02 02:17:24	ubergeek	Just to keep things flowing correctly, as a cron job is required to refresh the zones for all of the masters
2018-12-02 02:17:54	ubergeek	I also run an in-house DNS server for .tilde, at home.  Just not published as it's a ittle container on my homelab
2018-12-02 02:24:56	 *	ubergeek is considering adding a ".verse" TLD as well

2018-12-02 02:36:44	ubergeek	I thought so, since a lot of people refer to "the 'verse", and it might possible garner interest from other federated services

2018-12-04 02:05:23	~ubergeek	If you want, you can point your zone to name servers you run.  Or, you can do a PR with the new zone file for thunix

2018-12-04 02:09:24	~ubergeek	But to do a PR, you fork the repo, make the changes in your fork, then attempt a merge into the master.  It'll ask you if you want to create a PR automatically.

2018-12-04 19:09:26	ben	i can look into it
2018-12-04 23:27:47	Naglfar	ubergeek, is it possible some like update cache from DNS servers ?
2018-12-05 00:01:04	Naglfar	anyway it seems not to be the cause
2018-12-05 01:01:50	~ubergeek	I don't think it's a caching issue.  the ns's are just forwarding off to your servers.  digs against your servers manually seem to work fine, and it seems to work fine from my dev box.
2018-12-05 01:02:04	~ubergeek	And bind has been reloaded myriad times
2018-12-05 01:02:42	~ubergeek	I'm going to rebuild my dev box again, and see if I can duplicate the issue there

2018-12-09 01:13:50	hyperboredoubt	I don't get how DNS works, even after skimming the comic. It seems like too many steps for something that should be much simpler.
2018-12-09 01:14:07	~ubergeek	It used to be a bit more complicated, tbh
2018-12-09 01:14:18	hyperboredoubt	D:
2018-12-09 01:14:19	~ubergeek	Every machine had their own file listing all servers...
2018-12-09 01:14:31	~ubergeek	... and that was shared around to all server admins.
2018-12-09 01:14:51	~ubergeek	Needless to say, it became, shall we say, "Unscalable" :P
2018-12-09 01:15:51	hyperboredoubt	Maybe it never should have been scalable? Maybe capitalism pushes us to exponential growth for no benefit to us as people but only to those who would use our tools to amass power and wealth?
2018-12-09 01:21:37	~ubergeek	Well, that is one case where I think it should scale...
2018-12-09 01:21:56	~ubergeek	Where things got jacked up is when they started making it expensive to get a domain name

2018-12-09 03:42:43	fosslinux	for .tilde
2018-12-09 03:42:51	fosslinux	is .tilde domains in the "resolver"
2018-12-09 03:42:59	%ben	caching happens all kinds of places
2018-12-09 03:43:05	fosslinux	because the root icann servers dont have .tilde right?
2018-12-09 03:43:06	%ben	you can run something like dnsmasq locally
2018-12-09 03:43:14	fosslinux	ik
2018-12-09 03:43:16	%ben	and that will cache dns records
2018-12-09 03:43:43	fosslinux	like in the comic browser & os & resolver & icann & .com and finally nameserver if noneof the others work
2018-12-09 03:43:44	%ben	but yeah the .tilde nameservers cache stuff for other records too
2018-12-09 03:43:51	fosslinux	but...
2018-12-09 03:43:56	%ben	it stays in the cache for ttl seconds
2018-12-09 03:44:11	fosslinux	how does the request get to the .tilde nameservers
2018-12-09 03:44:30	fosslinux	because dosen't it go to the root servers? which don't have .tilde?
2018-12-09 03:45:11	%ben	no it doesn't go to the root servers cause the .tilde namservers have the authoritative records for .tilde

2018-12-09 03:45:25	fosslinux	ohh ok i kind of get it

2018-12-11 01:38:08	@deepend	hey ubergeek 
2018-12-11 01:41:50	~ubergeek	heyo deepend 
2018-12-11 01:42:16	@deepend	hows things on the tilde dns front? :D 
2018-12-11 01:53:06	~ubergeek	smooth, and uneventfuly.  There's "monitoring" now :)
2018-12-11 01:53:17	~ubergeek	https://yourtilde.com/~ubergeek/tildemon
2018-12-11 01:53:17	TildeBot	Monitoring Report https://bhh.sh/2hg
2018-12-11 01:54:04	@deepend	why it say example.com on each thing? 
2018-12-11 02:05:44	~ubergeek	As a test if it can resolved ICANN names too
2018-12-11 02:05:52	~ubergeek	*resolve
2018-12-11 02:08:30	@deepend	ah makes sense. so that monitoring page actually tests the ability to resolve names? neat
2018-12-11 02:09:28	@deepend	so... if I purchased a domain like tildedns.com or something would having a page where things can be put in one place instead of having multiple urls to goto for information? 
2018-12-11 02:12:28	~ubergeek	sure.  I was looking at buying tildenic.club for that lol
2018-12-11 02:12:48	@deepend	why .club for the nic?
2018-12-11 02:13:59	~ubergeek	dunno.  $0.99 for the first year, and it feels like a "club"
2018-12-11 02:14:07	~ubergeek	I'm not settled on it though
2018-12-11 02:15:15	@deepend	i could buy tildenic.com?  I generally like .com only because the normal yearly price is usually pretty decent.
2018-12-11 02:16:01	%ben	i like .org
2018-12-11 02:16:17	%ben	tildenic.org fits with the whole tildeverse thing
2018-12-11 02:16:34	@deepend	.org is literally 2 dollars more per year for no good reason though lol
2018-12-11 02:16:49	%ben	it's more official than .com
2018-12-11 02:17:00	%ben	why not both
2018-12-11 02:18:03	%ben	oops
2018-12-11 02:18:07	%ben	i just grabbed .org
2018-12-11 02:18:56	@deepend	of course you did.
2018-12-11 02:19:24	@deepend	good, i just wont waste my money then :)
2018-12-11 02:19:46	~ubergeek	lol
2018-12-11 02:21:39	@deepend	guess it seems I'll proabably need to upgrade the vps's the dns servers are on.. already used 132GB of the 500 that is included
2018-12-11 02:21:56	%ben	holy what
2018-12-11 02:22:03	~ubergeek	really?
2018-12-11 02:22:06	@deepend	my thoughts exactly
2018-12-11 02:22:07	@deepend	lol
2018-12-11 02:22:44	%ben	also
2018-12-11 02:22:51	%ben	only 500gb???
2018-12-11 02:23:08	~ubergeek	I can't believe 132GB of traffic has been used...
2018-12-11 02:23:24	@deepend	yea.. is insane . .concidering they are only dns servers..
2018-12-11 02:23:41	@deepend	ben: starting small.
2018-12-11 02:24:11	%ben	that's both tiny and crazy that you've used t hat much already
2018-12-11 02:24:16	%ben	is it all from bind9?
2018-12-11 02:25:12	@deepend	theres nothing else on that machine.. it updates the dns files every hour.. but 99% is all upstream
2018-12-11 02:25:20	%ben	wow
2018-12-11 02:25:36	~ubergeek	yeah, and most of that hourly update should be a delta of zero
2018-12-11 02:26:00	@deepend	Usage:  132.06 GB of 500 GB (26%)
2018-12-11 02:26:02	@deepend	Inbound:  3.88 GB
2018-12-11 02:26:02	%ben	that's wild
2018-12-11 02:26:04	@deepend	Outbound:  132.06 GB 
2018-12-11 02:26:15	%ben	what the hell is it sending
2018-12-11 02:26:24	%ben	dns shouldn't be that big
2018-12-11 02:26:53	@deepend	no idea.. will login and verify.. but the 2 servers have used around the same amount
2018-12-11 02:26:54	TildeBot	no u infinity deepend
2018-12-11 02:28:50	%ben	hmmst
2018-12-11 02:28:59	%ben	ok where do you want me to point tildenic.or
2018-12-11 02:29:01	%ben	g
2018-12-11 02:30:02	@deepend	maybe just point to yourtilde.com and I'll setup a vhost for ubergeek 
2018-12-11 02:30:57	%ben	okidoki
2018-12-11 02:31:39	%ben	done
2018-12-11 02:34:42	@deepend	apparently had postfix installed as well.. so removed that
2018-12-11 02:34:59	@deepend	didn't know the base install of centos had postfix lol
2018-12-11 02:35:00	%ben	i mean that shouldn't do anything
2018-12-11 02:35:16	@deepend	nope I wouldn't think so.. but removed it anyways.. 
2018-12-11 02:35:30	%ben	hhmmmsys
2018-12-11 02:36:02	@deepend	waste of resources if i left it in there
2018-12-11 02:37:01	%ben	something like that
2018-12-11 02:37:30	@deepend	is a very low resource vm
2018-12-11 02:37:55	%ben	sounds like it
2018-12-11 02:38:16	@deepend	dont need much for dns.. or so I thought lol
2018-12-11 02:38:16	%ben	either way tildenic.org is pointed at yourtilde.com's ip
2018-12-11 02:38:28	@deepend	thanks.. will get that vhost setup shortly :)
2018-12-11 02:39:36	%ben	oki
2018-12-11 02:39:40	%ben	ipv6 too fyi
2018-12-11 02:40:01	@deepend	k :) 
2018-12-11 02:40:46	@deepend	updating the vms.. since centos 7.6 is available.. probably why yourtilde had so many updates lol 
2018-12-11 02:41:30	%ben	ayy nice point release
2018-12-11 02:41:40	%ben	debian just had 9.6 
2018-12-11 02:41:43	@deepend	yep.. now all fancy and shit :P
2018-12-11 02:42:28	%ben	something like that
2018-12-11 02:56:32	@deepend	updates... may have ended badly.. lol  oops.. guess time will tell.. 
2018-12-11 02:59:24	%ben	ruh roh
2018-12-11 03:00:50	@deepend	is bitching about not being able to load SELinux policy.. makes no sense
2018-12-11 03:00:56	%ben	hmmst
2018-12-11 03:03:22	@deepend	yeah.. they changed something to do with selinux on 7.6.  hopefully i can fix it lol
2018-12-11 03:03:35	@deepend	not hard to rebuild if needed tho
2018-12-11 03:04:32	%ben	oofs
2018-12-11 04:20:57	@deepend	welp.. tildenic.org is configured. now just need something on the page lol
2018-12-11 04:21:56	%ben	lol brilliant
2018-12-11 04:22:16	%ben	it's still redirecting to yourtilde.com for me
2018-12-11 04:24:43	@deepend	welp.. clear your browser cache? lol
2018-12-11 04:25:04	%ben	lol

2018-12-11 04:26:35	@deepend	and suppose ubergeek is probably not around atm? :D 
2018-12-11 04:27:12	%ben	yeah it's somewhat late
2018-12-11 04:27:22	@deepend	unfortunately
2018-12-11 04:27:32	%ben	rips
2018-12-11 04:27:36	@deepend	^^
2018-12-11 04:36:53	@deepend	there.. just copied some basic information off of the tildegit repo and put it on tildenic.org.. will be good enough until ubergeek is around.
2018-12-11 04:37:38	%ben	lol
2018-12-11 04:37:40	%ben	ok
2018-12-11 04:37:51	%ben	good 4 now

2018-12-11 04:44:50	%ben	nice
2018-12-11 04:47:53	%ben	might want to put everything in div.container
2018-12-11 04:48:01	%ben	that'll center it
2018-12-11 04:52:28	@deepend	me no expert.. lol did it I think?
2018-12-11 04:53:34	%ben	um
2018-12-11 04:53:36	%ben	lemme see

2018-12-11 04:53:48	%ben	did you do a 301
2018-12-11 04:53:51	@deepend	is there a specific class to use with that hacker.css
2018-12-11 04:54:18	%ben	yes
2018-12-11 04:54:21	%ben	container
2018-12-11 04:54:29	@deepend	it is a 301 redirect yes
2018-12-11 04:54:38	%ben	the first div after body needs class container
2018-12-11 04:54:40	@deepend	oh.. ok

2018-12-11 04:58:50	@deepend	not professional by any means.. but will work as a temporary page until me ubergeek or someone makes something better :) 
2018-12-11 04:58:54	%ben	lol
2018-12-11 04:58:56	%ben	perfect
2018-12-11 05:02:13	@deepend	now who wants to make a nic page that someone could register their own domains under .tilde.. :D lol
2018-12-11 05:19:39	%ben	oh boy
2018-12-11 05:21:25	@deepend	could almost do a hacky way.. lol  could have scripts basically just doing git commands to process the request lol
2018-12-11 05:43:01	%ben	ouch 
2018-12-11 05:43:04	%ben	that sounds awful
2018-12-11 05:43:11	@deepend	yep.. it sure does.
2018-12-11 05:43:45	@deepend	guess its a good thing I would never even attempt such a thing. lol  but I have the crazy ideas anyways :D 
2018-12-11 05:44:32	%ben	i do not want to do that lol
2018-12-11 05:44:39	@deepend	i'm actually surprised how well grand theft auto works on linux 
2018-12-11 05:44:48	%ben	5?
2018-12-11 05:45:07	@deepend	yep
2018-12-11 05:45:11	@deepend	proton
2018-12-11 05:45:28	@deepend	dont think online would work without getting banned.. but local play works great
2018-12-11 05:51:05	%ben	graphics card too?
2018-12-11 05:51:20	@deepend	of course
2018-12-11 05:51:23	%ben	nice
2018-12-11 05:51:34	@deepend	nvidia supports linux fairly well
2018-12-11 05:52:07	%ben	huh
2018-12-11 05:52:22	@deepend	why huh?
2018-12-11 05:52:35	%ben	i've not really had any luck with wine or proton
2018-12-11 05:53:04	@deepend	have you had current nvidia drivers installed?   has to be actual nvidia drivers. not that open source driver
2018-12-11 05:53:48	@deepend	and proton running from the steam client.. ive never tried using proton by itself
2018-12-11 05:56:52	%ben	oh i have the debian recommended one
2018-12-11 05:57:07	%ben	i just boot into windwos lol
2018-12-11 05:59:03	@deepend	so probably the open source driver.. since the nvidia one wouldn't be included in the install of debian.. 
2018-12-11 06:00:48	@deepend	not running the newest driver in theory.. running 410.57 on linux.. windows current version is 417.22   .. but the 410 version works good
2018-12-11 06:01:31	@deepend	410.78 is current stable for linux from nvidia
2018-12-11 06:02:24	@deepend	all works good. handles my 144hz monitor great.. dont know if g-sync is supported or not tho
2018-12-11 06:02:29	%ben	i have 390?
2018-12-11 06:02:45	%ben	i guess that's kinda old
2018-12-11 06:03:00	@deepend	oh.. yup g-sync is functional
2018-12-11 06:03:05	@deepend	390 is probably too old
2018-12-11 06:03:06	%ben	nice
2018-12-11 06:04:06	%ben	yah probably
2018-12-11 06:08:55	%ben	ehh this is why i keep the windows dualboot around

2018-12-11 15:06:47	Naglfar	ben, is it possible to use open source driver for gtx1080ti ?
2018-12-11 15:08:44	%ben	yeah but it's awful
2018-12-11 15:08:47	%ben	i've tried it
2018-12-11 15:11:35	jan6	why awful, and how awful?
2018-12-11 15:11:47	jan6	terrible to use, or terrible performance?
2018-12-11 15:13:18	%ben	performance
2018-12-11 15:13:43	Naglfar	ben, you will be amazed using open source radeon driver instead
2018-12-11 15:14:13	%ben	lol would i be able to use radeon drivers with an nvidia card?
2018-12-11 15:14:28	Naglfar	:)
2018-12-11 15:14:49	Naglfar	don't mix it
2018-12-11 15:15:36	Naglfar	I don't believe nvidia allow use it
2018-12-11 15:16:06	Naglfar	radeon drivers are developed to use on amd gpu
2018-12-11 15:16:46	%ben	heh yeah drivers for nvidia cards are notoriously bad and out of date on linux

2018-12-14 18:30:48	Naglfar	I guess there's some issue with my isp since some hours ago, because I can't reach tilde DNS servers from it
2018-12-14 18:41:47	%ben	huh 
2018-12-14 18:41:49	%ben	:(
2018-12-14 18:42:44	~ubergeek	weird.
2018-12-14 18:42:50	~ubergeek	Which one(s)?
2018-12-14 18:43:43	Naglfar	none of 4
2018-12-14 18:43:57	Naglfar	it seems not to be an tilde dns issue
2018-12-14 18:44:13	Naglfar	because I really can't reach oder nameservers
2018-12-14 18:45:50	Naglfar	other*
2018-12-14 18:49:22	~ubergeek	not even 8.8.8.8?
2018-12-14 18:51:00	Naglfar	https://bin.tilde.team/l5my/
2018-12-14 18:52:44	Naglfar	not even with 8.8.8.8
2018-12-14 18:53:22	Naglfar	I did this traceroute using nameserver 192.71.245.208
2018-12-14 19:21:12	~ubergeek	most of those services don't response to ping, so keep that in mind.
2018-12-14 19:21:28	~ubergeek	traceroute uses ICMP ping in order to do the packet tracing.
2018-12-14 19:21:36	~ubergeek	try it with the dig command, or nslookup
2018-12-14 19:26:23	~ubergeek	are you using centurylink, per chance?
2018-12-14 19:26:24	~ubergeek	https://www.richsnapp.com/blog/2018/12-13-centurylink-blocking-internet-in-utah
2018-12-14 19:26:26	TildeBot	CenturyLink is blocking its customer's internet while saying Utah legislators told them to - RichSnapp.com https://bhh.sh/2ji
2018-12-14 19:31:32	Naglfar	if centurylink is an isp: no, I'm not using it

2018-12-18 00:55:28	Naglfar	good news, I can reach 144.202.23.174
2018-12-18 00:55:51	Naglfar	not the other three yet, though
2018-12-18 00:56:50	Naglfar	!serverlist

2018-12-18 00:57:13	~ubergeek	that is durned odd.  What ISP are you using?
2018-12-18 00:59:10	Naglfar	it's jazztel.es
2018-12-18 12:52:33	Naglfar	it seems like I can reach and use .tilde DNS servers again
2018-12-18 12:57:48	~ubergeek	good news.  It's very curious as to why you couldn't to begin with, but I guess we just have to blame "the cloud" :(
2018-12-18 13:10:25	Naglfar	probably some issue in the cloud
