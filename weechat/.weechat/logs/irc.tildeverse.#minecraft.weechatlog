2018-11-15 17:47:32	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: tphantoms will spawn and kill you if you dont sleep for 3 days

2018-11-15 17:49:09	@jan6	(it's real easy though, if you wanted to do it)
2018-11-15 17:50:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: basicly you sit inside a chamber of cactuses and cobwebs and got atem with a enchanted sword
2018-11-15 17:50:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: i need a way to count the days
2018-11-15 17:50:57	@jan6	there's a builtin day counter in the f3 screen
2018-11-15 17:51:04	@jan6	it shows the server days

2018-11-15 17:55:14	@jan6	just keep your eyes open
2018-11-15 17:55:23	@jan6	also a clock might help
2018-11-15 17:56:05	@jan6	it shows current time, so you can track time even underground and stuff
2018-11-15 17:56:28	@jan6	but generally, when log in, note the day count, when log out, not the day count

2018-11-16 14:50:14	edwardthefma	It will have a leaver to make drowneds
2018-11-16 14:50:48	edwardthefma	You will be able to turn it on and off
2018-11-16 14:51:54	@jan6	I'll do the normal one first I guess, have 'em be pushed down a hole
2018-11-16 14:52:14	@jan6	it'd be easy to add a drowning branch to that
2018-11-16 14:52:28	@jan6	also I gotta make a path to it so I don't get lost, lol
2018-11-16 14:53:23	@jan6	I guess you can help with it if you want to

2018-11-16 14:58:28	@jan6	but as I was saying, it's just around the corner from spawn, and also has a railway station, so you should find it quite easily
2018-11-16 14:58:44	edwardthefma	Ok
2018-11-16 14:59:59	edwardthefma	I know how to make reply efficient zombi spawber

2018-11-16 19:09:49	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Do you have your inventories still? 
2018-11-16 19:10:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: yesh
2018-11-16 19:10:17	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: but only the bed location is saved
2018-11-16 19:10:21	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: no homes
2018-11-16 19:10:27	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: my home game is gone
2018-11-16 19:10:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: There must have been some kind of corruption due the disk filling uo 
2018-11-16 19:10:58	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: it didn't save anything I did last time I was on
2018-11-16 19:11:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: either
2018-11-16 19:11:19	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: wwwwwwwtsome whare neer jan spawner i have a deth chest with a dimond pick
2018-11-16 19:11:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I have the enchanted books that I dumped in a chest many hours ago
2018-11-16 19:11:54	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Right but if the plugin's database was corrupted it would have wiped out everyone's stuff 
2018-11-16 19:12:02	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: im cool with starting from scrach
2018-11-16 19:12:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: why so?
2018-11-16 19:12:09	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: inventory is vanilla?
2018-11-16 19:12:24	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Right, so are achievements 
2018-11-16 19:12:37	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: the multiworld seems fine, just the achievements and homes and stuff
2018-11-16 19:12:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Oh, when I said "stuff" thats when I ment 
2018-11-16 19:13:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Homes makes sense, since that's stored by essentials 
2018-11-16 19:14:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: But achievements are tied to playerdata I'm pretty sure 
2018-11-16 19:14:17	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: welp, this is where dynmap showing claims would come handy, I guess, to find lost homes (s long as you've claimed stuff there)
2018-11-16 19:14:49	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: we have our inventories and the world is the sam)
2018-11-16 19:14:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: world is only rolled back about a day
2018-11-16 19:14:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: i never clamed any thing o whell
2018-11-16 19:15:24	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: I didn't roll back the world 
2018-11-16 19:15:32	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: yeah, it did it itself
2018-11-16 19:15:42	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Did it? 
2018-11-16 19:15:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: jan are u neer your spawner
2018-11-16 19:16:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Like, blocks are different? 
2018-11-16 19:16:10	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I mean, I have the stuff I put away today
2018-11-16 19:16:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Hmm 
2018-11-16 19:16:40	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: oh, map seems fine, I think
2018-11-16 19:17:10	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: blocks are fine, inventory is just rolled to where I was the last time I logged in
2018-11-16 19:17:19	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: The server probably stopped writing  playerdata after the drive filled 
2018-11-16 19:17:30	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: at least it wrote blocks
2018-11-16 19:17:47	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: That probably takes priority 
2018-11-16 19:17:51	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: which I placed quite a bit after the inventory
2018-11-16 19:18:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: also edwardthefma, yes I'm here
2018-11-16 19:18:35	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: When I'm back at a computer i'll try to help people find there stuff 
2018-11-16 19:18:58	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: also seems the nicks are gone, but that's really minor detail
2018-11-16 19:19:28	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: afaik only me and edward were online today, so not too much is lost (except achievements and homes)
2018-11-16 19:19:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Troido/dozens' stuff should help most people if they lost their homes to 
2018-11-16 19:20:49	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: I also updated the server jar, so there might a cause 
2018-11-16 19:21:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: It shouldn't be though 
2018-11-16 19:21:29	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: s/there/that 
2018-11-16 19:23:56	tildecraft_mc_bot	edwardthefma was slain by Husk
2018-11-16 19:24:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: oh shit uh, by the way i managed to afk fish up a mending book... im planning to setup a loot sorter at the main fishing hole or something 
2018-11-16 19:24:42	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: like the one in town 
2018-11-16 19:26:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	edwardthefma > needs a pick

2018-11-16 19:30:35	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: at least my maps are intact

2018-11-16 19:31:24	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: tlong gon
2018-11-16 19:31:46	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: nah, death chests are supposed to stay forever, last I heard
2018-11-16 19:31:49	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: losing my homes means i cant get to it even if i wanted to
2018-11-16 19:32:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: edward is it at your ship?
2018-11-16 19:32:10	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: I rememer where that was
2018-11-16 19:32:23	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: I think I even have a map of the surroundings there
2018-11-16 19:32:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: trodo if you can get to my ship plz go thare
2018-11-16 19:32:49	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: I think I know a way
2018-11-16 19:32:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: earlier I mentioned that my nether way gets close to that
2018-11-16 19:34:08	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: why're you digging a straight hole at my base's neighbourhood?
2018-11-16 19:34:25	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: jan6 I managed to get halfway to your island base my overworld travel
2018-11-16 19:34:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: a little more than halway even
2018-11-16 19:35:09	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: im going to work on the grinder in a few
2018-11-16 19:37:11	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: yeah death chests are permanent and protected, and the dynamic map shows us all the terrain people have been, so it's not impossible to rediscover it, especially if someone knew where it was :3 
2018-11-16 19:37:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: don't forget the in-game maps that I have
2018-11-16 19:37:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: always good to know what direction you need to go from spawn
2018-11-16 19:38:13	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: tbh it's kinda fun, AND annoying at the same time to keep stuff, but not homes
2018-11-16 19:38:25	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: also im slowly working up to have replacement gear for people who die, hopefully full diamond sets soon 
2018-11-16 19:38:43	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I don't have full diamons as my main set even, lol
2018-11-16 19:38:47	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: i've actually got 2 perfect fishing rods already, so one for a friend ;) 
2018-11-16 19:38:58	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: i think im the only one on the server using full diamond 
2018-11-16 19:39:05	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: what do you define as "perfect" ?
2018-11-16 19:39:09	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: I have an almost-perfect fishing rod
2018-11-16 19:39:15	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: I just need one more lure level
2018-11-16 19:39:15	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: mending, lure3, unbreaking3, luck3 
2018-11-16 19:39:50	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: one of them is full durability, the other was only crafted from 2 fishing rods, so if i fish with it for a while, it'll be perfect too 
2018-11-16 19:40:05	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: luck2 lure 2 for me
2018-11-16 19:40:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: lemme make that luck 3
2018-11-16 19:40:15	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: hmm can you fish in the end? if so it would mean making an afk fishing farm there would be extra polite to people who want to sleep in the overworld 
2018-11-16 19:40:44	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: if you need mending, theres shitloads of mending rods in the skeleton farm 
2018-11-16 19:40:48	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: and it might even make end survival possible
2018-11-16 19:40:50	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I think you can do everything you want in the end
2018-11-16 19:40:51	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: cuz i was repairing them with that exp 
2018-11-16 19:41:02	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: I need some mending!
2018-11-16 19:41:13	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: end survival has been on my plan list for years, but too lazy, lol
2018-11-16 19:41:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: lolol what even 
2018-11-16 19:41:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: mending rods only, sadly, no mcmmo so can't rip the enchants off them, would be fun if could
2018-11-16 19:41:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: mending rods are easy to get
2018-11-16 19:41:58	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: what are mending rods then?
2018-11-16 19:42:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: hmmm, there should be more in the chests right next to the fishing hole(s) 
2018-11-16 19:42:08	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: tja
2018-11-16 19:42:09	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: fishing rods with Mending 
2018-11-16 19:42:24	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: ah, fishing, I didn't get that
2018-11-16 19:42:25	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: mending bows/rods are pretty easy yes 
2018-11-16 19:42:38	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: so far i've only ever seen one mending book, and it's part of my elytra now ;D 
2018-11-16 19:42:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: I still want a mending bow
2018-11-16 19:42:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: im pretty sure theres one or two in the skele area 
2018-11-16 19:42:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: ? 
2018-11-16 19:43:09	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: oh shit did i leave a bunch of shit in my inventory 
2018-11-16 19:43:18	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: im supposed to be working but im just not 
2018-11-16 19:43:20	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: -,- 
2018-11-16 19:43:30	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: working from home is not realistic for me i think 
2018-11-16 19:43:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: why is mending so important for elytra? you can repair those with phantom membrames too right?
2018-11-16 19:43:40	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: if so then cool, cause you almost certainly lost your home and stashes with it
2018-11-16 19:44:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: anvil repair gets constantly more expensive the more you do it
2018-11-16 19:44:18	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: I though phantom membrane repairs didn't need an anvil?
2018-11-16 19:44:20	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: so eventually you'd need like 50 levels just to repair once
2018-11-16 19:44:31	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: if they don't then maybe it's fine
2018-11-16 19:44:48	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: though inventory-repairing gets rid of any enchantments
2018-11-16 19:45:53	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]troido: I used my mending book on a strong diamond sword I have
2018-11-16 19:46:17	tildecraft_mc_bot	edwardthefma has disconnected
2018-11-16 19:46:19	@khuxkm|lounge	meding is best

2018-11-16 20:05:02	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: water
2018-11-16 20:05:15	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: this isnt efficant
2018-11-16 20:05:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: why not, sure is
2018-11-16 20:05:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I don't want any infinite water blocks here by accident
2018-11-16 20:05:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: what you do is make a regulare grinder
2018-11-16 20:06:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: this is regulare
2018-11-16 20:06:27	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: dispensers pulse water briefly, so the floor is usually spawnable, and you're not using mob ai to get them off the platforms, you force it with water, so it should be pretty high efficiency if you're doing what i assume 
2018-11-16 20:06:43	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: uhh, too complicated
2018-11-16 20:06:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: there's easier ways
2018-11-16 20:06:56	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: water updates are laggy
2018-11-16 20:07:18	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: just have the spawn by height and run away from cats, way way better
2018-11-16 20:08:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: i can't really tell where you're doing this, or what it looks like, ah well nvm 
2018-11-16 20:08:18	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I can't really have browser and game open at same time, so can't get the video itself very well
2018-11-16 20:08:24	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: i dont even see how this is going to work
2018-11-16 20:08:31	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: yeah sending everything into lava, and scaring creepers into a separate system with cats, that's a good way 
2018-11-16 20:08:38	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]troido: I think I've dug the longest nether way in the server

2018-11-16 20:09:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: my thought would be to download the youtube video and launch it in vlc or something 
2018-11-16 20:10:08	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I just need to give you the link
2018-11-16 20:10:10	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: or screenshot the relevant parts and just pull those up in anything

2018-11-16 21:08:29	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: jan6 what about a publicly placed nether chest?
2018-11-16 21:08:44	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: or is that not enough storage?

2018-11-17 09:58:18	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: attack
2018-11-17 09:58:25	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: otherwise it'd be poison
2018-11-17 09:58:53	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~troido@tilde.town: I haven't even seen a pufferfish in-game I think. I thought they were only as item 
2018-11-17 09:59:06	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: now there are some 3d fish too
2018-11-17 09:59:13	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: that are actual mobs

2018-11-17 10:01:06	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: edward made an amateur "drowned farm", making it into kinda deadly trap, cool
2018-11-17 10:04:10	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: where is the farm
2018-11-17 10:04:13	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: ?
2018-11-17 10:04:26	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: where I'm at, down my basement, basically
2018-11-17 10:04:41	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: it's a bodge
2018-11-17 10:06:04	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: you can tp if you want to see it
2018-11-17 10:06:15	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: alright, I think I'm in your caves now
2018-11-17 10:06:47	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: that looks good I think
2018-11-17 10:07:20	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: getting any good loot?
2018-11-17 10:07:31	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: not that much
2018-11-17 10:07:53	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: also I'm not sure converting them will magically give them tridents
2018-11-17 10:08:02	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: still some meat to trade wigh clerics?
2018-11-17 10:08:06	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: ya
2018-11-17 10:08:11	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: 3 stacks already
2018-11-17 10:08:16	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: over a few hours
2018-11-17 10:08:20	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: oh, this is a normal zombie spawner turned into drowned?
2018-11-17 10:08:25	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: also there's no separation between them
2018-11-17 10:08:27	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: yeah
2018-11-17 10:08:49	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: yeah, I don't think that will give them any new items
2018-11-17 10:09:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: all I know is wiki says they won't get nautilus shells, nothing about tridents afaik
2018-11-17 10:10:02	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: they get tridents in bedrock edition I believe
2018-11-17 10:10:40	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: at least it's an xp farm close to my home (and spawn)
2018-11-17 10:11:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: that's nice :)
2018-11-17 10:11:29	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I should make my own xp farm too. I have one zombie spawner and a spider spawner nearby
2018-11-17 10:13:20	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: such fun watching your nametag jump around
2018-11-17 10:13:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: how do you get to or from the spanwer without tp?
2018-11-17 10:14:07	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: down the stairway, into the water, and to the right side, I think
2018-11-17 10:15:31	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: from your home?
2018-11-17 10:15:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: or from here?
2018-11-17 10:15:35	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: yeah
2018-11-17 10:15:41	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: from my home
2018-11-17 10:15:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I guess I can make a proper stairway eventually or something
2018-11-17 10:16:37	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: right now you should see my nametag so you'd have kinda idea if you're going the right way
2018-11-17 10:16:53	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: only from a limited distance
2018-11-17 10:17:05	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: my home's definitely close enough to see it
2018-11-17 10:18:41	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: would you mind if i'd make a tunnel here from my treehouse?
2018-11-17 10:18:56	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: idk where that is, but eh, I guess it's fine
2018-11-17 10:19:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: it's right next to your home, in my original small shelter
2018-11-17 10:19:37	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: it's the really big tree there (acually multiple trees
2018-11-17 10:19:40	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: )
2018-11-17 10:19:55	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: the one close to the chorus farm?
2018-11-17 10:20:23	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: chorus farm?
2018-11-17 10:20:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: that's on the other side of spawn right?
2018-11-17 10:20:50	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I mean this tree here
2018-11-17 10:21:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: other side of river is a house on top of a big tree
2018-11-17 10:21:17	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: oh, that's one of vanta's farms I think
2018-11-17 10:21:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: but I have some cool golden boots now
2018-11-17 10:21:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: which enchant?
2018-11-17 10:21:54	@jan6	feather 3, unbreak 2, projectile prot 4
2018-11-17 10:22:02	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: nice!
2018-11-17 10:22:27	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: but they're golden, so i guess will wear a bit fast
2018-11-17 10:25:31	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: do you use any patters to find your way in caves?
2018-11-17 10:25:43	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: not specifically
2018-11-17 10:26:08	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: just remember the places themselves
2018-11-17 10:26:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: which means I get lost sometimes, but not too often
2018-11-17 10:26:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: one of my tunnels dug into a cave you explored and I wanted to try to find the way from there
2018-11-17 10:27:19	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I don't use any torch patterns or anything so not gonna be easy
2018-11-17 10:27:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: any way to mark dead ends?
2018-11-17 10:27:54	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: nah, I just light em up and turn around
2018-11-17 10:29:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: could you /afk for a second?
2018-11-17 10:29:08	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: thanks :)
2018-11-17 10:32:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: well, seems this is an easy way to get gold.....slooowwly
2018-11-17 10:32:38	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: faster than dozens' farm?
2018-11-17 10:32:42	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: idk
2018-11-17 10:32:56	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: which farm?
2018-11-17 10:33:05	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: zombie pigman farm
2018-11-17 10:33:16	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: by making a lot of nether portals in the overworld
2018-11-17 10:33:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: haven't seen it, but pretty certain pigmen give more gold faster
2018-11-17 11:08:25	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: uhh, kay
2018-11-17 11:08:30	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: ?
2018-11-17 11:08:31	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: so I didn't check it before
2018-11-17 11:08:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: survival inv was fine
2018-11-17 11:08:58	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: but ńow my superflat inv is the same as my previous survival inv?
2018-11-17 11:09:27	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: only a minor inconvenience, as I gotta re-pick all the blocks, but still, hmmm
2018-11-17 11:51:41	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: woo, I managed to calculate portal placement exactly to the right place
2018-11-17 11:51:58	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: for what?
2018-11-17 11:52:30	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I placed a portal in the nether for to my island, and it created an overworld portal exactly at the location where I wanted it
2018-11-17 11:53:26	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: also, imo it'd be nice to have a nether CEILING hub, instead of regular one, there's even a broken portal up there (probably broken so you'd get to the proper hub instead of ceiling)
2018-11-17 11:54:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I've just been reading about a technique to break bedrock
2018-11-17 11:54:18	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: why'd we even need to break it?
2018-11-17 11:54:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: it involves pistons, explosions and good timing
2018-11-17 11:54:33	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: so we can connect the current hub and the ceiling hub
2018-11-17 11:54:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: oh, kay
2018-11-17 11:55:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: explosions pistons and stuff sounds like most every way to do it
2018-11-17 11:55:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: at one point you could basically grow a tree in a specific way to break it, but other than that, every way includes piston glitches using explosions and stuff
2018-11-17 11:57:40	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: though I suppose the easiest way would be to ask sose to punch a hole in the nether roof
2018-11-17 11:58:05	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: indeed

2018-11-18 05:11:48	nilaky	i get the idea of drowning zombies becoming drowned, but i don't get if it makes sense to farm that way, or just collect regular drowned

2018-11-18 19:59:36	@jan6|	it's not the best drowned farm, mind you, there's a better one that pushes them through a portal to the nether, so they'll basically be stored there until you go and load them back up...in theory
2018-11-18 19:59:54	@jan6|	but it's probably good enough as is

2018-11-18 22:03:29	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: even though we live more than 1000 blocks apart
2018-11-18 22:03:29	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Doctor_coleton: with the gold 3x3 piston door

2018-11-21 08:02:54	@jan6|	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: I'm somewhat baffled at the number of times I see people dying on the server 
2018-11-21 08:02:56	@jan6|	same
2018-11-21 08:03:09	@jan6|	I guess they just don't care about dying
2018-11-21 08:04:00	@jan6|	it's the most I've seen ANYONE die in minecraft, tbh, including youtubers and myself
2018-11-21 08:04:58	@jan6|	careless and laggy and don't care, would be my guess why such deaths occur such frequently
2018-11-21 09:20:23	discord	<Nilaky> hlep why do i care about things
2018-11-21 09:26:03	@jan6|	well, I prefer not to die, but I do anyway, on most servers it's me who dies the most, because everyone else knows what they're doing

2018-11-21 17:31:56	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: ah
2018-11-21 17:31:59	@jan6	just go to the nether and mine a few if you need em, they're quite everywhere there (at ground level, that is, just don't mine the ones immediately next to lava, and remember to shift over them to get the middle ones, or to get out of there)
2018-11-21 17:32:16	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: jan6 got some
2018-11-21 17:32:46	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: this is going to be a shared grinder for evryone

2018-11-21 17:34:32	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: you can now go by boat from your place to spawn
2018-11-21 17:34:38	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: oh, yeah
2018-11-21 17:35:15	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: ooh nice, you got a conduit?
2018-11-21 17:35:29	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: yap
2018-11-21 17:36:18	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: you didn't use source blocks here?
2018-11-21 17:36:26	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: tnot yet
2018-11-21 17:36:47	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: do drowned spawn here?
2018-11-21 17:36:55	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: yes
2018-11-21 17:37:09	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: lot of excavation
2018-11-21 17:37:16	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: no

2018-11-21 17:45:30	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: hi :)
2018-11-21 17:45:41	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: I added a map
2018-11-21 17:45:56	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: nice!
2018-11-21 17:46:58	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I have a few more maps in my own cartography rooms
2018-11-21 17:47:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: ah
2018-11-21 17:47:09	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: but they are zoomed out maps of the north
2018-11-21 17:47:16	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: that didn't fit under the roof here
2018-11-21 17:47:44	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: oh yeah, I can see that now
2018-11-21 17:47:55	@jan6	make a big cartography FLOOR
2018-11-21 17:48:11	@jan6	that's oriented correctly
2018-11-21 17:48:15	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: can you do that? place item frames on the floor?
2018-11-21 17:48:47	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: yeah, but I don’t think they’d all fit on the floor here either
2018-11-21 17:48:50	@jan6	you can now place item frames on the floor and ceiling, AND they don't break if you break blocks behind them and you can place blocks inside them
2018-11-21 17:48:57	@jan6	drastic change, but awesome
2018-11-21 17:49:36	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: wastebin they won't fit here, but at least it will make my own cartography rooms more easy to view
2018-11-21 17:49:56	@jan6	make cartography cellar for them then
2018-11-21 17:50:09	@jan6	mapping catacombs
2018-11-21 17:50:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: putting the northern maps in the cellar seems counterintuitive to me
2018-11-21 17:51:32	@jan6	ALL maps, of course
2018-11-21 17:52:21	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: wastebin did you see the boating route to your house?
2018-11-21 17:52:28	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: yes
2018-11-21 17:55:34	@khuxkm|lounge	troido: northern maps on the ceiling, southern maps on the floor :P
2018-11-21 17:56:49	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I prefer to have them on the same side. It's nice to have them next to each other, but if they are inside a corner you miss a few pixels

2018-11-22 05:14:48	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i have 2 identical chestplates, one used to be an alytra
2018-11-22 05:14:50	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: elytra
2018-11-22 05:14:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: blehhh

2018-11-22 05:45:38	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: cuz thats where the duplicated diamond chestplates were (idk which was which, i swapped them a couple times)

2018-11-22 05:47:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: again, no idea which was which, but anything valuable i've been either carrying or keeping in the lightblue shulker box in base

2018-11-22 05:48:19	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: the suspicious thing was unbreaking3 chestplates with matching durability pretty close to like 80% ... told me it was probably a dupe of my current one

2018-11-22 05:49:29	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~s0se: Just the elytra?
2018-11-22 05:49:42	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i think what happened is my inv + the world were snapshotted at different times, both when the chest was in them
2018-11-22 05:49:50	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: so neither snapshot contained my elytra, so poof
2018-11-22 05:49:57	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and duplicated the chestplate

2018-11-22 19:47:28	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: F ... got a mending book with curse of vanishing
2018-11-22 19:47:55	@jan6	lol
2018-11-22 19:48:12	@jan6	actually we should test if it vanishes
2018-11-22 19:48:21	@jan6	with the death chests and everything
2018-11-22 19:48:26	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: oh good idea
2018-11-22 19:48:35	@jan6	with some lesser book probably
2018-11-22 19:49:42	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ok its very tempting to just mending my whole gear set before actually giving them to others
2018-11-22 19:49:43	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: :p
2018-11-22 19:51:01	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: actually if we test, we use a bow with JUST the curse, hehe, so we lose nothing

2018-11-22 19:52:27	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i got 4 books overnight so im thinking they're not THAT rare, so by the time we have a creeper farm for the gunpowder/rockets, i can have a lot more mending books

2018-11-22 20:10:53	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: lol
2018-11-22 20:11:06	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: im deciding not to use any of them until i have a wide selection so
2018-11-22 20:11:10	@jan6	I'm too afraid to fly otherwise
2018-11-22 20:11:15	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: lets get like 20 mending books and decide which ones to use
2018-11-22 20:11:25	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: also elytra just go neutral they dont BREAK
2018-11-22 20:11:32	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: you'll drop but you won't lose them!
2018-11-22 20:11:37	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: according to wiki
2018-11-22 20:12:19	@jan6	would you like to test it?
2018-11-22 20:12:27	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: in creative yes
2018-11-22 20:12:36	@jan6	they don't wear in creative though
2018-11-22 20:13:13	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: in a single player world with cheats, give self a mostly broken set, fly a bit with rockets, see em break
2018-11-22 20:13:28	@jan6	also it'll definitely also be VERY annoying to die in a random spot, and not know where, cause I'll probably panic too much to get f3 open
2018-11-22 20:13:33	@jan6	sure
2018-11-22 20:13:35	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: lol
2018-11-22 20:13:46	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: play with f3 up and also get feather falling bootz
2018-11-22 20:13:54	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and wear full iron armor at least ofc
2018-11-22 20:13:59	@jan6	sm0ll scr33n
2018-11-22 20:14:28	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: use the map online before respawn?
2018-11-22 20:14:44	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: that...could work in theory 
2018-11-22 20:14:51	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: but I have too little ram n stuff 
2018-11-22 20:14:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: or you know, make excuses and play it safe and never die cuz you never leave spawn like me
2018-11-22 20:14:59	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: lol 
2018-11-22 20:15:29	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: I definitely do die

2018-11-22 20:31:39	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: what does it spam?
2018-11-22 20:31:45	@jan6	it advertises a link and qr code to some other irc I think, and it's #happyfloodsgiving
2018-11-22 20:31:53	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: l o l

2018-11-22 20:32:23	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: -.-
2018-11-22 20:33:01	@jan6	I mean, how would you go about banning someone using IPs from all over the place, and sometimes different names?
2018-11-22 20:33:16	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: to connect to town you have to be on the host so
2018-11-22 20:33:23	@jan6	so you're safe
2018-11-22 20:33:36	@jan6	also, it TRIES to mention eveyone in the channel
2018-11-22 20:33:41	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: if someone is port forwarding, they're either complicit or their own pc is being attacked etc
2018-11-22 20:33:49	@jan6	but it cuts off at the edges
2018-11-22 20:34:04	@jan6	yeah, town has it easier in that regart
2018-11-22 20:34:07	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: is this a fish farm?
2018-11-22 20:34:15	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: or fish vault?
2018-11-22 20:34:30	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yep!
2018-11-22 20:34:43	@jan6	why_not_both.jpeg
2018-11-22 20:35:01	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I wanted to say vault but accidentally said farm
2018-11-22 20:35:12	@jan6	still
2018-11-22 20:35:19	@jan6	lock away your trouts
2018-11-22 20:35:46	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I still haven't figured out how afk fishing works
2018-11-22 20:35:48	 *	jan6 begins playing "we are number one" for absolutely no reason
2018-11-22 20:35:50	@jan6	same
2018-11-22 20:35:54	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: use a macro to spam rightclick
2018-11-22 20:36:03	@jan6	on linux that's easy
2018-11-22 20:36:06	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: use F3+P to disable pause/menu on alttab
2018-11-22 20:36:14	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: theres a simple autohotkey script for windows
2018-11-22 20:36:20	@jan6	that too
2018-11-22 20:36:26	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: it gives a little GUI with start/stop buttons and also keybinds
2018-11-22 20:36:50	@jan6	I could say "click this 10 billion times" to a program too
2018-11-22 20:37:03	@jan6	then just kill it when I get back
2018-11-22 20:37:11	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: timer/toggle ezier lol
2018-11-22 20:37:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: when I spam rightclick manually it just keeps throwing th rod again and reeling it back in
2018-11-22 20:38:08	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: aim at the noteblock/pressure plate
2018-11-22 20:38:10	@jan6	you need to aim at a very specific spot
2018-11-22 20:38:22	@jan6	well, very specific line
2018-11-22 20:38:34	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: your first click hits the plate so you cast, the bobber triggers it dropping it down so now you're spamming the noteblock
2018-11-22 20:38:44	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: when you catch, the pressure plate comes back up and you reel in (repeat)
2018-11-22 20:39:39	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: ah, now I get it. I think I was just spamming right click too fast
2018-11-22 20:39:43	@jan6	nah
2018-11-22 20:39:48	@jan6	you can't spam too fast
2018-11-22 20:39:57	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yeah you literally spam it
2018-11-22 20:39:59	@jan6	you were just a little bit off with the aim
2018-11-22 20:40:25	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yup, you're aiming at the top of the pressureplate that disappears when it goes down (if you do it right)
2018-11-22 20:40:30	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: oooookay
2018-11-22 20:40:39	@jan6	what ookay?
2018-11-22 20:40:50	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: you can actually spam too fast and reel it back in immediately
2018-11-22 20:41:03	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: this also happens when you hold the right mouse button down
2018-11-22 20:41:25	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: now just gotta make sure only stackable items make it in
2018-11-22 20:41:47	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and theres a spare 16th slot for bamboo
2018-11-22 20:46:08	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ok so the next fun part is the bulk single-item storage x.x

2018-11-22 20:51:09	@jan6	I wouldn't call that "farming", really
2018-11-22 20:51:13	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ehh
2018-11-22 20:51:22	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: do they spawn? or only in fixed numbers in cities?
2018-11-22 20:51:28	@jan6	idk
2018-11-22 20:51:42	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: oh bleh no
2018-11-22 20:51:47	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: farming them == exploring
2018-11-22 20:51:54	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: still useful as shit tho and with rtp ehh
2018-11-22 20:52:09	@jan6	kinda, I guess
2018-11-22 20:52:39	@jan6	but I wouldn't call rtp-ing around until you find cows to kill "farming cows" either, y'know
2018-11-22 20:52:55	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: any thoughts beyond a tower of hoppers/chests for bulk items tho
2018-11-22 20:53:15	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: cuz i filled like 5 doublechests overnight
2018-11-22 20:53:25	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: the sorter will already help but
2018-11-22 20:55:54	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: hmm
2018-11-22 20:56:16	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i guess i just need to dig this shaft down and fill it with chests
2018-11-22 20:59:43	@jan6	what do you need that many of, anyway?
2018-11-22 20:59:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: junk/treasure
2018-11-22 20:59:59	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: fishing for books
2018-11-22 21:00:06	@jan6	do you want a literal Tower Of Treasure?
2018-11-22 21:00:19	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: so i have 16 slots for fishing stackables, and then a massive storage system for everything else (which cant be sorted in vanilla)
2018-11-22 21:01:06	@jan6	protip, start at sky limit, probably with an item elevator, and then work your way down
2018-11-22 21:01:42	@jan6	16 comes from what?
2018-11-22 21:01:57	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: 15 items in 1.13 and bamboo is added in 1.14
2018-11-22 21:02:37	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: cod/sal/trop/puff/nametag/naut/lily/bowl/leather/flesh/stick/string/bone/ink/tripw + bamboo
2018-11-22 21:02:53	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: slots of what? 
2018-11-22 21:03:06	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: I mean, don't you have chests for those? 
2018-11-22 21:03:12	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: have you seen the vault? it's exactly the same setup
2018-11-22 21:03:27	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: 16 double chests with 3 hoppers, a comparator, repeater, torch, and 3 bits of redstone
2018-11-22 21:03:34	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: each doublechest has all that crap
2018-11-22 21:03:46	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: wew 
2018-11-22 21:03:54	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: 48hoppers/dust, 16 comparators/repeaters/torches
2018-11-22 21:04:35	edwardthefma	Yawn
2018-11-22 21:05:16	@jan6	has anybody made an auto-treefarm? sure wouldn't b bad
2018-11-22 21:05:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: eesh
2018-11-22 21:05:26	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: not yet
2018-11-22 21:05:33	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: is that possible in vanilla?
2018-11-22 21:05:36	@jan6	sure
2018-11-22 21:05:43	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~desvox@tilde.town: oof 
2018-11-22 21:05:44	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yeah sorta, same as fishing i think
2018-11-22 21:05:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: do you need endermen for that?
2018-11-22 21:05:57	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: but i mean, with the axe plugin, ehh
2018-11-22 21:06:04	@jan6	there are crazy wither-powered farms, but I think PROOOOOBABLY smaller scale ones too
2018-11-22 21:06:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: lol what
2018-11-22 21:06:35	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: piston farm which pushes all the wood into one place for you to mine out later (with the axe plugin if u want)
2018-11-22 21:07:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: probably the best for our server, it sends redstone thru sapling/treetrunk which detects when the tree is grown, and feeds you bonemeal or something
2018-11-22 21:07:17	@jan6	pistons can only push whatwasit...15 blocks? so you need a network of pistons feeding into each other in different directions...
2018-11-22 21:07:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yes
2018-11-22 21:08:07	@jan6	also it'd probably need an auto-bonemeal farm then
2018-11-22 21:08:13	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: we have one
2018-11-22 21:08:17	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: its a skele farm
2018-11-22 21:08:20	@jan6	meaning it'll be in the vicinity of that
2018-11-22 21:08:22	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: we're fuckin swimming in bones
2018-11-22 21:08:42	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: its pretty close to spawn, or thru the nether system
2018-11-22 21:08:45	@jan6	you won't it you have an autofarm spamming it for an hour
2018-11-22 21:08:55	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: but we can also cart crates of bone blocks over real fast
2018-11-22 21:09:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: with shulker boxes i guess for max storage
2018-11-22 21:09:25	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: not hard really to get enough bonemeal for a few doublechests of wood, we prob already have enough
2018-11-22 21:10:20	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: hmmm ravine
2018-11-22 21:13:51	@jan6	you need raw bonemeal for the farm
2018-11-22 21:14:03	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: bone blocks/bonemeal are reversible
2018-11-22 21:14:03	@jan6	blocks for transport, sure
2018-11-22 21:14:13	@jan6	but you can't put blocks in the farm
2018-11-22 21:14:26	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: you're stating things i assumed you knew, yep
2018-11-22 21:14:35	@jan6	and if you want it to be auto, you should have it constantly be fed
2018-11-22 21:14:49	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: sigh
2018-11-22 21:14:51	@jan6	otherwise you could just stand a flip a lever manually
2018-11-22 21:15:07	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: its very easy to transport shitloads of bones with just /tpa to someone, then spamming /back
2018-11-22 21:15:32	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and then break it all into meal, load up a doublechest, and it'll go for ages
2018-11-22 21:15:38	@jan6	yeah, but would you like to /back 10 times an hour?
2018-11-22 21:15:53	@jan6	eh whatever
2018-11-22 21:16:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: you do it like 3 times and you've transported 27*3 stacks of bones
2018-11-22 21:16:18	@jan6	which you need to manually restock
2018-11-22 21:16:28	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ?
2018-11-22 21:16:32	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: so?
2018-11-22 21:16:38	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: do you know how much wood that is?
2018-11-22 21:16:48	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: why would we need that much wood tho
2018-11-22 21:16:55	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: in vanilla mind you
2018-11-22 21:17:10	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: in modded you literally just build a treefarm ofc lmao
2018-11-22 21:18:06	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i guess im confused why
2018-11-22 21:18:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i havent been building stuff for shits n giggles really, decoration and function based on what i expect ppl to use
2018-11-22 21:18:34	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and anything im helping with has the same features
2018-11-22 21:19:08	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: so if you're building modded-mc scale builds for resources we can't use on a modded-mc scale, have fun, but it confuses me and it saps my energy to want to help it seems
2018-11-22 21:20:25	@jan6	eh whatever
2018-11-22 21:20:54	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: you're excited about it and that's cool
2018-11-22 21:21:18	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: backing up a bit "do we have an auto tree farm yet" "nah, noone wanted one yet"
2018-11-22 21:21:26	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: wasn't that the context of the convo?
2018-11-22 21:22:17	@jan6	kinda
2018-11-22 21:22:26	@jan6	but again, whatever
2018-11-22 21:23:08	@jan6	I'm just lazy AF
2018-11-22 21:23:43	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: fuuuuck i do actually need like 8 stacks of wood right now tho
2018-11-22 21:23:46	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: for chests/hoppers
2018-11-22 21:24:06	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ok 10 stacks of wood
2018-11-22 21:24:21	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and like 8 stacks of iron ;p
2018-11-22 21:24:37	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: did i mention im overkilling this
2018-11-22 21:24:44	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: lol
2018-11-22 21:26:55	@jan6	^
2018-11-22 21:27:27	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ya i know but this is a fishing farm that i have no idea how long will need to run
2018-11-22 21:27:38	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and i cant sort this crap so i have to store it
2018-11-22 21:27:46	@jan6	there's no such thing as too much storage ;P
2018-11-22 21:27:48	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: and i plan to get enough mending books for everyone
2018-11-22 21:27:50	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: lol
2018-11-22 21:28:21	@jan6	make sure you have several fishing cabins next to each other for maximum efficiency
2018-11-22 21:28:30	@jan6	so several people can farm at once
2018-11-22 21:28:33	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: lol it wouldn't be hard to add a couple
2018-11-22 21:29:04	@jan6	I wonder, if 4 people were to hit the same noteblock, would that still work?
2018-11-22 21:29:10	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: jesus christ a bunch of cod
2018-11-22 21:29:11	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: no
2018-11-22 21:29:33	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: cuz the 4 bobbers would have to all catch a fish and then maybe only 1 manages to reel it in
2018-11-22 21:29:41	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: the trapdoor is kinda useless afaik
2018-11-22 21:29:48	@jan6	no, I don't mean it like that
2018-11-22 21:29:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: the pressure plate and noteblock are important i mean
2018-11-22 21:29:58	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ohhh in a + shape
2018-11-22 21:29:59	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yeah sure
2018-11-22 21:30:02	@jan6	I mean, like have a plus-shape of cabins
2018-11-22 21:30:05	@jan6	yeah
2018-11-22 21:30:21	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: but having 4 cabins side-by-side with 1 block in between is gonna look cute
2018-11-22 21:30:23	@jan6	I just wonder if there's such a thing as "too fast music"
2018-11-22 21:30:30	@jan6	do that then
2018-11-22 21:30:38	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: nah you're actually not playing it, you're changing the note constantly
2018-11-22 21:30:46	@jan6	I know
2018-11-22 21:30:51	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: its just there so you spamming rightclick doesnt cast
2018-11-22 21:30:53	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: :D
2018-11-22 21:31:12	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: no other purpose at all, so if 4 ppl smacking it doesnt cause reel/cast, its fine
2018-11-22 21:31:12	@jan6	imagine how fast it'd go though if 4 people spammed it at one ;P
2018-11-22 21:31:22	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: 1tick clock for playing the note
2018-11-22 21:31:31	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: mmm

2018-11-22 21:48:56	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: spruce is my fav to farm
2018-11-22 21:49:08	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: always purely vertical trees, so the axe plugin <3 <3 <3

2018-11-23 08:11:34	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: its usually best to put it on an elytra if you have one
2018-11-23 08:11:48	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: but we don't have infinite gunpowder yet
2018-11-23 08:11:59	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: I don’t, should I save it for that?
2018-11-23 08:12:08	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~wastebin: also I have a lot of gunpowder
2018-11-23 08:12:28	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: well, it's great for an elytra so you dont have to farm phantoms
2018-11-23 08:12:32	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: to repair
2018-11-23 08:12:48	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: feel free to use on a diamond tool/armor if you prefer
2018-11-23 08:12:51	@jan6|	i need one, y u ignore me :(

2018-11-23 08:14:11	@jan6|	cool
2018-11-23 08:14:38	@jan6|	you can never have too much mending though
2018-11-23 08:15:32	@jan6|	also, let's make a little creeper farm a little out the spawn
2018-11-23 08:15:52	@jan6|	so it's close, but doesn't get loaded unintentionally
2018-11-23 08:16:01	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: im wondering why not make it up at the build limit, so the underground isnt loaded and people don't dig bunch of dark spaces nearby..
2018-11-23 08:16:20	@jan6|	sure....if you make a way to there
2018-11-23 08:16:23	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: someone's been digging unlit tunnels by the skeleton farm for some reason
2018-11-23 08:16:39	@jan6|	you don't actually DIG for creeper farm
2018-11-23 08:17:17	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i mean, i've done mob farms in the sky before, it's not the hardest thing.. um
2018-11-23 08:17:25	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: ???
2018-11-23 08:18:05	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: someone has been digging randomly by the skeleton farm because it's underground and there weren't signs saying "dont make a bunch more dark spaces near this, you know that's gonna fuck with spawns right?"
2018-11-23 08:18:50	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: you're referring to a 2-high room in the dark in random place for spawning short mobs, then filtering for creepers right? someone did something similar right under vantablack's home, and yes they dug it out
2018-11-23 08:25:20	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: wastebin are you tryin to do something? am i interfering?
2018-11-23 08:37:38	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: aight im gonna hit the road

2018-11-23 17:00:35	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: they dont want to spawn
2018-11-23 17:00:37	@jan6	doesn't matter if it's AS effective
2018-11-23 17:00:53	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: has any drowned spawned at all?
2018-11-23 17:00:54	@jan6	also given your expertise, I'm not surprised (sorry)
2018-11-23 17:01:09	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: i have seen 1 maby 2
2018-11-23 17:01:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I think I read something about drowned now spawning in warmer oceans
2018-11-23 17:01:34	@jan6	that might be a thing too
2018-11-23 17:01:45	@jan6	in that case I can make one for myself too ;P

2018-11-23 17:09:15	@jan6	box means the drowned that are outside your box CANNOT ENTER, meaning EVEN LESS drowned
2018-11-23 17:09:48	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: the box will be the size of the square
2018-11-23 17:10:01	@jan6	which square is THE square?
2018-11-23 17:10:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: and it will drowned out the light
2018-11-23 17:10:14	@jan6	drowned don't care about the light
2018-11-23 17:10:29	@jan6	also just build a roof instead of box then!
2018-11-23 17:10:41	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: actually they do care about the light
2018-11-23 17:10:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: a roof would work better though
2018-11-23 17:11:05	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: but I liked the coral reef :(

2018-11-23 20:08:53	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: mobs land here
2018-11-23 20:09:20	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: with half a heart of health left (for unarmoured skeletons)
2018-11-23 20:09:32	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: so you can finish them for xp
2018-11-23 20:09:51	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: we should make this adaptable
2018-11-23 20:10:02	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: so, like, they have 1 heart left because of the slabs, right?
2018-11-23 20:10:13	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I just expanded the storage a bit since the chest were getting very full
2018-11-23 20:10:30	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: well, if you don't care about the XP and just want the items, the slabs should be retractable :P
2018-11-23 20:10:47	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I think it's most useful as xp farm
2018-11-23 20:10:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: nah
2018-11-23 20:11:04	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: because the items are as valuable as the XP
2018-11-23 20:11:09	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: do the items also drop when not killed by a player?
2018-11-23 20:11:22	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: sorry, I didn't realize I would hit you
2018-11-23 20:11:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: I think so
2018-11-23 20:11:32	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: plus, the whole point of the AFK spot is to let the mobs die
2018-11-23 20:11:44	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: it doesn't work when you remove the killing ability
2018-11-23 20:11:59	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: afaik almost everything drops the same with exeption of XP and I think very few items...
2018-11-23 20:12:10	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: then you just come back from AFK with a platform full of mobs and no items
2018-11-23 20:12:17	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: plus the mob cap becomes an issue
2018-11-23 20:13:14	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: bows are useful :P
2018-11-23 20:13:29	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I still need to make a good one
2018-11-23 20:13:33	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: but like, for example, right now I need the XP more than the items
2018-11-23 20:13:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: I could give less of a hoot about getting bones, I need 17 levels to put mending on my fishing rod
2018-11-23 20:14:12	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: but maybe later I need bonemeal for a farm
2018-11-23 20:14:14	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: wewlad @ fishing storage
2018-11-23 20:14:27	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: enough storage to afk for a month
2018-11-23 20:14:29	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: so I'd care less about the XP and more about maxing out bone
2018-11-23 20:14:34	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: *bones
2018-11-23 20:14:40	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: we have a few stacks of bone blocks here
2018-11-23 20:15:21	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: 15 stacks of bone blocks + 40 stacks of bones
2018-11-23 20:16:51	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: maybe we should replace some of the cobble from the drop by glass blocks
2018-11-23 20:16:58	+tildecraft_mc_bot	jan69 > thinks fishing storage should branch out s'more, for stuff like separating saddles and other possibly-useful stuff 
2018-11-23 20:16:58	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: so it's easier to see what's going on
2018-11-23 20:19:10	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: jan6 go build it then
2018-11-23 20:19:40	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: are saddles stackable?
2018-11-23 20:19:51	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: no
2018-11-23 20:19:53	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: a bit lazy, so might, in a few months ;(
2018-11-23 20:19:57	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~minerobber: if not, you'll need to do specific per-item filters
2018-11-23 20:19:58	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: no they aren't indeed
2018-11-23 20:20:12	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]jan69: same with water bottles

2018-11-24 16:20:26	edwardthefma	If we take the survivel seed and find a illager base  in a chunk that's not loaded
2018-11-24 16:22:05	edwardthefma	Then we can block off the chunk then when the server updates to 1.14 we can find one right away
2018-11-24 16:23:51	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: how do you want to block of a chunk?

2018-11-24 16:41:19	@jan6	assuming the map generation doesn't change right before release
2018-11-24 16:42:28	@jan6	also you'd need to do some haxing to deduce the points
2018-11-24 16:56:19	@jan6	also you'd need to do some haxing to deduce the points
2018-11-24 17:02:32	edwardthefma	You can use the f3 screen to get points
2018-11-24 17:05:47	@jan6	...
2018-11-24 17:06:01	@jan6	go ahead
2018-11-24 17:06:26	@jan6	run around in a snapshot world until you find a place and then get the coords
2018-11-24 17:14:37	edwardthefma	Jan did you check us box

2018-11-24 19:03:17	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I picked it. Thanks :)
2018-11-24 19:04:22	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: nilaky by the way, how does the slime farm in the swamp work?
2018-11-24 19:08:55	@jan6	they spawn in the dark, kinda like husks and stuff
2018-11-24 19:09:23	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: how do you use it?
2018-11-24 19:11:56	edwardthefma	Put it in a anvil
2018-11-24 19:16:05	discord	<Nilaky> Its not setup
2018-11-24 19:16:38	discord	<Nilaky> People kept saying they wanted to build their own, noone offered to help, just “im gonna dig mine”
2018-11-24 19:16:45	discord	<Nilaky> So i gave up
2018-11-24 19:16:59	discord	<Nilaky> I might remove all the blocks and fill it back in
2018-11-24 19:17:20	discord	<Nilaky> Sorry despair and negativity are hitting me real hard on that topic
2018-11-24 19:21:27	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: :( I liked you effort
2018-11-24 19:23:45	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: but yeah, I think I was also building my own at that time
2018-11-24 19:24:22	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: do you have a design? can I help finishing it?
2018-11-24 19:44:26	discord	<Nilaky> The dug out area would drop to bedrock and have hoppers for collection. The idle point would be important im not sure where it goes but if its not in the right place the farm produces a bunch of crap drops
2018-11-24 19:45:29	discord	<Nilaky> As long as the collection hoppers are around 2-3 blocks above bedrock, i can make it sort only slime and chuck the rest on the ground as junk, and worry about the collection point later i think
2018-11-24 19:46:26	discord	<Nilaky> Ideally tho i think we might want live slimes for sword farming
2018-11-24 19:46:30	@jan6	make it about 5 blocks from bedrock then, so you can have a storage place too
2018-11-24 19:46:42	discord	<Nilaky> Looting 3 is insane u guise
2018-11-24 19:46:57	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I'm still trying to get that enchant
2018-11-24 19:47:05	@jan6	add mending and sharpness and BOOM
2018-11-24 19:47:30	discord	<Nilaky> I have one already, i think its sharp4,mend,unbreak3,loot3
2018-11-24 19:47:39	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I have a sword with mending, sharpness, fire and unbreaking so I really want to add looting to that
2018-11-24 19:47:45	@jan6	OP farming
2018-11-24 19:47:49	discord	<Nilaky> And i think theres another in a chest somewhere
2018-11-24 19:47:57	discord	<Nilaky> Or a book
2018-11-24 19:48:07	discord	<Nilaky> Fishing op as fuck
2018-11-24 19:48:20	@jan6	if only you could filter ALL enchanted books somewhere
2018-11-24 19:48:26	discord	<Nilaky> I need to redo the fish farm omg
2018-11-24 19:48:36	@jan6	redo why?
2018-11-24 19:48:46	discord	<Nilaky> Make the loot go i. A staircase so i can add a dump at the end
2018-11-24 19:49:06	discord	<Nilaky> So u can pick out the good books and then trash the whole supply so its empty for afk farming
2018-11-24 19:49:45	discord	<Nilaky> We got like 5 double chests full of unstackables, and 15+1(1.14 bamboo) of stackables chests
2018-11-24 19:49:51	discord	<Nilaky> Fishing op

2018-11-24 19:50:33	discord	<Nilaky> Change the loot tower to a loot staircase
2018-11-24 19:50:39	discord	<Nilaky> No way dude its toooo much

2018-11-25 14:51:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: no, why?
2018-11-25 14:52:08	edwardthefma	I was told the flatter their ground the better
2018-11-25 14:52:39	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I like the oceanfloor as it is now
2018-11-25 14:53:07	edwardthefma	Its not in a reavean
2018-11-25 14:53:30	edwardthefma	Or in a hilly area
2018-11-25 14:53:52	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: there's 2 ravines right next to it
2018-11-25 14:54:31	edwardthefma	Within spawning radius of the grinder
2018-11-25 14:55:24	edwardthefma	About 10 to 20 blocks

2018-11-25 15:00:24	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: i own a copy of minchat for android
2018-11-25 15:00:43	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: what's that?
2018-11-25 15:01:17	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: its a app for mincraft that lets you log into servers to chat
2018-11-25 15:01:48	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: but you cant do anything but chat
2018-11-25 15:02:15	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: hmm, the luring is not great. I might need to improve on that
2018-11-25 15:02:46	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: by the way edward, please close all trapdoors do the villagers don't fall down
2018-11-25 15:03:12	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: ok
2018-11-25 15:03:21	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: (and for the lowest need to be closed for the loot to flow correctly)
2018-11-25 15:03:54	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: anyways, don't we kind of have that chat login already with the irc bridge?
2018-11-25 15:04:36	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: this logs in a picsical minecraft account
2018-11-25 15:04:45	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: pysical
2018-11-25 15:05:17	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: I'm not sure if drowned can also drop tridents when killed by magma. I may need to change it to push the drowned upwards instead
2018-11-25 15:05:20	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: we could use it to set a account to afk forever
2018-11-25 15:05:33	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: and then use a manual killing trap (possibly in the nether)
2018-11-25 15:06:45	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~troido_: anyways, I've got to go for a while. I'll afk around here for now

2018-11-25 19:33:20	@jan6	it doesn't
2018-11-25 19:33:30	discord	<Nilaky> ed/doc
2018-11-25 19:33:39	@jan6	well, it's partially that
2018-11-25 19:33:45	discord	<Nilaky> ur good jan6 i rarely see you die or dc
2018-11-25 19:33:47	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: tthe nework is slow my nephues are streaming constent
2018-11-25 19:33:48	@jan6	but mostly it's them doing it cause lag
2018-11-25 19:34:24	@jan6	but edwardthefma is definitely the Server Champion of Dying
2018-11-25 19:34:28	discord	<Nilaky> Is everyone on wifi? I have more questions
2018-11-25 19:35:03	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: evrybodys on the wifi so i just deral with it
2018-11-25 19:35:14	+tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: deal
2018-11-25 19:35:26	@jan6	whenever possible, you should try to play online games on wired connection
2018-11-25 19:35:27	discord	<Nilaky> Wifi that isn’t AC protocol is kinda limited in bandwidth... if you got an ethernet cable the wifi instability would go away
2018-11-25 19:35:36	@jan6	^
2018-11-25 19:35:54	discord	<Nilaky> They make 50 foot long flat cables you can tape to the ground easy
2018-11-25 19:36:05	@jan6	most home wifi routers don't handle several people doing stuff very well
2018-11-25 19:36:24	discord	<Nilaky> Gaffer tape is like duct tape but a rough matte colored finish so it blends wih our carpet a bit
2018-11-25 19:36:52	@jan6	any tape is fine tbh, as long as it's not sticking out very much
2018-11-25 19:37:40	@jan6	you don't NEED the tape anyway
2018-11-25 19:37:53	@jan6	it just prevents you from tripping over it and stuff

2018-11-25 20:29:06	@jan6	I might want one too, never can have too many rockets
2018-11-25 20:29:07	discord	<Nilaky> o
2018-11-25 20:29:11	edwardthefma	Drowned farm
2018-11-25 20:29:16	discord	<Nilaky> yes we all need one for rockets :3
2018-11-25 20:29:39	@jan6	I have mentioned wanting one, but not building one
2018-11-25 20:29:44	@jan6	it's real easy tbh
2018-11-25 20:29:57	discord	<Nilaky> yeah im actually looking at one that doesn't even spawn the other mobs
2018-11-25 20:30:01	edwardthefma	Let's try to destroy spawn with TNT
2018-11-25 20:30:05	discord	<Nilaky> i assume its the one you're referring to
2018-11-25 20:30:06	discord	<Nilaky> no
2018-11-25 20:30:09	discord	<Nilaky> let's no

2018-11-25 20:30:37	@jan6	is that it?
2018-11-25 20:30:44	@jan6	LogicalGeekBoy
2018-11-25 20:35:03	discord	<Nilaky> nah gnembon video doesn't use a cat, he mentions you put trapdoors on the roof, and either glass or cobblestone walls to block spiders
2018-11-25 20:38:56	discord	<Nilaky> the big difference is the gnembon spawner can be tiled vertically really easily, and uses dispenser/observer chains to flush the mobs
2018-11-25 20:38:57	discord	<Nilaky> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guvMmdeZqiI&t=1126s
2018-11-25 20:39:51	@jan6	mine is better imo, carpets r cheap, cats r scwarey, and they run out by themselves, and is also easily tileable
2018-11-25 20:40:36	discord	<Nilaky> i see, he has duplicated up
2018-11-25 20:40:57	@jan6	you just replicate the floor pattern on the ceiling, basically
2018-11-25 20:41:21	discord	<Nilaky> i get that, but ah, per-floor cost of yours is a cat, mine is 3 redstone and a quartz
2018-11-25 20:41:48	discord	<Nilaky> and im not feelin the cat ai logic really
2018-11-25 20:42:35	discord	<Nilaky> i get it, i just don't know how i feel about actually building it, so if you don't want me building gnembon's then i'm not building anything
2018-11-25 20:42:36	discord	<Nilaky> :/
2018-11-25 20:42:37	@jan6	do you not know? creepers are scared AF of cats, cats actually hunt them down if you let them
2018-11-25 20:42:57	@jan6	build it, feel free to
2018-11-25 20:42:57	discord	<Nilaky> i get it
2018-11-25 20:43:14	discord	<Nilaky> i do not know how i feel about actually finding cats, breeding cats, using entities to feed a farm
2018-11-25 20:43:23	@jan6	if I am to build one, it'll be at my island at like, 2k, so not that accessible anyway
2018-11-25 20:43:32	@jan6	so you do your design
2018-11-25 20:43:35	discord	<Nilaky> villager lures i kinda understand for sorting out zombies, but ehh
2018-11-25 20:43:52	@jan6	cats breed with fish, very easy with the afk fishing farm
2018-11-25 20:44:12	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~vantablack@tilde.town: let me know if you need help building it :D 
2018-11-25 20:44:38	@jan6	what's the difference with villagers or cats as the main bit of the farm?
2018-11-25 20:44:50	<--	amcclure[team] (amcclure@tilde.team) has left #minecraft ("WeeChat 2.3")
2018-11-25 20:44:50	+tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > amcclure@tilde.team left #minecraft :"WeeChat 2.3" 
2018-11-25 20:46:14	discord	<Nilaky> villagers are used for the safest mobs since zombies have no range/aoe or any form of dangerous stuff
2018-11-25 20:47:02	discord	<Nilaky> i'd prefer not to be going inside the creeper farm to maintain cats n such but ehh
2018-11-25 20:52:08	discord	<Nilaky> you don't build stuff for the community, just in your own base?
2018-11-25 20:52:16	discord	<Nilaky> huh
2018-11-25 20:53:23	@jan6	I don't build at all
2018-11-25 20:53:33	@jan6	I don't even have a HOUSE
2018-11-25 20:54:02	@jan6	I live in literally a cave-ish thing that I didn't even dig out, just put my stuff in front of

2018-11-25 20:55:14	discord	<Nilaky> oh
2018-11-25 20:55:18	@jan6	the one time I tried to build for community was a signboard that happened to kinda block access to stuff and was taken down as such (the graveyard memorial isn't of use, though it's the only thing I've actually built, overall)
2018-11-25 20:55:47	discord	<Nilaky> ya i heard about that hm
2018-11-25 20:56:39	discord	<Nilaky> i mean it's a cool concept, just ended up being in the middle of town in a way that blocked line of sight to existing buildings and such? i heard it got partly rebuilt but it might be kinda small and not-updated to be used as intended
2018-11-25 20:57:18	discord	<Nilaky> I'd bet the best place for that right now would be on the wall of the shaft that goes into the ground, for the transit tunnel

2018-11-25 20:57:23	@jan6	no idea of it rebuilt? I definitely haven't seen it anywhere
2018-11-25 20:57:36	discord	<Nilaky> it's visible, but not in the way really
2018-11-25 20:57:47	discord	<Nilaky> imagine |||sign||||||// tunnel
2018-11-25 20:58:00	discord	<Nilaky> like, someone cut away wall of the tunnel a bit, so don't recover that, uh
2018-11-25 20:58:04	discord	<Nilaky> i can paint the area in glass

2018-11-25 20:58:46	@jan6	and it didn't have that much point anyway, just a place to put requests and offers, such as "I need gold" "I have cactus, need any?" and stuff
2018-11-25 20:59:02	@jan6	better to do with a shared book anyway, I guess

2018-11-25 21:24:52	edwardthefma	It now collects items all the way around the grinder

2018-11-25 21:26:58	edwardthefma	The stuff never got to the hopper

2018-11-25 21:33:29	edwardthefma	And you were correct pushing the mobs into the nether to kill them in the nether is more effective

2018-11-26 05:10:06	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: doublechest to feed an item sorter, two wings of item sorting, feeding into a doublechest per item, that feeds into a tower
2018-11-26 05:10:21	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: you'd end up with 2 wings sorting each item, so it would process a doublechest faster
2018-11-26 05:10:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: might be able to do something insane to take that even further idk
2018-11-26 05:10:54	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: actually maybe that's why people use water streams instead of hoppers nowadays

2018-11-26 14:52:25	@khuxkm	so it 1) processes faster and 2) processes equally given an equal amount of items

2018-11-26 19:19:00	nilaky	when you say "fish farm" do you mean afk fishing farm, or "a pretty place to fish"?

2018-11-26 19:30:17	@jan6	except the spacebar spring will wear down
2018-11-26 19:30:19	@jan6	but sure
2018-11-26 19:30:25	@khuxkm	idc
2018-11-26 19:30:26	@khuxkm	:P
2018-11-26 19:31:01	@jan6	if that remap would work though (if won't I think the glitch was patched as a whole anyway) then no stone would be needed
2018-11-26 19:31:25	@jan6	also I'd just run xdotool instead, lol
2018-11-26 19:31:31	@jan6	apt show xdotool
2018-11-26 19:43:58	nilaky	"if you use an autoclicker" lolwut
2018-11-26 19:44:55	nilaky	but yeah i kinda wish fishing had an automatic quality in vanilla
2018-11-26 19:45:11	nilaky	fishing farms in modded are ... a hundred different kinds of bullshit at once
2018-11-26 19:45:14	@jan6	^autofish in vanilla plz
2018-11-26 19:45:28	@jan6	just...add a "autouser" into vanilla plz, mojang
2018-11-26 19:45:41	@jan6	it'd make SO MUCH STUFF POSSIBLE
2018-11-26 19:45:48	@jan6	also OP AF
2018-11-26 19:46:01	nilaky	plop down a cube, hook it into power pipes and item pipes, and bam you have a full-blown sorting system with void upgrades (delete extras) and sort out books from the rest of the loot ... wot
2018-11-26 19:46:19	@jan6	nah, just hoppers and redstone for vanilla
2018-11-26 19:46:38	nilaky	plz reread
2018-11-26 19:46:40	@jan6	but sorting books would be REAL useful
2018-11-26 19:46:44	nilaky	"fishing farms in modded" was my topic
2018-11-26 19:46:58	@jan6	"fishing farms in vanilla" was my topic
2018-11-26 19:47:03	nilaky	also "hundred different kinds of bullshit" cuz it's not even the same game lmao
2018-11-26 19:47:08	nilaky	have you seen my autosorters?
2018-11-26 19:47:13	nilaky	i did one in the fishing farm :3
2018-11-26 19:47:39	nilaky	and ofc now that i've done it, i found out there's a version that picks out unstackables first >.<
2018-11-26 19:47:40	nilaky	oops
2018-11-26 19:47:56	nilaky	vanilla tho, 4u
2018-11-26 19:48:25	nilaky	anyways uh, yeah, vanilla sorting and stuff is really cool and I like it
2018-11-26 19:49:07	nilaky	I can't shake the feeling there must be some way to distinguish books from other items
2018-11-26 19:49:16	@jan6	if only you could sort stuff like books
2018-11-26 19:49:23	@jan6	also, do you sort nametags yet?
2018-11-26 19:49:43	nilaky	all 15+1 stackables (15 1.13, 1 reserved for bamboo in 1.14)
2018-11-26 19:49:57	nilaky	we got a bunch
2018-11-26 19:50:30	nilaky	also for every item there's up to 41 of them stuck in the sorting system itself as a filter, e.g. leather looks empty but there's actually at least 41 of it in the system
2018-11-26 19:50:51	nilaky	well 42, one more gets stuck in the lower hopper too
2018-11-26 19:51:06	nilaky	i think leather is "junk" so we dont get much hehe
2018-11-26 19:53:25	@jan6	y
2018-11-26 19:53:30	@jan6	leather is such useful
2018-11-26 19:53:52	@jan6	and it is stackable
2018-11-26 19:54:01	nilaky	oooooooooooo
2018-11-26 19:54:54	nilaky	when i get home im adding a charcoal furnace to the fishing hole, as well as a brewing stand
2018-11-26 19:55:35	nilaky	apparently you can burn rods/bows and grab water in a similar way
2018-11-26 19:55:44	nilaky	so just saddles/books
2018-11-26 19:55:53	@jan6	you definitely can burn most wood stuff
2018-11-26 19:55:59	@jan6	you can burn wood tools too
2018-11-26 19:56:04	nilaky	yes
2018-11-26 19:56:11	@jan6	and do not burn enchanted stuff plz
2018-11-26 19:56:17	nilaky	but this means it's possible to get *closer* to filtering out books
2018-11-26 19:56:17	@khuxkm	/2/2
2018-11-26 19:56:18	@jan6	regulars is fine
2018-11-26 19:56:22	@jan6	yeah
2018-11-26 19:56:35	nilaky	nah im gonna burn enchanted rods/bows, or at least have a switch for it
2018-11-26 19:56:44	@jan6	nay
2018-11-26 19:56:52	nilaky	you only get 2 options bud: 1. clog system 2. actually get mending books
2018-11-26 19:57:12	nilaky	unless you can fix the iron farm, clogging the system with mending fishing rods is shit
2018-11-26 19:57:25	@jan6	3) we can make a hopper line to "junkyard express"
2018-11-26 19:57:25	nilaky	cuz i made over 100 hoppers and ate most of our iron
2018-11-26 19:57:46	nilaky	unless you can fix the iron farm, making a junkyard express is shit
2018-11-26 19:58:01	nilaky	golems keep getting stuck in the village or worse, outside
2018-11-26 19:58:19	@jan6	ROOF
2018-11-26 19:58:42	nilaky	?
2018-11-26 19:58:56	@jan6	would prevent them being in the village
2018-11-26 19:59:25	nilaky	wouldn't a roof also block the sky meaning it's no longer actually considered a village for golem spawns?
2018-11-26 19:59:45	@khuxkm	I like mending fishing rods
2018-11-26 19:59:47	@khuxkm	'/2
2018-11-26 19:59:54	@jan6	well, why'd the villager are be needed to? houses DO have roofs after all
2018-11-26 20:00:11	@jan6	and golems are supposed to spawn in the water
2018-11-26 20:00:17	@jan6	which will have light
2018-11-26 20:00:27	nilaky	khuxkm: do you like 300 of them cuz that's what im talking about, it's not that hard to get a perfect rod, i've made 2 already and after i make 10 of them, no, they're shit
2018-11-26 20:00:28	nilaky	:p
2018-11-26 20:00:44	@jan6	they're nice tho
2018-11-26 20:00:46	nilaky	jan6: what? "why'd the villager are be needed to?"
2018-11-26 20:00:53	@jan6	s/are/area
2018-11-26 20:02:19	nilaky	when i first read up on how villages are defined in the code, it was important that doors be very close to a block exposed to sunlight, and roofing in the entire village portion would break that definition, unless you also moved the doors, which means rebuild the whole village area i think
2018-11-26 20:02:23	@khuxkm	make a hopper line to my base and dump it in chests :P
2018-11-26 20:02:47	nilaky	and i'm not certain, the iron golem spawn point might be offcenter or move if we do that
2018-11-26 20:03:23	nilaky	khuxkm: i might have the packed ice to do that, but hoppers off to a base is gonna be a "no" from me, again, see the iron farm issue
2018-11-26 20:03:43	nilaky	also i moved the iron colelction point up to a place outside the farm
2018-11-26 20:03:59	nilaky	collection point is on top of the iron armory (press button, receive iron armor)

2018-11-28 04:56:05	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: Hey everyone, bad news, the minecraft server will probably be going down for a couple days while I fix some problems with the backup system 
2018-11-28 04:58:16	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: The backup server hasn't been functioning correctly, meaning the minecraft server seems to be filling its had drive with backups, which, if left uncheck would probably lead to another crash and more data loss 
2018-11-28 05:00:46	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: So the server will be down until I can fix the backup system, which hopefully shouldn't take any longer than a couple days

2018-11-28 13:45:29	edwardthefma	Side perhaps you should use a backup plugin
2018-11-28 13:47:11	edwardthefma	Different backup plugin or use a python script to manually backup the world's 
2018-11-28 13:47:43	edwardthefma	That would abode the hassel

2018-11-28 14:23:51	@jan6	nah
2018-11-28 14:24:03	@jan6	it's very ez pz actually
2018-11-28 14:24:37	@jan6	cronjob to tar-gzip the directory, an scp it to a backup machine
2018-11-28 14:25:16	@jan6	the secondary machine can then upload to some service at a leisurely pace, if needed to
2018-11-28 14:33:02	edwardthefma	Jan6 can you wright a tutorial for sose

2018-11-28 14:55:40	sose	That's what I've been doing jan6 
2018-11-28 14:56:17	sose	The secondary machine has gone offline
2018-11-28 14:59:11	sose	Now that I think of it using git probably would've saved a bit of space
2018-11-28 14:59:21	@jan6	well, not exactly
2018-11-28 14:59:26	@jan6	but possibly
2018-11-28 15:00:14	sose	Anything delta based, but git just came to mind
2018-11-28 15:00:27	@jan6	git can use deltas, but it also stores ALL OF THE HISTORY FOREVER, so at a certain point you'd need to purge that
2018-11-28 15:01:44	sose	I thought the history was delta based as well?
2018-11-28 15:02:01	sose	As in "commit x added y lines to file z"
2018-11-28 15:02:21	~ben	it is
2018-11-28 15:02:56	@jan6	hm, then it's probably fine
2018-11-28 15:12:12	edwardthefma	Try to avoid doing anything that will mess with home data
2018-11-28 15:25:00	@jan6	eh, doesn't matter
2018-11-28 15:25:08	@jan6	if the world is gone, the homes are useless too
2018-11-28 15:25:22	@jan6	they're less important than the world itself imo
2018-11-28 15:25:52	@jan6	annoying, but nothing critical, it may take time to get back, but you're not losing anything
2018-11-28 16:10:03	edwardthefma	I was about to start in the new drowned farm
2018-11-28 16:10:10	edwardthefma	On the
2018-11-28 16:13:43	sose	I'm not going to touch the minecraft server edward
2018-11-28 16:14:21	sose	Just shutting it down for now so it doesn't create any more backups
2018-11-28 16:15:03	@jan6	how ofted do you bacup anywya?
2018-11-28 16:18:42	sose	Daily
2018-11-28 16:19:34	sose	Which hasn't been a problem since I've been putting them onto a server  with plenty of space
2018-11-28 16:24:46	@jan6	hm kay
2018-11-28 16:25:48	@jan6	I guess you can make bi-daily full backups and daily world (and inv) backups, though that won't save much anything, probably
2018-11-28 16:26:28	edwardthefma	Weekly backup
2018-11-28 16:26:50	@jan6	week's loss of building and farming is too big
2018-11-28 16:27:29	edwardthefma	Keep no more than 2 backups
2018-11-28 16:28:22	@jan6	kinda should do that tho ^
2018-11-28 16:28:32	edwardthefma	Deleate old backups to keep space for ever increasing world size
2018-11-28 16:28:53	@jan6	keep last 5 backups (by date), would be what I'd do, I guess
2018-11-28 16:29:39	edwardthefma	Do we keep any data in mysql
2018-11-28 16:29:46	@jan6	and every now and again manual backup that you keep forever
2018-11-28 16:29:52	@jan6	OF COURSE NOT
2018-11-28 16:29:59	edwardthefma	We need to
2018-11-28 16:30:06	@jan6	minecraft is not microsoftcraft YET
2018-11-28 16:30:21	@jan6	mysql and such stuff SUX
2018-11-28 16:30:59	@jan6	sqlite is fine, but NO server based ones, and also we have nothing to put there anyway
2018-11-28 16:31:31	edwardthefma	Keeping basic data like warp Pont's and homes
2018-11-28 16:31:37	@jan6	nay dood
2018-11-28 16:31:43	edwardthefma	And maby log block
2018-11-28 16:31:55	@jan6	also it's way more complicated than a regular backup
2018-11-28 16:32:15	@jan6	and takes more space and more maintenance and is more stuff to break
2018-11-28 16:32:30	edwardthefma	OK
2018-11-28 16:33:24	edwardthefma	I agree with you manual backups would be a good idea
2018-11-28 16:33:53	@jan6	or possibly automatic every week/month
2018-11-28 16:33:56	edwardthefma	Just copy and tar the server folder
2018-11-28 16:34:22	edwardthefma	Or connect to to a Google drive
2018-11-28 16:34:32	@jan6	weekly and monthly can be kept forever, daily ones not, probably delete last week's daily backups

2018-11-28 19:52:02	fosslinux	jan6, sose: i suggest keeping (this is what i nornally do); a week of dailys, a month of weeklys, a year of monthlys
2018-11-28 19:52:45	@jan6	^ḱinda like I was saying, but slightly better
2018-11-28 19:53:20	@jan6	monthlies can be infinitely stored tbh
2018-11-28 19:59:28	sose	I could try that
2018-11-28 19:59:35	sose	I still need a place to store them though
2018-11-28 19:59:49	sose	which is the big issue
2018-11-28 20:02:52	@jan6	well, google drive would technically work...
2018-11-28 20:03:08	@jan6	tarsnap might also work thoug it costs a little
2018-11-28 20:07:07	sose	What's the limit on a free gdrive?
2018-11-28 20:07:24	sose	we're talking multiple gigs per backup here
2018-11-28 20:08:42	@jan6	25 gigs per account
2018-11-28 20:08:52	@jan6	and you can have multiple accounts
2018-11-28 20:09:12	sose	Idk about multiple accounts
2018-11-28 20:09:29	sose	if this doesn't work out i'll just buy a droplet volume and stash them there
2018-11-28 20:11:46	sose	tarsnap is $.25/G/m while a droplet is 0.10

2018-11-28 20:20:05	edwardthefma	I have a new drowned grinder dezine I'm fixing to work in as soon as severs back up
2018-11-28 20:25:42	 *	jan6 thinks sose should just spin up a "nonbacked system" with a loud red warning of "no backups, if something breaks, it'll be reset, no guarantees given about anything"
2018-11-28 20:35:40	sose	yeah we could do that
2018-11-28 20:38:58	@jan6	and if backup gets working then keep it as normal server

2018-11-28 20:39:52	@jan6	btw if you were to register with nickserv and log in, then you could have auto-op on the channel, not that you'd need it
2018-11-28 20:41:15	@sose	I thought I did register?
2018-11-28 20:44:37	@sose	idk how to check that, i've got a little 'r' next to my name though
2018-11-28 20:44:39	@jan6	hm, ok then
2018-11-28 20:44:43	@jan6	then you did
2018-11-28 20:45:04	@jan6	you can ask ben to give channel ownership to you then
2018-11-28 20:45:19	@sose	@ben
2018-11-28 20:48:29	~ben	tarsnap compresses and dedupes
2018-11-28 20:48:47	~ben	it's almost certainly cheaper than a droplet
2018-11-28 20:48:53	~ben	wasabi might be worth a look
2018-11-28 20:49:06	@sose	not a droplet, just a volume
2018-11-28 20:49:14	~ben	still
2018-11-28 20:49:17	@sose	the server is alread hosted on a droplet
2018-11-28 20:49:38	~ben	tarsnap or wasabi

2018-11-28 20:51:48	~sose	wasabi seems significantly cheaper

2018-11-28 21:35:10	edwardthefma	I'm going to do ilmangos drowned farm its saposed to give 3 tridents perhour
2018-11-28 21:37:11	edwardthefma	If some one sits and grineds for 4 or 5 houses everybody could have a Trident
2018-11-28 21:57:10	@jan6	sure
2018-11-28 21:57:29	@jan6	all you need it to afk overnight, basically
2018-11-28 21:57:59	@jan6	one with a mending looting sword autoattacking, other just idling to spawn em in
2018-11-28 21:58:23	@jan6	else the entity cramming is gonna kill them which is fine I guess, tbh
2018-11-28 21:58:32	@jan6	just not AS effective
2018-11-28 22:22:50	edwardthefma	Jan6 have you ever heard of mine chat
2018-11-28 22:26:19	@jan6	yes
2018-11-28 22:27:01	@jan6	idk if it'll actually connect and just stand in place, or do something else though
2018-11-28 22:27:15	edwardthefma	It dose
2018-11-28 22:27:29	edwardthefma	Stands in place
2018-11-28 22:28:13	edwardthefma	I could use that to keep a chunk working at all times
2018-11-29 00:28:16	nilaky	jan6: im pretty sure i saw a thing - that drop rate only increased from like 8% to 11% with looting3
2018-11-29 00:29:45	nilaky	in my mind you make a doublechest for each stackable, feed the nonstackables into another doublechest, and chuck the rest of the loot? end up with bunch of tridents, fair number of other loot
2018-11-29 00:29:59	nilaky	doublechest of nautilus e.g. way too much, no way to use all that shit
2018-11-29 00:30:02	nilaky	:3
2018-11-29 06:00:41	@jan6|	nautilus is cool tho
2018-11-29 06:01:04	@jan6|	too bad can't be placed or compressed or really used much
2018-11-29 06:02:06	@jan6|	1 doublechest is ok, more is too much

2018-11-29 22:45:59	nilaky	how hard would it be to automate a server wipe
2018-11-29 22:46:21	nilaky	i am vaguely tempted to set up a vanilla server that wipes daily

2018-11-29 22:58:21	~sose	Oh yeah I was gonna do that at some point
2018-11-29 22:58:37	~sose	Server will probably be back up later today
2018-11-29 22:59:02	~sose	I didn't fix the backups, I'm probably just going to buy some storage
2018-11-29 23:26:04	edwardthefma	Sose I think we should do  server wipe for 1.14

2018-11-30 15:04:24	 *	jan6 just made "markers" with spawnegg work, one egg to create one to delete(in a radius of 1 block)
2018-11-30 15:05:21	@jan6	cool thing is that you can use spawn eggs to spawn literally any entity now (I'm spawning armorstands right now), with invisibility or armor or stuff
2018-11-30 15:05:45	@jan6	squid egg, spawns invisible armorstands, cool
2018-11-30 15:07:37	@jan6	the only flaw is that it'll only delete in straight lines, so diagonals are untouched, which is not ideal

2018-11-30 18:12:40	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: tif you could kill all the under sea plants that would be cool

2018-11-30 19:30:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	edwardthefma tried to swim in lava
2018-11-30 19:44:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	edwardthefma tried to swim in lava to escape Magma Cube
2018-11-30 19:44:30	@jan6	@riptide, btw, you can use it in the rain to FLY!
2018-11-30 19:44:55	@jan6	combine with elytra for a fun time
2018-11-30 19:46:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]edwardthefma: twe will need obcidean
2018-11-30 19:46:33	@jan6	use the end pillars
2018-11-30 19:47:16	@jan6	the end pillars are entirely obsidian, and will regenerate if you resummon the dragon, so in short, basically obsidian farm
2018-11-30 19:47:47	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]edwardthefma: tim on the nether side of the portal
2018-11-30 19:48:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]edwardthefma: twe need to make the portal bigger
2018-11-30 20:44:19	tildecraft_mc_bot	edwardthefma has disconnected
2018-11-30 22:29:36	nilaky	jan6: actually i already have used it to fly in the rain! turns out if you fly into a desert you can't riptide (cuz no rain) ... haven't tried it in the snow yet
2018-11-30 22:30:05	nilaky	it was SO AMAZING that I ended up putting mending on it and flying around pointlessly and trying to smack into vantablack >;3
2018-11-30 22:31:00	nilaky	here's a crazy thought: put up walls of water in the end so that if you miss an island, you can fly to the nearest waterfall and riptide your way back up. works without trident too, if you like swimming
2018-11-30 22:31:06	nilaky	idunno
2018-11-30 22:44:42	@jan6	'sure
2018-11-30 22:45:25	@jan6	just build waterbridges, if you slow down for too long you fall out of the world ;P
2018-11-30 22:58:33	edwardthefma	Sup all
2018-11-30 22:59:51	edwardthefma	nilaky I have the nether side almost done
2018-11-30 23:00:37	edwardthefma	I just need to make the portal bigger
2018-11-30 23:01:22	edwardthefma	and the grinder will be pritty much done
2018-11-30 23:12:15	nilaky	nice
2018-11-30 23:12:32	nilaky	maybe i can help gather some fuckloads of obsidian later tonight
2018-11-30 23:13:11	nilaky	I would totally like to fight the dragon myself
2018-11-30 23:13:22	nilaky	get some dragon breath n shito
2018-11-30 23:16:29	@jan6	hm, did you need da egg to respawn it or just the crystals?
2018-11-30 23:17:32	@jan6	anyway, I'm *thiiis close* to editing minecraft data files from the commandline, will continue after sleep, aye out!
2018-11-30 23:21:37	nilaky	niceee that's crazy!
2018-11-30 23:22:11	nilaky	looks like it's just the 4 crystals (ghast/blaze/enderman drops all it takes, who's got ghast tears, anyone?)
2018-11-30 23:22:27	nilaky	we have blaze farms and the end is ezpz
2018-11-30 23:22:34	nilaky	so ghast tears are gonna be the tough bit
2018-11-30 23:23:03	nilaky	it's tempting to haul a fuckload of lava out of the nether with buckets/shulker boxes, to clear a giant empty area for spawning ghasts

2018-12-01 00:10:46	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_nether]edwardthefma: fixing to grind drowneds
2018-12-01 00:10:58	fosslinux	but why are you in the nether

2018-12-01 00:20:40	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: next thing to do is make a afk room
2018-12-01 00:24:32	nilaky	fosslinux: it's pretty close to this grinder, more or less: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsGpEx1Ya2o
2018-12-01 00:24:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: we need sose to make 2 warps

2018-12-01 00:27:15	nilaky	sose: is the setwarp plugin available somewhere? I'm curious to see if I could add a feature: you can create/edit your own warps, but cannot delete someone else's unless you're a server mod
2018-12-01 00:27:50	nilaky	this would make it safe to expose to non-mods since it would be just like /sethome + /tpask mods combined

2018-12-01 00:30:01	nilaky	what do you mean? the afk room for the mob grinder needs to be floating in the air so that only drowned in the water are loaded and able to move, to improve rates
2018-12-01 00:30:34	nilaky	oh i see what you mean
2018-12-01 00:31:02	nilaky	i still think the /sethome or /setwarp idea i had would be the way to go
2018-12-01 00:31:14	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: what idea?
2018-12-01 00:31:31	nilaky	cuz i mean, we already have a bunch of public areas we could totally use some kind of warp system to get to

2018-12-01 01:10:43	nilaky	saplings: you dont get those with shears, and if you pop all the wood, the leaves will slowly decay... this treecapitator plugin kinda pisses me off tbh, that it doesn't go diagonally to get all of em, nor shut itself off while holding shift... good features, those
2018-12-01 01:11:32	nilaky	sose: can you link that plugin on github too? i'm tempted to add the shift-to-ignore feature to it

2018-12-01 03:37:20	fosslinux	would i be right in saying that you can farm it using nether portals???
2018-12-01 03:37:27	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: you can but eugh
2018-12-01 03:37:28	@khuxkm|lounge	I have a little under 18 stacks of magma blocks

2018-12-01 03:37:50	@khuxkm|lounge	end is easier to use wrt farming obsidian
2018-12-01 03:37:56	fosslinux	next time someone goes to the end mine obsidian
2018-12-01 03:37:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: or use the dynamic map to find 2 pools of lava
2018-12-01 03:38:00	@khuxkm|lounge	especially when you get higher-tier gear
2018-12-01 03:38:05	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i only had to mine out 2 pools for 2 stax
2018-12-01 03:38:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: whats high tier gear? :p
2018-12-01 03:38:17	@khuxkm|lounge	mine down all of the obsidian pillars after defeating ender dragon
2018-12-01 03:38:23	fosslinux	^
2018-12-01 03:38:24	@khuxkm|lounge	like good enchanted diamond gear
2018-12-01 03:38:29	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: im still working on getting protection V on all my diamond armor
2018-12-01 03:38:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i got mending on everything already
2018-12-01 03:38:34	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-01 03:38:41	@khuxkm|lounge	then when you respawn the dragon it'll respawn the pillars
2018-12-01 03:38:44	@khuxkm|lounge	defeat dragon again
2018-12-01 03:38:48	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yeah im tempted to do it
2018-12-01 03:38:55	fosslinux	do we have enchantment books in the vault
2018-12-01 03:38:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: just wanted to hit a couple pools first
2018-12-01 03:39:04	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: nah, fishing farm
2018-12-01 03:39:06	@khuxkm|lounge	the only time i've really used dragon rematches is to farm dragon's breath on a modded 1.12.2 server
2018-12-01 03:39:10	@khuxkm|lounge	which is kinda sad
2018-12-01 03:39:23	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: i built a sorter in the fishing farm, same as the vault
2018-12-01 03:39:33	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: need more ghast tears, 4 per dragon
2018-12-01 03:39:37	fosslinux	how many times have we responed the dragon?
2018-12-01 03:39:42	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: prob 0
2018-12-01 03:40:01	fosslinux	ok
2018-12-01 03:40:13	fosslinux	because you can only respawn it a max of 20 itmes i think
2018-12-01 03:40:20	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: dafuq
2018-12-01 03:40:23	fosslinux	so basically use each one carefully
2018-12-01 03:40:42	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: what do you mean only 20x
2018-12-01 03:40:43	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: why
2018-12-01 03:41:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: Every dragon kill will also create an End gateway portal within 75-100 blocks of the exit portal, up to a maximum of 20.
2018-12-01 03:41:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: that doesn't mean you can't keep mining obsidian
2018-12-01 03:41:27	@khuxkm	so max 20 end portals
2018-12-01 03:41:33	@khuxkm	s/end/gateway
2018-12-01 03:41:33	sedbot	<khuxkm> so max 20 gateway portals
2018-12-01 03:41:34	fosslinux	i thought i read that somewhere
2018-12-01 03:41:53	fosslinux	nvm
2018-12-01 03:42:02	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]Nilaky: yeah but the gateways are useless cuz of rtp and tp/home/spawn commands <3
2018-12-01 03:43:33	edwardthefma	I wander how long you needs to stand in the grinder before we get shit tones of drowneds
2018-12-01 03:44:01	fosslinux	you need to not sleep
2018-12-01 03:44:12	@khuxkm|lounge	so keep a bed down there
2018-12-01 03:44:15	@khuxkm|lounge	and sleep post-grind

2018-12-01 21:32:17	@jan6	idk what option it is that sose hasn't enabled, but /back ONLY teleports back to last TELEPORTED location, NOT death location, which sux for sure, buuut you have unlimited time to recover the stuff

2018-12-02 19:46:44	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]dozens: should probably build one by spawn
2018-12-02 19:47:01	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]dozens: but it would probably fuck up everybody's portals
2018-12-02 19:47:22	@jan6	why so?
2018-12-02 19:47:34	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]dozens: because of all the portals is requires
2018-12-02 19:48:04	@jan6	afai if you have exactly positioned portals, all should be fine? as in, if you have a portal at X and in nether at X*8 then it shouldn't ever unlink?

2018-12-02 19:48:44	fosslinux	jan6: wouldnt it be X and Z and in nether at X*8 and Z*8
2018-12-02 19:48:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]dozens: you'd have to be even MORE exact and include the y coord
2018-12-02 19:49:04	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]dozens: x/8, y, z/8
2018-12-02 19:49:08	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]dozens: which is a pain
2018-12-02 19:49:19	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]dozens: that's why my portal in the nether is ground level
2018-12-02 19:49:21	fosslinux	what you have to have correct y?

2018-12-02 21:15:27	@jan6	^
2018-12-02 21:16:25	@jan6	same with disconnects, though those are probably less than deaths and less interesting (easy to have poor net, hard to accidentally keep dying)
2018-12-02 21:17:05	edwardthefma	Nilaky we need to light up caves near the grinder
2018-12-02 21:17:23	@jan6	or just flood them
2018-12-02 21:17:43	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: just tame a regular horse steve

2018-12-02 21:19:54	@jan6	most wifi routers have ports for normal cables on the back, and you can run the wire along corners so it's not a hassle
2018-12-02 21:19:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]neufv: finally moved my entire storage into ender chest
2018-12-02 21:19:58	@jan6	well, lol
2018-12-02 21:20:11	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: more of a hassle than constantly disconnecting? lol
2018-12-02 21:20:14	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]neufv: feel like i can finally start the game lol
2018-12-02 21:20:15	@jan6	is having 20 disconnects a day BETTER than dealing with a cable?
2018-12-02 21:20:47	@jan6	I suspect you could shave off a couple deaths with it too
2018-12-02 21:20:49	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: congrats neufv
2018-12-02 21:21:03	@jan6	yeah, congrats on having basically no inventory ;P

2018-12-04 20:51:22	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: vantablack oh and one more at -113 64 -213 
2018-12-04 20:51:50	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: that's x,y,z btw 
2018-12-04 20:57:04	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: There seems to be quite a few chests in there, since griefing is off I think ill just dump the db file 
2018-12-04 20:59:29	@jan6	just find ALL death chests, cause why not, maybe somebody else has lost theirs too
2018-12-04 21:01:07	nilaky	sose: can you automate death chest dumps to the webpage? would be awesome, cuz there's 2 stuck in the mob grinder, and we can never move them sooo ...
2018-12-04 21:02:21	nilaky	it would be kinda hilarious if we could have a graveyard, and every week or so, all death chests migrated to the graveyard and got headstones :p
2018-12-04 21:07:58	@jan6	^
2018-12-04 21:08:43	@jan6	paths of mycelium, graves of podzol
2018-12-04 21:47:03	nilaky	so like a grid of 1-wide mycelium with 2x2 plots int the middle, podzol raised up and an exposed chest/double flush with the ground, and a sign against the podzol if there's items in the chest? seems legit
2018-12-04 21:47:26	nilaky	when i get on i can terraform over by the library and set that up i think
2018-12-04 21:47:52	nilaky	i might need to farm some more mycelium from dirt (im not terraforming the shroom island, i already grabbed a few blocks
2018-12-04 21:51:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: that's quite involved actually 
2018-12-04 21:52:11	@jan6	I was thinking of more buried kind, but if aboveground, just have "anonymous" signs ;P
2018-12-04 21:52:56	@jan6	so you'll have to go through the graveyard till you find yours
2018-12-04 21:53:51	@jan6	the long-standing ones can be identified by players
2018-12-04 21:53:53	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: that sounds great for a super hard survival story mode or something, but for ease of use, just put signs of who died and when/where 
2018-12-04 21:54:23	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: ? i mean you can't tell whose death chest you've found, and if the owner shows up, poof, it's gone 
2018-12-04 21:54:40	@jan6	^
2018-12-04 21:54:46	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: sose: what do you mean? i'm curious if you'd give me access to the minecraft server to try n automate it lol 
2018-12-04 21:55:09	@jan6	have you tried stick-clicking the chest though, ever? i haven't but maybe it shows
2018-12-04 21:55:11	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: crontabs ezpz, db dumps ezpz 
2018-12-04 21:55:21	nilaky	oh interesting, no hadnt tried
2018-12-04 21:55:26	@jan6	nilaky: better do it on your local computer, lol
2018-12-04 21:56:07	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: my local computer doesn't have access to the db file that stores death chests, i don't understand your comment at all 
2018-12-04 21:56:12	@jan6	I'm sure sos€ would give you a copy of the files, but proobably not good to test stuff directly on the server if it's of ambition like this
2018-12-04 21:56:39	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: you've gotta get the coords from the sqlite db, then since the db uses uuids instead of usernames you'd need to extract those from the userlist, then put those together in some sort of intermediate format (probably json), then finally convert that to html 
2018-12-04 21:56:51	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: and of course have a way to automate it 
2018-12-04 21:57:43	@jan6	sqlite, ezpz
2018-12-04 21:57:55	@jan6	uuid, also quite easy
2018-12-04 21:58:12	@jan6	just have an autoupdating list of the uuid - name pairs
2018-12-04 21:58:14	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: a bit of work, but i'm kinda busy right now 
2018-12-04 21:58:24	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: i'll link the stuff for you guys though 
2018-12-04 21:58:28	@jan6	no ned for json, yugh
2018-12-04 21:58:46	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: sose: if you could put a copy of the death chest db in your homedir on tilde.town, and a location, i can make a thing real ez 
2018-12-04 21:58:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: sose: that sounds real easy 
2018-12-04 21:59:32	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: sose: can you get me a copy of the relevant db files? this is the sort of thing i kind of do for fun at work, all the time 
2018-12-04 21:59:33	@jan6	export sqlite as html (I've done it before once), and just replace each uuid using something like sed
2018-12-04 22:00:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~vantablack@tilde.town: thanks sose :D 
2018-12-04 22:00:20	@jan6	everything except for the username-uuid list can be done in a oneliner, lol
2018-12-04 22:00:51	nilaky	jan6: be ambitious, technically you could do all of this in a oneliner
2018-12-04 22:01:02	@jan6	weeeeel
2018-12-04 22:01:23	@jan6	TECHNICALLY you could fit the entirety of linux kernel into a oneliner
2018-12-04 22:01:36	@jan6	in one file
2018-12-04 22:01:43	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~vantablack@tilde.town: hey who wants to help me find my death chests lol 
2018-12-04 22:02:02	@jan6	vanta, you already KNOW their location

2018-12-04 22:17:48	nilaky	jan6: there we go, it dumps the deathchests.db, dumps the usercache.json and transforms them both into a useful form, smashes them together, and featherdusts it with an html table for half-assed beautification

2018-12-04 23:04:34	nilaky	lol i think it's locked down by dozens, it's in a protected area
2018-12-04 23:04:38	@jan6	you can tell me where it is sometime, right now I'm sleeping
2018-12-04 23:04:38	nilaky	which is ... hm

2018-12-04 23:04:54	nilaky	well also you can get 8 blocks of gold from each ocean temple you clear
2018-12-04 23:05:16	nilaky	the vault has a few stacks of gold ore and iron ore from my adventures
2018-12-04 23:05:21	@jan6	also, I already suggested, if you don't like stealing, then put half loot in protected area, rest accessible, and allow mob killing, free loot!
2018-12-04 23:05:43	nilaky	yeah idk why dozens protected just the gold farm, it seems accidental or something
2018-12-04 23:05:48	@jan6	@dozens and stuff
2018-12-04 23:06:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: it was intentional lol

2018-12-04 23:23:03	nilaky	rabbit stew gives the most food points, and is pretty close to best saturation, so pretty good if you survive with 1 heart and are almost starved, one of those might full heal you or something

2018-12-06 14:13:02	@jan6	NOT a proper quit
2018-12-06 14:13:34	@jan6	also had no idea the server went down that often
2018-12-06 14:15:53	~sose	Sometimes it does timeout because of ping pong stuff
2018-12-06 14:16:04	~sose	But this time it was the server
2018-12-06 14:16:09	@jan6	ok
2018-12-06 14:16:39	~sose	I have no idea what would be causing it though, since usually it pings and pong fine
2018-12-06 14:20:13	@jan6	it sure seems to be a little sketchy (sometimes non-chat messages go through, usually only partially, and stuff) in general, I'd make it log everything except for message contents, I guess (to keep the log manageable, something like "sent message to irc" is fine, just not "jan6: ahoy m'dudes" in the log)
2018-12-06 14:42:41	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: The non chat messages are from when the server restarts 
2018-12-06 14:43:26	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~sose@tilde.town: I just set it to send through anything  starting with a '>' so that broadcast messages can go through

2018-12-07 00:18:26	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_creative]neufv: i'm doing tests for an automated railway
2018-12-07 00:18:50	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_creative]neufv: that can stop at stations for a few seconds and then automatically continue
2018-12-07 00:19:45	edwardthefma	Cool
2018-12-07 00:30:27	nilaky	here's a thought: kick the person out of the minecart and send it back to its usual holding zone. this way even after 5 people take the same path, the carts reset
2018-12-07 00:30:44	nilaky	possibly possible to automate this to support multiple carts too
2018-12-07 00:30:54	nilaky	interesting project idea either way

2018-12-07 03:34:12	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_creative]neufv: should i just start adding the blue and red to the current entrances? or is that a terrible idea?
2018-12-07 03:34:29	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_creative]~vantablack: we should get more opinions first
2018-12-07 03:34:44	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_creative]neufv: alright

2018-12-07 18:59:54	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: but yeah uh vantablack the chickenspam is extremely frustrating when working on something. if you were making a redstone contraption to fire them that's kinda cool, but dropping them right in front of someone's project is ... :/ 
2018-12-07 19:00:36	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: (the contraption is called a dispenser, lol)
2018-12-07 19:01:07	nilaky	the contraption is called a dispenser and a bunch of sticky pistons in a flying machine shaped like a chicken
2018-12-07 19:01:19	nilaky	creativity is good, nuisance is questionable
2018-12-07 19:01:25	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]jan69: 
2018-12-07 19:02:10	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~jan6: hm, just noticed my nick got unset for some reason some time back

2018-12-07 19:38:45	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: also have you seen chicken hunting minigames? they're pretty cool 
2018-12-07 19:38:55	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~nilaky@tilde.town: dispense chickens randomly and try to shoot them before they hit the lava 
2018-12-07 19:39:42	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: if you think that's hard, try killing some rabbits in open space without a bow ;P
2018-12-07 19:43:02	nilaky	yeah lol
2018-12-07 19:43:39	nilaky	i kind of want to create some kind of rabbit hunting minigame using withers??
2018-12-07 19:43:47	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: withers?
2018-12-07 19:44:37	nilaky	honest question: are you not familiar with every mob in the game? I've forgotten again cuz you're in here so often
2018-12-07 19:45:42	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: i kinda know 'em, just wondering why withers? "kill the most before you wither away?"
2018-12-07 19:45:44	nilaky	https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wither it's kind of one of the most difficult bosses in the game, personally i find them harder to kill than the dragon because they fly and spew explosives nonstop and they destroy blocks and aggro against all other mobs, and they apply a debuff that saps so much health
2018-12-07 19:45:53	nilaky	naw, like a creative minigame
2018-12-07 19:45:54	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: welllllllll
2018-12-07 19:46:09	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: creative you fly superfast
2018-12-07 19:46:11	nilaky	like you spam bunnies to try and get your wither to a finish line first idk
2018-12-07 19:46:20	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: hmm
2018-12-07 19:46:33	nilaky	yes but the wither has so much life, it took ages to spam potions to kill it completely
2018-12-07 19:46:37	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: possibly, feel free to try a prototype somewhere
2018-12-07 19:46:45	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: the trick is to trap the wither, lol
2018-12-07 19:46:51	nilaky	i spawned 8 withers in superflat, it took like 2 hours to kill them all
2018-12-07 19:46:54	nilaky	and we missed one lmao
2018-12-07 19:47:14	nilaky	i forgot to check if we have commandblocks >.>
2018-12-07 19:47:21	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: ?
2018-12-07 19:47:37	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: you need commands and we don't have no vanilla commands
2018-12-07 19:47:44	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: acces to any*
2018-12-07 19:48:16	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: you can't /give them, so we can't get them, sadly
2018-12-07 19:48:29	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: well, *WE* can't /give them
2018-12-07 20:09:32	@khuxkm|lounge	nilaky: you trap it in the nether ceiling
2018-12-07 20:09:34	@khuxkm|lounge	:P
2018-12-07 20:12:33	@jan6	14:46:45  tildecraft_mc_bot | [world_superflat]~yan6: the trick is to trap the wither, lol
2018-12-07 21:02:00	nilaky	yeah i've heard, i haven't tried it yet but I've seen someone do it before
2018-12-07 21:02:24	nilaky	huh i used to think commandblocks were available through creative inv
2018-12-07 21:02:31	nilaky	fair enough i guess
2018-12-07 21:02:33	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: never were
2018-12-07 21:02:41	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: have to /give them
2018-12-07 21:02:47	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: like structure blocks
2018-12-07 21:02:51	nilaky	well i think sponges used to be the same but they eventually added them
2018-12-07 21:02:56	nilaky	i haven't been 100% the most attentive idk
2018-12-07 21:03:06	nilaky	i'll /give you a good time bby
2018-12-07 21:03:07	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world_superflat]~yan6: structure blocks are awesome

2018-12-10 21:08:02	edwardthefma	I set up a golem and it didn't spawn
2018-12-10 21:08:33	edwardthefma	Probably because of the red carpet
2018-12-10 21:09:59	@jan6	well
2018-12-10 21:10:21	@jan6	afaik golems will spawn no matter what if they have enough space, and you build properly ;P

2018-12-10 21:10:57	@jan6	if the carpets were solid blocks, would the golem fit in there? if not then there's your problem
2018-12-10 21:11:58	@jan6	but just a 3x3x3 clean area around the middle of the golem statue should guarantee success, also, of course you need to place pumpkin last if not already

2018-12-10 21:49:57	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: also you should look into getting full diamond armor
2018-12-10 21:50:03	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: you'd die a lot less

2018-12-10 21:55:14	nilaky	no i do not have diamond armor and i'm honestly not comfortable giving full diamond armor to someone who isn't going to take care of it
2018-12-10 21:55:52	nilaky	i mean, it's there to be used but it freaks me out seeing edwardthefma dying so frequently and thinking about how much durability is going to use
2018-12-10 21:56:14	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]~vantablack: thanks :D
2018-12-10 21:56:52	nilaky	i mean if you want to create 1 set of diamond armor, fine, but if you lose it, please do not replace it with diamonds from the vault
2018-12-10 21:57:01	nilaky	that's all i am asking really

2018-12-12 21:21:27	@jan6	all you need is glass surrounding you, and bom

2018-12-12 21:22:35	@jan6	if you just wanted to kill them you could just use a toggleable lava trap too, which has the bonus of cooking all the meat
2018-12-12 21:22:42	@jan6	they power the killing, of course
2018-12-12 21:45:33	nilaky	jan6: lol what
2018-12-12 21:46:26	nilaky	I'm confused, you stand in a glass box and phantoms swarm you, then die in the sun, what is this powering?
2018-12-12 21:46:43	nilaky	phantom membranes don't do anything but repair elytra right?
2018-12-12 21:46:57	nilaky	and phantoms don't attack or trigger most stuff right
2018-12-12 21:47:14	nilaky	so what on earth are you talking about "cooking all the meat" ... from phantoms?
2018-12-12 21:47:30	nilaky	if you're talking about a cow farm, i don't know how a phantom helps

2018-12-12 21:51:25	nilaky	jan6: what I'm missing is, how are phantoms dealing damage to anything they're not aggro'd on
2018-12-12 21:51:38	nilaky	zombies do not accidentally attack anything, they only aggro to skeletons if shot first
2018-12-12 21:52:45	nilaky	my understanding is that used to be "all melee attacking mobs do not accidentally hit anything but players"
2018-12-12 21:53:22	nilaky	I haven't checked if that changed with phantoms, but I'd hit X to doubt it based on history?

2018-12-12 22:01:52	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: I mean, the plan is to have them aggro you but hit mobs on their way

2018-12-12 22:07:02	nilaky	it's a good desire, but I think you'd be better off using skeletons with a water curtain to stop the arrows before they hit you. it's a way to farm records, etc
2018-12-12 22:10:56	nilaky	Here's a farm using an iron golem to draw skeleton fire, and water to catch the arrows, and falling sand to reduce lag from arrow entities

2018-12-12 22:14:28	@jan6	or anything other than creepers, for tha tmatteR?
2018-12-12 22:18:07	nilaky	[using mob aggro to kill other mobs] is a good desire, but I think you'd be better off using skeletons [for farming cows and pigs]. [using skeletons in general] is a way to farm records [when the farm spawns creepers]
2018-12-12 22:18:34	nilaky	you can question what i was saying, but you already extracted every bit of info there was to get out of my message
2018-12-12 22:18:39	nilaky	:3
2018-12-12 22:19:32	nilaky	i linked to a creeper farm video, but the killing chamber only requires that skeletons be able to see a golem, and the mob fits within their firing range
2018-12-12 22:20:25	nilaky	you can use multiple skeletons to widen their aim, i'm pretty sure cows are tall enough to be hit by the arrows at the usual skele angle, but perhaps playing with the distance and angle of the iron golem could also affect the skeleton shots
2018-12-12 22:20:45	nilaky	cuz creepers fit in a 1x1 area, but cows may be more tricky
2018-12-12 22:23:50	edwardthefma	The vindacatior named Johnny can 1 hit kill a cow
2018-12-12 22:29:29	nilaky	Johnny Johnny, yes stevie? killing cows? no stevie. telling lies? no stevie. open your inventory? ha. ha. ha.
2018-12-12 22:32:28	@jan6	nilaky, why're you all of a sudden talking about record farms anyway?
2018-12-12 22:32:42	@jan6	nobody has even mentioned creepers, lest alone records, afaik

2018-12-12 23:32:50	nilaky	jan6: this feels like you're attacking my idea and me for suggesting it, I recommend you re-read my message and try to phrase this more politely
2018-12-12 23:33:00	tildecraft_mc_bot	[world]edwardthefma: i have had sevrel times connecting only to be dissconnected

2018-12-12 23:33:51	nilaky	jan6: why're you all of a sudden talking about phantoms anyway?
2018-12-12 23:34:00	nilaky	nobody has even mentioned phantoms, until you did
2018-12-12 23:36:05	nilaky	i assume we were both doing the same thing: suggesting a related idea for how to farm cows. you understand my idea to use skeletons, but you're completely fixated on the fact that I said the word record. I've already explained multiple times, but here goes again
2018-12-12 23:37:43	nilaky	a record farm has two distinct modules: a creeper spawning module, and a skeleton-killing-mobs module. If you build the creeper module alone, you still get creepers. If you build the skeleton module alone, you still get a skeleton firing arrows through a space constantly.
2018-12-12 23:38:26	nilaky	If you put the cow breeding module from the vindicator farm feeding into the skeleton-killing-mobs module, you now have skeletons killing cows, and maybe firing through lava will set their arrows on fire, who knows.
2018-12-12 23:40:00	nilaky	yes i fucking mentioned record farms, because that was where i had seen it done, and i provided a link to a record farm which has the skeleton module. note that i clarified this when you expressed confusion: "[using skeletons in general] is a way to farm records [when the farm spawns creepers]"
2018-12-12 23:40:31	nilaky	how many pages of text do you need to explain "I found a thing that does X, maybe it can do Y" "WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT X?!? NOBODY MENTIONED X"
2018-12-12 23:57:11	nilaky	jan6: I'm sorry I'm being like this, and I'm sorry I haven't found a way to stop
2018-12-12 23:57:26	nilaky	I'm sort of feeling like maybe I should stop chatting or something

2018-12-15 20:52:50	fosslinux	hard to break
2018-12-15 20:53:11	fosslinux	and they can't enforce the laws on tor easily

2018-12-15 20:53:53	fosslinux	because someone with commit access woudl have to be an aus citizen
2018-12-15 20:53:54	@jan6	just "you have to give us a way in no matter what"
2018-12-15 20:54:04	fosslinux	+ then people would notice
2018-12-15 20:54:19	fosslinux	thats the thing with this law and oss - people would notice that backdoors have been implemented
2018-12-15 20:54:27	@jan6	yeah
2018-12-15 20:55:06	@jan6	but y'know, they can demand access to data of aus ip range 
2018-12-15 20:55:29	fosslinux	demand to who?
2018-12-15 20:55:34	@jan6	everyone
2018-12-15 20:55:55	@jan6	but in practice probably only big enough stuff that they have an excuse for
2018-12-15 20:55:57	fosslinux	data of aus ip range from tor?
2018-12-15 20:56:08	fosslinux	only if a tor developer is an aus citizen
2018-12-15 20:57:08	@jan6	but hm, define encryption, really
2018-12-15 20:57:43	@jan6	if I base64 something, is it encrypted? but aes256? where's the difference?
2018-12-15 20:58:10	@jan6	if I create a custom data format, is that "encryption"?
2018-12-15 20:59:22	@jan6	is shifting the message's bytes by one bit encryption? but if I shift 10000 times into certain directions determined by a "seed"?

2018-12-18 22:14:30	nilaky	fosslinux: the laziest hack to make a cobblestone building look nice is to use smooth stone or bricks, or to replace the corners with logs
2018-12-18 22:14:49	nilaky	if you replace three blocks per corner, the decor will look nice inside as well
2018-12-18 22:28:59	tildecraft_mc_bot	IRC > ~jan6@tilde.town: also, andersite and smooth stone mix real well (especially with polished andersite), unpolished is OK with cobble too
