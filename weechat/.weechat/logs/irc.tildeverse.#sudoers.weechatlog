2018-11-26 19:17:18	@khuxkm	so I could refer to minerbot code in chat
2018-11-26 19:19:12	aewens	Hmm, okay then. I like how it goes through the process of including Lua into it, then proceeds to have the Lua handler commented out.
2018-11-26 19:19:30	aewens	Same with the xkcd handler.
2018-11-26 19:19:37	@khuxkm	that's because the lua handler is borked
2018-11-26 19:19:48	@khuxkm	and I never finished the xkcd handler and it was making it crash

2018-11-28 20:14:00	aewens	Formal complaint that 1000.directory is not listed on https://tilde.team/wiki/?page=other-tildes
2018-11-28 20:40:21	jan6	is it a tilde tho?
2018-11-28 20:40:31	jan6	also iirc it's being phased out?
2018-11-28 20:40:42	jan6	in favour of somehting else
2018-11-28 20:42:48	aewens	He advertised it to others as a tilde, but if he's phasing it out then I'll postpone my complaint for later xD
2018-11-28 20:44:09	jan6	idk, nothing I ever say is a fact
2018-11-28 20:51:06	sebboh	facts are those things which may be true or false.  So you put yourself in a weird position with that last message jan6. :)
2018-11-28 20:51:43	jan6	fact is, there are no facts
2018-11-28 20:55:23	~ben	send a PR 
2018-11-28 20:55:37	~ben	arne: is 1000.directory a thign?
2018-11-28 20:55:46	~ben	should probably add tilde.institute
2018-11-28 21:04:21	sebboh	most people who say there are no facts mean there are no truths.  If you're making a subtle, aware distinction there, do tell!
2018-11-28 21:17:27	jan6	wrong channel for this kind of discussion anyway, but everything's relative, and everything's possible
2018-11-29 13:02:04	arne	ben 1000.directory is still a thing
2018-11-29 13:02:13	arne	only needs a bit of maintainance

2018-12-03 04:59:02	~ben	if you named it something other than the default, you'll have to use the -i parameter of ssh

2018-12-12 22:41:46	~ben	we don't have anything like that afaik
2018-12-13 01:37:59	@cmccabe	let me make some time to look into it and install it. i'll also check if there are alternatives.  i believe pisg is a bit old.
2018-12-13 01:38:46	~ben	ok cool :)
2018-12-13 01:39:05	~ben	if you need help with nginx or anything, holler and we can hop on a shared tmux/byobu thingy
2018-12-13 03:06:43	@cmccabe	ok
2018-12-13 03:07:50	~ben	if you need logs, i can send you some from my weechat (but i'm guessing you have as much as i do in your weechat)
2018-12-13 03:16:19	@cmccabe	yeah, i should have enough for a proof of concept.  if it works, i guess we set uo a dedicated account for logging?
2018-12-13 03:23:08	~ben	yeah we can do that
2018-12-13 03:23:18	~ben	could put something on the https://tilde.chat site
2018-12-13 03:23:25	~ben	and/or tilde.team site
2018-12-13 03:23:42	~ben	there are a couple things that i run under the services user
2018-12-13 03:26:44	@cmccabe	ok. i'll dig in and then discuss with you before finalizing anything
2018-12-13 03:27:37	~ben	good deal :)
2018-12-13 03:27:45	~ben	and it will analyze post logs too?
2018-12-13 03:54:52	@cmccabe	what do you mean by post logs?
2018-12-13 03:55:52	~ben	chat history
2018-12-13 03:56:04	~ben	rather than processing anything that comes in after you start it up
2018-12-13 11:30:15	@cmccabe	ben: sorry i got ctrl-zzz'ed.  yes, i am quite sure it processes historical logs.

2018-12-14 21:56:09	sebboh	on 2018Dec13 my IRC connection to EFnet dropped and weechat auto-reconnected.  The server said:
2018-12-14 21:56:54	sebboh	You are now being scanned for open proxies by the irc.mzima.net local and EFNet global open proxy monitors.
2018-12-14 21:57:31	sebboh	You are banned from this server- Temporary K-line 14400 min. - (r62/10) please use another server (2018/12/13 07.09)
2018-12-14 21:58:22	sebboh	I'm not sure what their "proxy scan" consists off...  Are any of our users running any such thing?
2018-12-14 22:08:55	~ben	not that i know of
2018-12-14 22:09:27	~ben	not sure what that means
2018-12-14 22:12:19	~ben	open proxies?
2018-12-14 22:24:58	sebboh	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_proxy
2018-12-14 22:42:07	fosslinux	hmmm
2018-12-14 22:42:41	fosslinux	well we have users ssh tunnelling sebboh would that count?
2018-12-14 22:56:56	jan6	nah
2018-12-14 22:57:56	jan6	I'm pretty sure that they're just checking for public proxies, that someone might be using to circumvent their punishments (one ip banned, move to next one)
2018-12-14 22:58:54	jan6	it is possible they've detected several users from our IP, and flagged it as one, too
2018-12-14 23:00:11	jan6	I'd say, worth a shot to join from your own ip, and ask in the admin-help-room or something, nothing to lose from it, after all
2018-12-15 00:10:40	~ben	hmm could be something like that
2018-12-15 21:20:48	@khuxkm|lounge	irc.underworld.no works for me
2018-12-15 21:20:55	@khuxkm|lounge	(wrt EFNet)

2018-12-17 19:52:10	sebboh	Well, based on my experience, it's most likely that our IP was running an open proxy.  It aligns with what the server said.
2018-12-17 19:52:25	sebboh	khuxkm|lounge: thanks
2018-12-17 19:53:27	~ben	not that i'm aware of :o
2018-12-17 19:53:49	jan6	open proxy as in allowing anyone to use this box as an intermediary to connect to their irc ;P
2018-12-17 19:54:03	~ben	that doesn't count afaik
2018-12-17 19:54:13	jan6	you can talk to them to get it whitelisted, probably, I bet it's just automated script
2018-12-17 19:54:14	sebboh	jan6, but ssh wouldn't be automatically detected.
2018-12-17 19:54:19	jan6	ssh, not
2018-12-17 19:54:21	jan6	ip, yes
2018-12-17 19:55:24	fosslinux	yessss.
2018-12-17 19:57:16	jan6	pretty sure they just scan for "multiple users form same ip on at same time, and not within known dynamic ip ranges"
2018-12-17 19:57:24	jan6	s/or/ro/
2018-12-17 19:57:24	sedbot	<jan6> pretty sure they just scan fro "multiple users form same ip on at same time, and not within known dynamic ip ranges"
2018-12-17 19:57:31	jan6	s/or/ro/g
2018-12-17 19:57:31	sedbot	<jan6> pretty sure they just scan fro "multiple users from same ip on at same time, and not within known dynamic ip ranges"
2018-12-17 19:57:31	~ben	i submitted a request to increase our allowed connections to freenode
2018-12-17 19:57:35	sebboh	so... I'm not going to go ask an EFnet oper a question.  Not even "how's it going?". :) like.. those people are the crazy homeless veterans of the internet. :P
2018-12-17 19:57:47	~ben	and also requested a proper group registration for #tilde.team
2018-12-17 19:57:55	jan6	lol, sebboh, really?
2018-12-17 19:58:09	jan6	proper group?
2018-12-17 19:58:36	sebboh	veterans like... "I SEEN STUFF IN THE JUNGLE, MAAAAN!"
2018-12-17 20:00:24	~ben	jan6: https://freenode.net/groupreg
2018-12-17 20:10:22	jan6	"Group hostname cloaks. Cloaks allow your project or organisation to grant official recognition to project participants. Your group contact maintains this cloak list."
2018-12-17 20:10:55	jan6	so, does freenode approve a list you give them, and group admins can distribute them?
2018-12-17 20:14:30	~ben	yeah i would do that
