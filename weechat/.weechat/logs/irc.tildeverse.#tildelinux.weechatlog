2018-11-14 02:16:15	~ben	hm?
2018-11-14 02:16:57	sose	I didn't realize that everything was on here, not tilde.chat
2018-11-14 02:17:11	~ben	same machine :x
2018-11-14 02:17:26	~ben	a lot of tildeverse services run on there as well
2018-11-14 02:17:28	~ben	SPOF
2018-11-14 02:17:49	sose	Connecting to tilde.chat from town gives me a different server I mean
2018-11-14 02:20:11	~ben	shouldn't
2018-11-14 02:20:19	~ben	same network
2018-11-14 02:20:31	~ben	if you connect from town it should be localhost port 7766
2018-11-14 02:20:41	~ben	otherwise tilde.chat port 6697
2018-11-14 02:24:27	sose	yeah I tried localhost 7766
2018-11-14 02:24:38	sose	puts me on a different server
2018-11-14 02:24:46	sose	maybe something on vil's end?
2018-11-14 02:25:39	sose	aliassless, login, troido and nilaky are all on there I think
2018-11-14 02:26:08	sose	also why we thought the bot wasn't working 
2018-11-14 02:26:55	~ben	oh

2018-11-16 05:42:26	fosslinux	yes please
2018-11-16 05:42:26	~ben	i thought i added sose to the org
2018-11-16 05:42:43	sose	Maybe you did, hold on
2018-11-16 05:42:51	fosslinux	oh yeah you did ben
2018-11-16 05:43:07	fosslinux	can you move your repositories over please sose?
2018-11-16 05:44:21	~ben	owo
2018-11-16 05:44:53	fosslinux	owo?
2018-11-16 05:47:18	sose	What should I call the repo with the themes and stuff?
2018-11-16 05:47:37	sose	Right now its just 'tildelinux'
2018-11-16 05:47:58	~ben	tildelinux is fine i think
2018-11-16 05:48:29	fosslinux	or art maybe?
2018-11-16 05:50:03	sose	K, done
2018-11-16 05:50:12	fosslinux	cool
2018-11-16 05:50:14	fosslinux	thanks
2018-11-16 06:28:21	sose	Oh, also obamenu needs to be packaged for the distro
2018-11-16 06:29:05	fosslinux	oh ok
2018-11-16 06:29:15	fosslinux	everyone, i've decided not to package stuff quite yet
2018-11-16 06:29:24	sose	Alright
2018-11-16 06:29:27	fosslinux	i think it would be better to make sure everything works properly
2018-11-16 06:29:31	fosslinux	and then package it
2018-11-16 06:29:42	sose	True
2018-11-16 06:29:50	fosslinux	sose, what packages are we modifying? do you have a full list?
2018-11-16 06:29:55	fosslinux	(that you have for the gui)
2018-11-16 06:31:23	sose	openbox, xfce4-panel, whiskermenu,  terminator (unless you want to use a different terminal) and lightdm-gtk-greeter
2018-11-16 06:31:43	fosslinux	terminator is fine with me
2018-11-16 06:31:55	fosslinux	info_pid=$(( $! + 2 ))
2018-11-16 06:32:01	fosslinux	this line should be safe
2018-11-16 06:32:12	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-16 06:32:13	fosslinux	no
2018-11-16 06:32:17	fosslinux	it IS NOT sage
2018-11-16 06:32:30	fosslinux	you might kill another running process
2018-11-16 06:33:32	sose	Does $! only apply to processes in the current shell?
2018-11-16 06:34:08	sose	If so, it might be safe-ish, but should still be replaced
2018-11-16 06:34:19	fosslinux	$! contains the process ID of the most recently executed background pipeline
2018-11-16 06:34:29	sose	Right
2018-11-16 06:34:31	fosslinux	from stackoverflow
2018-11-16 06:34:50	sose	The function starts two processes, and I want to kill the last one
2018-11-16 06:34:52	fosslinux	so no, not nessecarily safe
2018-11-16 06:34:55	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-16 06:34:56	fosslinux	i see
2018-11-16 06:35:28	sose	I could return the pid, but that's s bit weird
2018-11-16 06:35:40	fosslinux	hmm
2018-11-16 06:36:20	fosslinux	idk
2018-11-16 06:36:25	fosslinux	let's just leave it for now
2018-11-16 06:36:32	fosslinux	it's not too much of an issue
2018-11-16 06:36:39	sose	Ok
2018-11-16 06:36:59	fosslinux	it looks pretty good
2018-11-16 06:37:06	fosslinux	the script in general

2018-11-16 06:37:19	fosslinux	1. change tabs to spaces (nitpick)
2018-11-16 06:37:32	fosslinux	2. spelling and puncuation in messages
2018-11-16 06:38:05	sose	Oh lol I always screw up spelling
2018-11-16 06:38:10	fosslinux	np
2018-11-16 06:38:15	fosslinux	dont worry about it :P
2018-11-16 06:38:40	fosslinux	just wondering, is there a reason i shouldn't use this with pre-existing ssh confi
2018-11-16 06:38:44	fosslinux	s/$/g
2018-11-16 06:38:45	sedbot	<fosslinux> just wondering, is there a reason i shouldn't use this with pre-existing ssh config
2018-11-16 06:39:42	sose	Its fine now, I tested it
2018-11-16 06:39:45	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-16 06:40:01	sose	As long as your config isnt *super* weird
2018-11-16 06:40:10	sose	Like a host named Host or something
2018-11-16 06:40:34	fosslinux	lol
2018-11-16 06:40:39	fosslinux	why would you do that
2018-11-16 06:41:23	sose	"Research" lol
2018-11-16 06:41:47	sose	Also you don't like sose and want to break his scripts
2018-11-16 06:42:10	sose	btw, im not by a pc, could you delete yad.sh from the repo for me? 
2018-11-16 06:42:26	fosslinux	lol
2018-11-16 06:42:28	fosslinux	sure
2018-11-16 06:42:32	fosslinux	i was wondering what that was
2018-11-16 06:42:38	sose	Its an old leftover from testing that I accidentally pushed
2018-11-16 06:43:36	fosslinux	done

2018-11-17 17:49:33	sose	I saw the commit, does anyone here have a yourtilde account?
2018-11-17 17:52:57	deepend	me.. but I run it so that makes sense :D 
2018-11-17 17:57:13	sose	Do you mind testing out the changes we just pushed to the repo? 
2018-11-17 17:57:16	sose	https://tildegit.org/tildelinux/tildemerge
2018-11-17 17:59:31	deepend	i can 
2018-11-17 18:04:00	deepend	does that script accept private key that requires a passcode.. or do I need to make a private key without passcode
2018-11-17 18:07:58	sose	You would need a private key without a passcode
2018-11-17 18:08:19	sose	I'll put that on the todo list though
2018-11-17 18:08:26	deepend	ok.. in future if I were to use the script I prefer to password my private keys
2018-11-17 18:11:40	deepend	wonder why tilde.town always ends up in my firewalls block list.. wonder who keeps trying to login and fails.. 
2018-11-17 18:34:24	deepend	Login successful! Writing ssh config...
2018-11-17 18:34:26	deepend	Would you like to configure sshfs for this server? (y/n)
2018-11-17 18:34:28	deepend	y
2018-11-17 18:34:30	deepend	What would you like to call the local directory? (~/Remote/...)?
2018-11-17 18:34:32	deepend	Created directory /home/deepend/Remote/.
2018-11-17 18:34:34	deepend	What directory on "team" would you like to link it to? (absolute path)
2018-11-17 18:34:36	deepend	/home/deepend/
2018-11-17 18:34:38	deepend	Linking directory /home/deepend/Remote/ to /home/deepend/ on "team".
2018-11-17 18:34:40	deepend	read: Connection reset by peer
2018-11-17 18:34:42	deepend	am I doing anything wrong? :D
2018-11-17 18:43:13	deepend	sose: ^   ben: ^
2018-11-17 20:11:53	fosslinux	um depend
2018-11-17 20:11:59	fosslinux	deepend
2018-11-17 20:12:02	fosslinux	ill have a look
2018-11-17 20:12:12	fosslinux	it did work for me...
2018-11-17 20:12:51	deepend	not sure what the deal is.. I'll take a look at my logs if there are anything for sshfs
2018-11-17 20:13:03	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-17 20:13:04	fosslinux	damn
2018-11-17 20:13:10	fosslinux	on this machine i can't test rn
2018-11-17 20:13:36	fosslinux	deepend can i dm a key to you and then can you add it to my account so i can test?
2018-11-17 20:13:48	deepend	yep
2018-11-17 20:13:55	fosslinux	thanks
2018-11-17 20:13:55	deepend	or email it
2018-11-17 20:14:07	fosslinux	check dm
2018-11-17 20:26:22	fosslinux	deepend: i can't reporduce that error
2018-11-17 20:26:56	fosslinux	it might be your internet connection?
2018-11-17 20:27:09	fosslinux	are you behind a proxy or firewall
2018-11-17 20:27:33	fosslinux	can you try running `sshfs deepend@yourtilde.com ~/Remote/yourtilde`?
2018-11-17 20:28:12	deepend	i am trying to connect from yourtilde to tilde.team using that script
2018-11-17 20:28:21	deepend	its not from my local machine
2018-11-17 20:28:30	deepend	does sshfs use a different port? 
2018-11-17 20:28:31	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-17 20:28:40	fosslinux	not afaik
2018-11-17 20:28:58	fosslinux	let me try from ~team
2018-11-17 20:29:01	deepend	as long as it is using port 22 it should function.. but dont know 
2018-11-17 20:29:26	deepend	unless it connects via 22 and then switches to a secondary range of ports...
2018-11-17 20:34:52	deepend	well not firewall related.. turned off firewall on yourtilde for a sec to test
2018-11-17 20:35:29	fosslinux	i just tried both yourtilde -> team and team -> yourtilde
2018-11-17 20:35:31	fosslinux	both worked
2018-11-17 20:35:45	deepend	the sshfs ?
2018-11-17 20:36:28	fosslinux	yep
2018-11-17 20:36:44	fosslinux	can you try again? it might be something weird with your config or just a one time error
2018-11-17 20:36:47	deepend	hmm.. not sure why its not working for me.. ssh in general works fine...
2018-11-17 20:37:05	deepend	i've tried like 20 times lol
2018-11-17 20:37:18	fosslinux	lol
2018-11-17 20:37:19	fosslinux	um
2018-11-17 20:37:24	fosslinux	does sshfs by itself work?
2018-11-17 20:38:17	deepend	never used sshfs personally.. installed it just for this script to function :D 
2018-11-17 20:38:43	fosslinux	just run sshfs deepend@yourtilde.com ~/Remote/yourtilde
2018-11-17 20:39:31	deepend	says missing host
2018-11-17 20:40:50	deepend	read: Connection reset by peer    <-- 
2018-11-17 20:41:03	deepend	sshfs deepend@tilde.team:/home/deepend ~/Remote/team    is what i ended up trying
2018-11-17 20:42:41	fosslinux	hmmmmmmm
2018-11-17 20:42:49	fosslinux	idk let me have a look a bit later
2018-11-17 20:42:52	fosslinux	ive gtg for now
2018-11-17 20:43:22	deepend	k
2018-11-17 20:43:26	deepend	thanks for trying :) 
2018-11-17 21:28:36	sose	deepend can you ssh in normally? 
2018-11-17 21:28:41	sose	Without sshfs
2018-11-17 21:29:11	sose	And can you show what it puts in /var/log/auth.log
2018-11-17 21:29:22	sose	When you try to sshfs
2018-11-17 21:35:37	deepend	ssh in to tilde.team no problem.  
2018-11-17 21:36:50	deepend	haven't found any logs that show anything to do with sshfs 
2018-11-17 21:37:18	deepend	maybe ben could look at his logs and see if it shows anythign when I try to connect with sshfs? 
2018-11-17 21:38:16	~ben	try now i'm watching auth.log
2018-11-17 21:58:35	deepend	oh sorry..walked away for a moment ben 
2018-11-17 21:59:20	deepend	tried
2018-11-17 21:59:44	~ben	Nov 17 16:59:16 tilde sshd[28155]: Connection closed by authenticating user deepend 142.44.251.173 port 55802 [preauth]
2018-11-17 22:00:05	fosslinux	hmm
2018-11-17 22:00:08	deepend	there we go.. what port range does that sshfs use.. 
2018-11-17 22:00:11	fosslinux	so it's not an issue w/ the script
2018-11-17 22:00:32	deepend	nm.. i remembered I did test without firewall enabled as well
2018-11-17 22:00:45	sose	sshfs should use 22?
2018-11-17 22:01:53	login	i wonder how sshfs would work without just scping all the files
2018-11-17 22:02:08	login	and then scping back after each edit...
2018-11-17 22:02:35	sose	so just monitor the directory and scp the files when they're changed?
2018-11-17 22:03:00	fosslinux	no sose
2018-11-17 22:03:03	jan6	sshfs is literally files over ssh
2018-11-17 22:03:14	fosslinux	i think sshfs uses fuse
2018-11-17 22:03:24	deepend	fosslinux: it does use fuse
2018-11-17 22:03:27	jan6	^
2018-11-17 22:03:56	sose	I know that, I was just wondering what login was proposing
2018-11-17 22:04:42	login	how does fuse work?
2018-11-17 22:04:54	fosslinux	he/she wants to know how sshfs works sose
2018-11-17 22:05:06	sose	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace
2018-11-17 22:05:06	jan6	basically he was thinking it did "monitor all files (kinda tail -f style), and scp on changes", I think
2018-11-17 22:05:16	sose	ahh no
2018-11-17 22:05:22	sose	it does some kernel level suff
2018-11-17 22:05:27	jan6	magic
2018-11-17 22:05:43	jan6	just magic
2018-11-17 22:07:36	sose	^^^
2018-11-17 22:08:48	jan6	basically kernel and driver stuff == magic, usually, here be unicorn-dragons
2018-11-17 22:08:53	fosslinux	yes
2018-11-17 22:09:01	fosslinux	at some point i want to read this
2018-11-17 22:09:35	jan6	https://www.deviantart.com/mnedel/art/Dragon-and-Unicorn-262011653
2018-11-17 22:09:46	fosslinux	let me just find the book
2018-11-17 22:10:06	fosslinux	something about everything a sysadmin needs to know
2018-11-17 22:10:44	fosslinux	the book is caleld
2018-11-17 22:10:59	fosslinux	"How Linux Works - What Every Superuser Should Know"
2018-11-17 22:11:04	fosslinux	by Brian Ward
2018-11-17 22:11:17	fosslinux	it talks about how kernels work and the linux kernelin particular
2018-11-17 22:11:59	jan6	not every superuser should know the kernel workings
2018-11-17 22:12:11	fosslinux	ik
2018-11-17 22:12:27	jan6	but I guess if I find a free copy I could skim it, maybe ever read properly
2018-11-17 22:14:54	login	If it would help me claim that i can do sysadmin work, then i'll read it
2018-11-17 22:15:01	fosslinux	lol login
2018-11-17 22:15:05	fosslinux	proabbly not
2018-11-17 22:15:21	login	then the book is false advertising...
2018-11-17 22:15:30	login	Well, Superuser != sysadmin though, right?
2018-11-17 22:15:35	jan6	yeah
2018-11-17 22:15:36	fosslinux	right
2018-11-17 22:15:45	jan6	also, "should know" != "has to know"
2018-11-17 22:16:05	fosslinux	"should know" != "has to know" != "needs to know"
2018-11-17 22:18:46	jan6	also includes some basic stuff like dotfiles
2018-11-17 22:18:51	 *	jan6 night out
2018-11-17 22:22:42	fosslinux	goodbye jan6
2018-11-17 23:11:42	brendantcc_lounge	summary of the current progress?
2018-11-17 23:17:28	sose	foss is working on packaging stuff, ive added a gui for my script and the custom desktop is just about finished
2018-11-17 23:17:36	sose	no releases yet
2018-11-17 23:19:02	brendantcc_lounge	so that last screenshot i saw from you...
2018-11-17 23:19:24	brendantcc_lounge	was that the latest...?
2018-11-17 23:19:26	sose	Yeah, ive updated the theme and menus
2018-11-17 23:19:31	brendantcc_lounge	can me seeks?
2018-11-17 23:30:01	sose	https://ttm.sh/'
2018-11-17 23:30:07	sose	woops sorry
2018-11-17 23:30:10	sose	https://ttm.sh/ib.png 
2018-11-17 23:30:15	sose	https://ttm.sh/iP.png 
2018-11-17 23:30:20	sose	https://ttm.sh/iw.png 
2018-11-17 23:30:35	brendantcc_lounge	i likey!
2018-11-17 23:30:43	brendantcc_lounge	what does the installer look like?
2018-11-17 23:31:07	sose	Haven't done that yet, but it would probably look like the normal debian installer
2018-11-17 23:31:15	brendantcc_lounge	damn...
2018-11-17 23:31:20	sose	unless we want to use ubiquity or something
2018-11-17 23:31:30	sose	but thats foss's side of things
2018-11-17 23:31:42	brendantcc_lounge	righto
2018-11-17 23:31:53	brendantcc_lounge	fosslinux: don't choose a boring installer man
2018-11-17 23:33:09	sose	If we use ubiquity we'll need to add it to our package repo
2018-11-17 23:34:19	brendantcc_lounge	okay looks like canonical uses ubiquity - im happy
2018-11-17 23:34:31	sose	oh also the bottom bar will use a monospace font in release, I just forgot to change it
2018-11-17 23:34:46	brendantcc_lounge	righto
2018-11-17 23:35:18	brendantcc_lounge	think you could make the design a little bit more cleaner...?
2018-11-17 23:35:25	brendantcc_lounge	i'm not sure i like it too much...
2018-11-17 23:35:35	sose	Of the bar you mean?
2018-11-17 23:35:49	~ben	that looks hot
2018-11-17 23:35:49	brendantcc_lounge	i think the window borders are a little bit thick...
2018-11-17 23:37:34	sose	window borders would require some css tweaking, but should be doable
2018-11-17 23:38:23	brendantcc_lounge	wait...
2018-11-17 23:38:37	brendantcc_lounge	is it all based off of html? lol
2018-11-17 23:39:37	sose	no, gtk just has some... interesting ideas on integrating web technologies into the desktop
2018-11-17 23:40:19	brendantcc_lounge	lol righto
2018-11-17 23:40:29	sose	tbh css is kinda nice for theme configuration, if only it wasn't the only way to do anything useful
2018-11-17 23:42:22	brendantcc_lounge	rip
2018-11-17 23:47:38	sose	Ok ive got a bit of a dillema here I think
2018-11-17 23:47:52	sose	How should we store the location of the ssh config file?
2018-11-17 23:48:15	sose	Should we even store it, or assume it's going to be in ~/.ssh/config
2018-11-17 23:56:04	@khuxkm|lounge	we can just put the SSH config in ~/.ssh/config
2018-11-17 23:56:11	@khuxkm|lounge	so yeah, just assume
2018-11-17 23:58:24	sose	yeah ok
2018-11-17 23:58:37	sose	I was just thinking someone might want to use the standalone script
2018-11-17 23:59:05	sose	but its not that hard to modify anyways so we can just leave it like that for now
2018-11-18 00:55:35	fosslinux	sose: assume is ok 
2018-11-18 00:55:46	fosslinux	brendantcc_lounge: i wasnt thinking of installer yet
2018-11-18 00:56:37	brendantcc_lounge	i reckon we should do a custom ubiquity installer
2018-11-18 00:57:40	sose	Considering its Debian, that would probably be the best choice for a gui
2018-11-18 01:10:32	brendantcc_lounge	well i ain't installing it if it's the default debian installer...
2018-11-18 01:11:08	brendantcc_lounge	also is there display output settings (sc 1 only, duplicate, extend, sc 2 only)?
2018-11-18 01:11:36	brendantcc_lounge	plus, what's the default loading symbol?
2018-11-18 01:13:17	~ben	what's wrong with the debian installer?
2018-11-18 01:13:41	brendantcc_lounge	the buttons man!
2018-11-18 01:13:49	brendantcc_lounge	they look too much like the old Mac OS buttons!
2018-11-18 01:14:03	~ben	so what?
2018-11-18 01:14:39	deepend	i miss the old mac os.. assuming we are talking pre-10.x
2018-11-18 01:14:53	brendantcc_lounge	nostalgia, yeah, cool, but is tildelinux made to be modern...?
2018-11-18 01:15:44	~ben	no it's meant to be tilde
2018-11-18 01:16:26	brendantcc_lounge	well then wheres the point in a gui??!! it could just be a frickin console!!
2018-11-18 01:17:02	brendantcc_lounge	im sure you'd love that ben
2018-11-18 01:17:29	~ben	i'm not a huge fan of cli browsers
2018-11-18 01:17:34	~ben	but it would be doable
2018-11-18 01:17:36	fosslinux	lol brendantcc_lounge Some people prefer the *usability* of a GUI
2018-11-18 01:17:42	fosslinux	ie cli browsers
2018-11-18 01:17:51	deepend	updated windows today.. and it didnt delete anything.. so I'm sad.. I always wanted it to delete stuff for me.. would be easier then me going through my craP :D 
2018-11-18 01:18:10	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-18 01:18:11	fosslinux	actually tbh the only reason i use gui is for browser
2018-11-18 01:18:15	fosslinux	lol deepend
2018-11-18 01:18:16	~ben	same ^^
2018-11-18 01:18:37	fosslinux	do you guys use wsl on windows
2018-11-18 01:18:44	deepend	I need to go back to linux again.. but the audio issues I was having was pissing me off lmao
2018-11-18 01:18:55	fosslinux	deepend: :<
2018-11-18 01:18:56	brendantcc_lounge	used to, but then byobu decided to screw me over in ssh
2018-11-18 01:19:02	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-18 01:19:05	fosslinux	theres a way to fix that
2018-11-18 01:19:10	fosslinux	i can't remeber how
2018-11-18 01:19:11	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-18 01:19:14	fosslinux	i use plain tmux anyway
2018-11-18 01:19:17	fosslinux	which is fine
2018-11-18 01:19:55	deepend	i'm enjoying byobu.. so far.. lol  still not good at using it tho.. I'm sure it probably does more then waht I'm using it for
2018-11-18 01:20:00	~ben	msys2 works fine for me if i have to use windows
2018-11-18 01:20:23	brendantcc_lounge	let's go hog the lounge tv! yay!
2018-11-18 01:21:01	fosslinux	brendantcc_lounge: are you ok??????
2018-11-18 01:21:17	fosslinux	ben: i prefer wsl or cgwin
2018-11-18 01:21:22	fosslinux	s/cgwin/cygwin
2018-11-18 01:21:23	sedbot	<fosslinux> ben: i prefer wsl or cygwin
2018-11-18 01:21:35	~ben	ok
2018-11-18 01:21:53	deepend	i prefer to not use windows.. but here i am.. :(

2018-11-18 01:24:10	fosslinux	some smartness happens *magic*
2018-11-18 01:25:36	~ben	fosslinux: nginx uses SNI
2018-11-18 01:25:49	~ben	it won't resolve without a Host: header

2018-11-18 01:31:34	~ben	lounge room sounds strange to my ear
2018-11-18 01:31:41	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-18 01:31:44	~ben	i'd say "lounge" 
2018-11-18 01:31:47	~ben	instead of "lounge room"
2018-11-18 01:31:49	brendantcc_lounge	"The Lounge" :P

2018-11-18 01:36:41	fosslinux	well learn something else
2018-11-18 01:36:44	fosslinux	thats bad
2018-11-18 01:36:46	fosslinux	learn python
2018-11-18 01:36:54	~ben	python is a decent place to start
2018-11-18 01:37:02	brendantcc_lounge	i dunno...
2018-11-18 01:37:08	fosslinux	python is very good
2018-11-18 01:37:12	brendantcc_lounge	i kinda like making web-based shit with html...
2018-11-18 01:37:15	fosslinux	its both easy and powerful
2018-11-18 01:37:23	~ben	learn some php then
2018-11-18 01:37:30	~ben	or flask
2018-11-18 01:37:31	fosslinux	html is useless w/pout css / javascript /php
2018-11-18 01:37:34	fosslinux	flask?

2018-11-18 01:38:26	brendantcc_lounge	except for the print command cause lol
2018-11-18 01:38:31	~ben	google is your friend
2018-11-18 01:38:40	~ben	the idea is that you learn how to learn
2018-11-18 01:38:41	fosslinux	i had a good tutorial
2018-11-18 01:39:01	fosslinux	it was on udacity i think?
2018-11-18 01:39:08	fosslinux	it taught you basics -> oop
2018-11-18 01:39:17	fosslinux	after that its really making programs
2018-11-18 01:39:22	fosslinux	you learn by making
2018-11-18 01:39:23	brendantcc_lounge	right
2018-11-18 01:39:28	brendantcc_lounge	just prepped a .py file
2018-11-18 01:39:46	brendantcc_lounge	in vscode
2018-11-18 01:39:57	brendantcc_lounge	and lol it recommended the "Python" extension
2018-11-18 01:39:59	fosslinux	that does
2018-11-18 01:40:00	fosslinux	what
2018-11-18 01:40:22	brendantcc_lounge	are you meaning to tell me vscode doesn't ship with extensions for shit like python? wtf?
2018-11-18 01:40:35	fosslinux	it does
2018-11-18 01:40:38	fosslinux	of course
2018-11-18 01:40:45	fosslinux	what will this .py file do
2018-11-18 01:41:03	brendantcc_lounge	idk..
2018-11-18 01:41:12	fosslinux	make a hello world
2018-11-18 01:41:16	brendantcc_lounge	print "hello! what's your name?"
2018-11-18 01:41:22	fosslinux	no
2018-11-18 01:41:28	fosslinux	if we are using python 3
2018-11-18 01:41:28	brendantcc_lounge	wait...
2018-11-18 01:41:34	brendantcc_lounge	is python capable of tts, ben?
2018-11-18 01:41:36	brendantcc_lounge	>:D
2018-11-18 01:41:38	fosslinux	print("hello! whats your name?")
2018-11-18 01:41:39	fosslinux	um
2018-11-18 01:41:45	fosslinux	yes brendantcc_lounge
2018-11-18 01:41:48	fosslinux	python can do tts
2018-11-18 01:41:52	fosslinux	with a libary
2018-11-18 01:42:28	brendantcc_lounge	how do i get py to do input
2018-11-18 01:42:44	fosslinux	var = input("what you name?")
2018-11-18 01:43:38	fosslinux	and then
2018-11-18 01:43:47	fosslinux	print("hi, " + var)
2018-11-18 01:44:07	~ben	or print(f"hi {var}")
2018-11-18 01:44:11	fosslinux	^
2018-11-18 01:44:16	~ben	or print("hi {}".format(var))
2018-11-18 01:44:21	fosslinux	wow ben
2018-11-18 01:44:26	brendantcc_lounge	ben!
2018-11-18 01:44:29	brendantcc_lounge	keep it simple man
2018-11-18 01:44:37	fosslinux	that last one does work
2018-11-18 01:44:38	~ben	none of those are complex
2018-11-18 01:44:42	fosslinux	except i never use it
2018-11-18 01:44:45	fosslinux	because readablity
2018-11-18 01:44:52	fosslinux	^
2018-11-18 01:44:59	fosslinux	none of those are really complex
2018-11-18 01:45:07	~ben	not sure which version of py introduced format string literals
2018-11-18 01:45:14	~ben	i prefer the "".format()
2018-11-18 01:45:19	fosslinux	really?
2018-11-18 01:45:20	~ben	concatenation is slow
2018-11-18 01:45:21	fosslinux	why?
2018-11-18 01:45:27	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-18 01:45:38	~ben	especially if you're doing a lot of string operations
2018-11-18 01:45:51	~ben	concatenation looks messy too
2018-11-18 01:46:14	fosslinux	thats areguable
2018-11-18 01:46:26	fosslinux	id say that looks more messy ("".format())
2018-11-18 01:46:54	brendantcc_lounge	let's move this to #meta, since there seems to be no conversation.
2018-11-18 01:46:59	fosslinux	yes
2018-11-18 01:47:36	~ben	ok
2018-11-18 01:54:38	brendantcc_lounge	also is linting important?
2018-11-18 01:54:48	fosslinux	#meta
2018-11-18 01:54:49	fosslinux	yes
2018-11-18 01:54:55	fosslinux	but not for small projects
2018-11-18 21:43:05	-->	fosslinux| (fosslinux@tilde-9m1cgd.optusnet.com.au) has joined #tildelinux
2018-11-18 23:23:22	<--	fosslinux| (fosslinux@tilde-9m1cgd.optusnet.com.au) has quit (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
2018-11-19 03:27:27	<--	aliasless (aliasless@127.0.0.1) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.2)
2018-11-19 06:03:15	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-19 06:03:26	fosslinux	so today, i'm going to make custom packages for everything we need
2018-11-19 06:03:59	fosslinux	sose: in tildelinux repository, is there EVERYTHING i need to make forks of packages? if not where do i find it?
2018-11-19 06:28:51	sose	The only thing there really is the openbox configs
2018-11-19 06:29:48	sose	I would assume all you need to do is replace whatever config is in the default Debian package with that one
2018-11-19 06:31:02	fosslinux	yep
2018-11-19 06:31:06	fosslinux	its pretty simple
2018-11-19 06:31:34	sose	Then yeah, the configs are there
2018-11-19 06:32:15	sose	The only packages we should make right now are the custom openbox package and a package for obamenu
2018-11-19 06:32:34	fosslinux	what about tildelinux-art?
2018-11-19 06:32:37	fosslinux	that will be needed too
2018-11-19 06:32:48	sose	Ahh yeah that as well
2018-11-19 06:33:36	sose	We should bundle all of that with xfce panel, obconf, obmenu amd obamenu into a tilde-desktop package or something
2018-11-19 06:33:47	sose	s/amd/and
2018-11-19 06:33:47	sedbot	<sose> We should bundle all of that with xfce panel, obconf, obmenu and obamenu into a tilde-desktop package or something
2018-11-19 06:34:07	fosslinux	so what i'm talking about is forking the `apt-get source` so that i can package that
2018-11-19 06:34:24	fosslinux	so i'll have to fork xfce-panel obconf obmenu obamenu seperatley
2018-11-19 06:34:29	fosslinux	then package them seperatley
2018-11-19 06:34:31	fosslinux	then a metapackage
2018-11-19 06:35:18	sose	For now could you do a 'test' run with just the stock debian versions of everything but openbox?
2018-11-19 06:35:39	sose	And we can fork and mod later
2018-11-19 06:36:12	sose	The same metapackage, but just openbox is forked
2018-11-19 06:37:39	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-19 06:37:39	sose	I have no idea how debian packaging works outside of using them so idk
2018-11-19 06:37:47	sose	Alright, cool
2018-11-19 06:37:50	fosslinux	openbox is going ot be the biggest issue
2018-11-19 06:37:53	fosslinux	if anything
2018-11-19 06:37:58	fosslinux	i'd prfer to test that first
2018-11-19 06:38:05	fosslinux	what have you changed in openbox?
2018-11-19 06:38:13	sose	Just configs
2018-11-19 06:38:18	fosslinux	easy
2018-11-19 06:38:25	sose	cool
2018-11-19 06:38:46	sose	Oh, also feh should be in the metapackage
2018-11-19 06:38:56	sose	Along with the arr
2018-11-19 06:39:01	sose	*art
2018-11-19 06:39:01	fosslinux	feh?
2018-11-19 06:39:25	sose	Image viewer/wallpaper engine
2018-11-19 06:39:51	sose	I use it to set the desktop background
2018-11-19 06:40:02	sose	Oh and also terminator and firefox
2018-11-19 06:40:21	sose	All debian upstream, of course
2018-11-19 06:40:59	fosslinux	debian upstream is cool
2018-11-19 06:41:26	sose	Kk good
2018-11-19 06:42:51	sose	By upstream I mean stock debian testing packages btw
2018-11-19 06:43:23	fosslinux	yep
2018-11-19 06:43:59	sose	I'll keep working on the remote mounting script, I'm having trouble making password protected keys work with the gui
2018-11-19 06:44:42	sose	Ill probably do something hacky like run it in a terminal or something
2018-11-19 06:44:56	sose	Unless deepend knows a way to automate it
2018-11-19 06:45:25	fosslinux	deepend says he can't code for his life lol
2018-11-19 06:48:28	sose	well rip
2018-11-19 06:49:23	sose	I *really* don't wanna use expect here, but it might just be the most elegant solution
2018-11-19 06:49:29	fosslinux	except
2018-11-19 06:49:30	fosslinux	ew
2018-11-19 06:49:35	fosslinux	i don't like except
2018-11-19 06:49:47	fosslinux	thats why i dont know it very well :P
2018-11-19 06:49:54	sose	noone likes expect foss
2018-11-19 06:50:41	fosslinux	sose: "noone likes except foss" I DONT LIKE
2018-11-19 06:50:55	sose	No i mean
2018-11-19 06:51:29	sose	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect
2018-11-19 06:51:33	sose	That
2018-11-19 06:52:08	fosslinux	yes i know that
2018-11-19 06:52:16	fosslinux	i dont like tcl or except
2018-11-19 06:52:46	sose	*expect
2018-11-19 06:52:50	sose	But yeah
2018-11-19 06:53:36	sose	I gotta go, ill try to figure this out tomorrow
2018-11-19 06:53:39	fosslinux	cya
2018-11-19 06:53:49	fosslinux	my ingrained ttping skils
2018-11-19 06:53:52	fosslinux	habits
2018-11-19 13:49:27	jan6	y u no tcl
2018-11-20 06:45:16	fosslinux	sose: i think you heard, but thunix is down, permeantly afaik, so we don't need to add it to our script
2018-11-20 07:00:48	sose	oh, thats too bad
2018-11-20 07:13:59	sose	I'm still trying to workout how to do password auth
2018-11-20 07:15:49	fosslinux	passwd auth? or passwd auth for key?
2018-11-20 07:16:08	sose	Password auth for key
2018-11-20 07:16:13	fosslinux	hmm
2018-11-20 07:16:15	fosslinux	i have no idea
2018-11-20 07:16:26	fosslinux	why is it any different?
2018-11-20 07:16:52	sose	So far I dont see any way to do it from the commandline
2018-11-20 07:17:02	fosslinux	but normallly
2018-11-20 07:17:13	fosslinux	well idk i dont use passwords on my ssh keys atm
2018-11-20 07:17:18	sose	normally you just put it in through the console
2018-11-20 07:17:18	fosslinux	i will start doing so
2018-11-20 07:17:23	fosslinux	so
2018-11-20 07:17:40	fosslinux	why dont you just ssh like sormal and get them to input the password?
2018-11-20 07:18:20	sose	Well I would want to do it from the gui
2018-11-20 07:18:41	sose	which I cant do if the password input is terminal only
2018-11-20 07:19:04	fosslinux	ohhh
2018-11-20 07:19:10	fosslinux	so does the password auth work on terminal?
2018-11-20 07:19:15	sose	yeah
2018-11-20 07:19:18	fosslinux	okok
2018-11-20 07:19:20	fosslinux	good
2018-11-20 07:19:21	fosslinux	so
2018-11-20 07:19:28	fosslinux	hmmmmmmmmmm
2018-11-20 07:19:32	sose	but no way to do it from the gui
2018-11-20 07:19:36	sose	afaik
2018-11-20 07:19:36	fosslinux	yeah
2018-11-20 07:20:21	sose	I could maybe prompt the user for the key type and decrypt it manually
2018-11-20 07:20:39	sose	If I do that, I think im gonna have to do some refactoring
2018-11-20 07:20:48	fosslinux	http://rabexc.org/posts/using-ssh-agent
2018-11-20 07:21:29	sose	hmm
2018-11-20 07:22:30	fosslinux	how about
2018-11-20 07:22:33	fosslinux	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340366/how-to-make-ssh-receive-the-password-from-stdin
2018-11-20 07:24:22	sose	ssh-agent seems to have the same issue, where you have to input the password on the commandline

2018-11-20 07:48:58	sose	Oh wow i am dumb
2018-11-20 07:49:38	sose	So it looks like it will ask with a gui as long as the script isn't run in a terminal
2018-11-20 07:50:01	sose	Well, good to know I guess
2018-11-20 07:50:14	 *	sose bangs head against wall

2018-11-24 15:01:03	jan6	kinda like how the usb drives usually appear in the file managers, click, and it mounts
2018-11-24 17:20:00	@sose	Thats what I was working on kinda

2018-12-07 21:55:35	~ben	huh?
2018-12-07 21:55:51	@fosslinux	why is set -e "bad practice"?
2018-12-07 21:56:01	@fosslinux	But it's considered as a bad practice by some people (bash FAQ and such like people writing this FAQ on irc freenode #bash), better use :
2018-12-07 21:56:08	@fosslinux	trap 'do_something' ERR

2018-12-07 21:56:32	~ben	i don't know if i would consider it bad practice
2018-12-07 21:56:37	@fosslinux	i dont
2018-12-07 21:56:46	@fosslinux	i use it in a lot of scripts
2018-12-07 21:56:54	@fosslinux	tomasino: why is set -e "bad practice"?
2018-12-07 22:24:47	tomasino	it will exit the script immediately on an error rather than trap the error and handle cleanup manually
2018-12-07 22:25:32	tomasino	https://tildegit.org/cosmic/cosmic/src/branch/master/bin/cosmic-log#L23-L26  for instance
2018-12-07 22:32:20	tomasino	"bad practice" is a strong label
2018-12-07 22:32:54	tomasino	if you're scripting something that causes changes in the environment or system then it's best to trap exits and clean up. If you're just patching together a string of simple commands, -e is fine
2018-12-07 22:59:24	jan6	so basically trapping allows to delete any temporary files, or variables, or close related programs (like if opening web interface fails, kill server too), and other stuff
2018-12-07 23:22:14	@fosslinux	okay
2018-12-07 23:22:16	@fosslinux	i see
2018-12-08 00:36:46	tomasino	so... um... what's this channel about exactly?
2018-12-08 00:37:02	tomasino	a custom distro?
2018-12-08 02:06:54	login	Yes, exactly!
2018-12-08 02:07:02	login	One that has sshfs
2018-12-08 02:07:05	login	and tilde branding
2018-12-08 02:07:30	login	My wish is for it to be installable as a liveusb with sshfs used for storing data & programs
2018-12-08 02:07:38	login	So your computer is literally in three pieces:
2018-12-08 02:07:41	login	piece 1: hardware
2018-12-08 02:07:45	login	piece 2: os (on flash drive)
2018-12-08 02:07:48	login	piece 3: data & programs
2018-12-08 02:08:16	login	piece 2 probably has a web browser (and associated on-flash-drive storage) as well...
2018-12-08 02:08:34	login	I wouldn't want to put a whole web browser in piece 3

2018-12-09 01:36:55	@fosslinux	for sure
2018-12-09 01:37:29	@fosslinux	ohh
2018-12-09 01:37:39	@fosslinux	but tildemerge links to ~/Remote
2018-12-09 01:41:08	@sose	Yea
2018-12-09 01:41:20	@sose	Remote can just be another folder
2018-12-09 01:41:29	@sose	And you can decide which tilde you want
2018-12-09 01:41:37	@sose	From it
2018-12-09 01:42:22	@sose	Like, ~/ will just be a link to /Remote/town/home or whatever
2018-12-09 01:42:33	@sose	And bin can be the same
2018-12-09 02:28:12	@fosslinux	nice
2018-12-09 02:28:29	@fosslinux	i might start working on a plan for that
2018-12-09 02:28:38	@fosslinux	that could be set up with tildemerge
2018-12-09 02:28:50	@fosslinux	and .ssh would have to link somewhere else too
2018-12-09 09:28:20	jan6	eh
2018-12-09 09:28:41	jan6	not exactly sure about that
2018-12-09 09:29:25	jan6	I think having a graphical OS's home dir on a tilde isn't a good idea
2018-12-09 09:29:44	jan6	but linking ~/bin and ~/.ssh and such is fine
2018-12-09 09:30:44	jan6	and you can just set HOME=whatever before running a program and it'll see whatever as your ~ anyway
2018-12-09 17:13:28	@sose	Maybe just link the files in the remote dir into ~/
2018-12-09 17:46:22	jan6	possibly
2018-12-09 19:55:48	@fosslinux	jan6: why? if you exclude dotfiles then you should be fine
2018-12-09 19:58:26	jan6	sure, but that includes .ssh and .local and such
2018-12-09 19:58:35	jan6	which you're exluding
2018-12-09 19:58:59	@fosslinux	.... so why not have HOME on a tilde
2018-12-09 20:05:13	jan6	because graphical programs' files
2018-12-09 20:05:45	jan6	I guess it's not too bad
2018-12-09 20:05:49	jan6	but eh
2018-12-09 22:59:12	@sose	I think we should have a sync type system instead of pure sshfs
2018-12-09 22:59:23	@sose	since that would make things feel kinda laggy
2018-12-10 06:36:08	@fosslinux	hmm yeah

2018-12-15 22:29:29	@fosslinux	okey dokie
2018-12-15 22:29:30	@fosslinux	thanks
2018-12-15 22:29:38	@fosslinux	i've been working on a sign up to tildes script
2018-12-15 22:30:47	@fosslinux	sose: what does connecting with tildes mean
2018-12-15 22:31:21	@fosslinux	and wat does far progress mean
2018-12-15 22:31:40	@fosslinux	ill get to work packaing tildemerge
2018-12-15 22:33:07	@sose	connecting with tildes is just the rsync stuff
2018-12-15 22:33:14	@sose	but also integrating it into the os
2018-12-15 22:33:21	@fosslinux	oh ok
2018-12-15 22:33:26	@sose	far progrss means almos done basically
2018-12-15 22:33:38	@fosslinux	what would you like me to put as the maintainer
2018-12-15 22:33:40	@sose	s/almos/almost
2018-12-15 22:33:40	sedbot	<sose> far progrss means almost done basically
2018-12-15 22:33:48	@fosslinux	for tildemerge
2018-12-15 22:33:51	@sose	sure
2018-12-15 22:33:57	@fosslinux	??
2018-12-15 22:34:05	@sose	oh sorry
2018-12-15 22:34:06	@fosslinux	what should i put in the maintainer field?
2018-12-15 22:34:11	@sose	I could be maintainer
2018-12-15 22:34:14	@fosslinux	sure
2018-12-15 22:34:23	@fosslinux	what for name, what for email
2018-12-15 22:34:34	@sose	sose, oneseveneight@airmail.cc
2018-12-15 22:34:46	@fosslinux	kk tanks

2018-12-15 22:34:50	sedbot	<fosslinux> kk thanks
2018-12-15 22:35:22	@sose	should probably get another email tbqh, but that one's likend with all my stuff lol
2018-12-15 22:36:11	@sose	s/likend/linked
2018-12-15 22:36:11	sedbot	<sose> should probably get another email tbqh, but that one's linked with all my stuff lol
2018-12-15 22:36:33	@sose	we're probably gonna need to rewrite tildemerge to work with whatever rsync solution we come up with
2018-12-15 22:37:01	@sose	and we're gonna need a way to keep track of tildes and their files
2018-12-15 22:37:46	@sose	maybe sqlite, but idk
2018-12-15 22:39:59	@sose	I was thinking using inotify to monitor file creation and deletion, and then rsync when that happens
2018-12-15 22:40:57	@sose	but then we would need a way for the remote to inform about file changes too
2018-12-15 22:49:21	@sose	ive never used rsync so idk if thats already builtin or whatever, but i'll play around with it and probaly get some scripts up
2018-12-15 23:14:20	@sose	s/probaly/probably
2018-12-15 23:14:21	sedbot	<sose> ive never used rsync so idk if thats already builtin or whatever, but i'll play around with it and probably get some scripts up
2018-12-15 23:37:15	~ben	rsync is basically scp but better
2018-12-16 01:31:15	@fosslinux	sose: should we get a tildelinux email? tildelinux@tildeverse.org? so we can put the maintainer as TildeLinux Development Team <tildelinux@tildeverse.org>
2018-12-16 01:44:10	@fosslinux	sose: does tildemerge use gtk2 or gtk3
2018-12-16 02:01:51	~ben	i can make a mailing list for it too
2018-12-16 02:01:58	~ben	linux@lists.tildeverse.org?
2018-12-16 02:02:14	~ben	i can also set up tildelinux@tildeverse.org to forward to your addresses if you like
2018-12-16 02:02:28	~ben	let me know how you want me to set it up
2018-12-16 02:02:53	@fosslinux	i'd like that but i'd prefer to wait for sose's opinion
2018-12-16 02:03:52	~ben	well i can make the mailing list now
2018-12-16 02:04:03	@fosslinux	ok sure thanks :)
2018-12-16 02:04:28	~ben	https://lists.tildeverse.org/postorius/lists/linux.lists.tildeverse.org/
2018-12-16 02:10:31	@sose	yeah thats cool
2018-12-16 02:11:26	@fosslinux	tildelinux@tildeverse.org?
2018-12-16 02:11:43	~ben	what emails do you want me to forward it to
2018-12-16 02:11:50	~ben	fosslinux@ttm.sh?
2018-12-16 02:11:55	~ben	sose@ttm.sh?
2018-12-16 02:12:42	@fosslinux	yep
2018-12-16 02:12:50	@fosslinux	for me at least
2018-12-16 02:13:08	@fosslinux	i think sose might want oneseveneight@airmail.cc but just check with them
2018-12-16 02:13:36	@sose	i'd prefer airmail
2018-12-16 02:13:41	~ben	sose: you could just drop your preferred mail in ~/.forward on ~team 
2018-12-16 02:13:49	@sose	alright
2018-12-16 02:14:40	~ben	i added you both as owners on the list
2018-12-16 02:14:48	@fosslinux	wat does that do
2018-12-16 02:14:57	~ben	you can change settings for the list
2018-12-16 02:20:52	@sose	oh cool
2018-12-16 02:20:54	@sose	also
2018-12-16 02:21:00	@sose	~ben | rsync is basically scp but better
2018-12-16 02:21:17	~ben	lol yes and?
2018-12-16 02:21:18	@sose	so will it not sync files both directions automatically?
2018-12-16 02:21:29	~ben	there's probably a flag for it
2018-12-16 02:21:33	~ben	i haven't used it that way
2018-12-16 02:23:19	@sose	we could probably just do an inotify hook on the remote end to sync the files back now that I think of it
2018-12-16 02:23:34	@sose	how is rsync better than scp btw?
2018-12-16 02:24:26	~ben	it handles symlinks, permissions, owners, modify dates and the like
2018-12-16 02:24:29	~ben	plus it's way faster
2018-12-16 02:24:34	~ben	compression
2018-12-16 02:24:39	~ben	man rsync
2018-12-16 02:24:45	@sose	looking at it rn
2018-12-16 02:24:59	~ben	in a lot of cases you can just drop it in for scp
2018-12-16 02:25:27	~ben	-avz is archive verbose zip(compress) and that handle symlinks and permissions
2018-12-16 02:26:05	@sose	does it matter whether you use ssh or the daemon? 
2018-12-16 02:26:41	~ben	i've never had a need to use the daemon but this might be a use-case for it
2018-12-16 02:27:26	@sose	rsync is preinstalled on town but idk about others
2018-12-16 02:27:35	@sose	we can just use ssh for now I guess
2018-12-16 02:28:25	~ben	ssh doesn't replace rsync
2018-12-16 02:28:33	~ben	rsync is installed on ~team
2018-12-16 02:28:39	~ben	yourtilde as well afaik
2018-12-16 02:28:55	@sose	I mean the ssh transport
2018-12-16 02:29:09	@sose	still using rsync though
2018-12-16 02:29:21	@sose	instead of the daemon
2018-12-16 02:30:26	~ben	oh
2018-12-16 02:30:29	~ben	ok yeah that's fine
2018-12-16 02:39:12	@sose	btw mailman doesnt seem to be taking my token
2018-12-16 02:39:36	~ben	subscription token?
2018-12-16 02:39:58	~ben	you're on the subscriber list
2018-12-16 02:40:32	~ben	if you make an account on the web ui with your airmail address you'll have access to the list settings
2018-12-16 02:41:01	@sose	hmm ok
2018-12-16 02:41:05	@sose	im getting this https://hastebin.com/miyeveduko.coffeescript
2018-12-16 02:42:24	~ben	strange
2018-12-16 04:45:21	@sose	idk i'll just frorward though right?
2018-12-16 04:45:28	@sose	from ~team?
2018-12-16 04:51:41	@sose	*it'll
2018-12-16 05:05:32	~ben	yups
2018-12-16 05:49:36	@fosslinux	7/go 36
2018-12-16 05:49:41	@fosslinux	woooops
2018-12-16 05:53:03	~ben	oh wow
2018-12-16 05:53:16	~ben	36 for me is #pleroma on freenode lol
2018-12-16 05:55:34	@fosslinux	lol
2018-12-16 05:58:02	~ben	this is 101 oof
2018-12-16 05:58:12	~ben	i should probably trim my channels
2018-12-16 06:48:31	login	do you switch using /buffer?
2018-12-16 06:51:15	~ben	no
2018-12-16 06:51:24	~ben	that's way too many chars to type
2018-12-16 06:51:27	~ben	alt-a
2018-12-16 07:00:49	login	how does alt-a work?
2018-12-16 07:03:04	~ben	it goes to the oldes unread buffer in your hotlist
2018-12-16 07:03:48	~ben	the hotlist is the thing in the status line that looks like [H: num(num), num(num), num]
