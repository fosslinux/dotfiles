2018-11-13 23:38:26	@khuxkm|lounge	you can use it to write networking programs without having to deal with socket stuff
2018-11-13 23:38:45	@khuxkm|lounge	you get input on stdin and output to stdout
2018-11-13 23:38:54	@khuxkm|lounge	and ncat takes care of the socket requirements

2018-11-13 23:52:37	~deepend	there is always risks with having a bunch of users being allowed to log into your system that you are responsible for .. 
2018-11-13 23:53:06	~deepend	is somewhat partly why I am somewhat strict with my firewall for incoming and outgoing..
2018-11-13 23:53:31	~deepend	but even then you cant be 100% sure nothing will happen
2018-11-13 23:55:06	~deepend	ben: can you believe it literally took 10 minutes to transfer my .ca domain from enom to namesilo?  
2018-11-13 23:55:15	~ben	deepend: lol yeah i can believe that
2018-11-13 23:55:26	~ben	yeah ther are always risks if anyone else logs in
2018-11-13 23:55:38	~ben	namesilo is super solid

2018-11-13 23:57:11	~deepend	dont know if it was namesilo or .ca itself that was being fast lastnight
2018-11-13 23:57:38	~ben	could be either or both

2018-11-14 03:31:27	+tomasino	css too
2018-11-14 03:31:45	brendantcc_lounge	why did you put a username/password on the page?
2018-11-14 03:32:09	+tomasino	because it's not public yet. this is my staging site for client review and medical & legal approval processes
2018-11-14 03:32:23	+tomasino	it's all approved now but they're timing everything to go out with a social media push
2018-11-14 03:32:26	+tomasino	so ... thursday
2018-11-14 03:32:35	brendantcc_lounge	ah right
2018-11-14 03:32:48	+tomasino	this uses css
2018-11-14 03:32:48	brendantcc_lounge	i'm trying to go through the source to find out how you did it though...
2018-11-14 03:32:52	+tomasino	er, css-grid
2018-11-14 03:32:52	brendantcc_lounge	just ftr
2018-11-14 03:33:03	brendantcc_lounge	you're kidding, right?
2018-11-14 03:33:06	brendantcc_lounge	it's in the CSS?!
2018-11-14 03:33:10	+tomasino	not the password
2018-11-14 03:33:14	+tomasino	that's in the .htaccess
2018-11-14 03:33:17	+tomasino	you won't be able to see it
2018-11-14 03:33:20	+tomasino	it's server-side
2018-11-14 03:33:25	brendantcc_lounge	frick...
2018-11-14 03:33:31	+tomasino	it's very simple to do
2018-11-14 03:33:44	+tomasino	actually.... i'm running nginx, so it's not even that
2018-11-14 03:33:47	+tomasino	hah
2018-11-14 03:33:51	+tomasino	let me grab the code for you 
2018-11-14 03:33:58	brendantcc_lounge	okay thanks
2018-11-14 03:34:42	+tomasino	huh, something's up with my paste
2018-11-14 03:35:06	brendantcc_lounge	just paste it into an email: mailto:brendantcc@tilde.team
2018-11-14 03:35:25	+tomasino	do you know anything about nginx yet?
2018-11-14 03:35:44	brendantcc_lounge	nope
2018-11-14 03:35:47	+tomasino	i just added a location directive for /paving and said satisfy all and enabled basic-auth
2018-11-14 03:35:55	+tomasino	it's like 4 lines of code in the config
2018-11-14 03:35:55	brendantcc_lounge	righto
2018-11-14 03:35:59	+tomasino	apache is really similar
2018-11-14 03:36:05	+tomasino	basic-auth is the thing to google for examples
2018-11-14 03:36:31	+tomasino	i wonder what's up with my clipboard, though
2018-11-14 03:36:41	brendantcc_lounge	latest ver of windows 10?
2018-11-14 03:36:45	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-14 03:36:48	+tomasino	linux mint with i3
2018-11-14 03:36:53	brendantcc_lounge	lol okay
2018-11-14 03:37:25	brendantcc_lounge	btw i want to start off having the username/password block on the file, not with nginx or anything
2018-11-14 03:37:43	brendantcc_lounge	then i'll eventually use that as an example to protect my newtabportal
2018-11-14 03:38:16	brendantcc_lounge	i've got a html file ready to go
2018-11-14 03:38:45	+tomasino	where are you hosting your files?
2018-11-14 03:39:00	brendantcc_lounge	right now, directly on my laptop, then on ~team
2018-11-14 03:39:34	+tomasino	password protecting files and folders is done at the webserver level, so on team you'd have to see what ben is running and if he allows local control of that sort of thing
2018-11-14 03:39:37	brendantcc_lounge	i have to have it all local, otherwise i can't edit it with my new code editor ;-;
2018-11-14 03:39:52	+tomasino	if he's running apache, you can probably drop an .htaccess file in the directory
2018-11-14 03:39:56	brendantcc_lounge	also, ben uses nginx
2018-11-14 03:40:05	+tomasino	i don't know if nginx has a similar thing... hmmm
2018-11-14 03:40:09	+tomasino	ben?
2018-11-14 03:40:20	brendantcc_lounge	look...
2018-11-14 03:40:37	brendantcc_lounge	for now, how about we focus on having it read from... a text file..

2018-11-14 03:41:07	~ben	nginx does not have .htaccess
2018-11-14 03:42:05	+tomasino	reading up on it that seems to be the biggest complaint about nginx
2018-11-14 03:42:15	+tomasino	not friendly for local control in shared hosting systems
2018-11-14 03:43:18	+tomasino	brendantcc_lounge: if you want to password protect your page you'll need to use a server-side language then, like php or python
2018-11-14 03:43:29	+tomasino	it's a little more involved than basic_auth
2018-11-14 03:44:55	brendantcc_lounge	do you know how to password-protect by reading from a txt file?
2018-11-14 03:46:03	+tomasino	not sure exactly what you're trying to do, but you could use php to look for a $_REQUEST parameter with a password of some sort. if set, display the page, if not, display an error.
2018-11-14 03:46:11	+tomasino	i'll mock something up on team
2018-11-14 03:46:36	brendantcc_lounge	this is how i have the txt file set: https://ttm.sh/eJ.png

2018-11-14 04:38:40	brendantcc_lounge	btw the password is "tilde"

2018-11-14 04:40:08	brendantcc_lounge	thanks man
2018-11-14 04:40:36	brendantcc_lounge	all i need is a username field in the alert, with the username "tildeuser" for now
2018-11-14 04:41:26	deepend	not really any point in having a password page if the password required is in plain text in the source...
2018-11-14 04:41:54	brendantcc_lounge	don't argue about it :p
2018-11-14 04:42:04	brendantcc_lounge	idk how to get php into the mix
2018-11-14 04:43:12	deepend	if anything find out if tilde.team allows use of .htaccess file and it'll still be a half ass approach but would be better then using plan text password in html file....
2018-11-14 04:43:32	brendantcc_lounge	yeah since tilde.team uses nginx, apparently it doesnt
2018-11-14 04:44:16	deepend	nginx doesn't support htaccess.. or they just didnt' configure for it?

2018-11-14 08:33:47	severak	tilde.chat up again
2018-11-14 08:35:15	fosslinux	yep
2018-11-14 08:35:36	erxeto	there's a slight problem with dns still, at least from here. But I'll tell ben when he's online
2018-11-14 08:35:42	fosslinux	oh what is it?
2018-11-14 08:35:56	fosslinux	severak: see ben's blog for what happened
2018-11-14 08:36:04	erxeto	tilde.chat resolves to 2 ips. And one of then has no port listening (at least for irc)
2018-11-14 08:36:18	fosslinux	owo
2018-11-14 08:36:24	fosslinux	not for me it dosent
2018-11-14 08:36:26	erxeto	I guess it could be some dns records propagating 
2018-11-14 08:36:38	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-14 08:36:41	fosslinux	i know why
2018-11-14 08:36:53	fosslinux	ben and deepend were setting up some redundancy
2018-11-14 08:37:03	fosslinux	so afaik deepend now has his own tilde.chat instance
2018-11-14 08:37:10	fosslinux	team.tilde.chat is the normal one i think
2018-11-14 08:37:20	erxeto	ok, then the service is listening on one ip and not the other 
2018-11-14 08:37:20	fosslinux	and that points to tilde.chat
2018-11-14 08:37:42	erxeto	yeah, that's the one that works
2018-11-14 08:37:48	fosslinux	ah, just did dns lookup
2018-11-14 08:37:53	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-14 08:38:08	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-14 08:38:15	fosslinux	so theres two A records
2018-11-14 08:38:17	erxeto	so team.tilde.caht points to the ip that is actually listening, but tilde.chat has 2 A records, one of them has no irc service listening
2018-11-14 08:38:33	fosslinux	the second's domain is bhh.sh
2018-11-14 08:38:38	fosslinux	wth is that?
2018-11-14 08:38:38	erxeto	weechat tries one after the other, so no big deal
2018-11-14 08:39:09	erxeto	that's ben's personal domain I think
2018-11-14 08:39:20	erxeto	or one of them

2018-11-14 15:37:20	+jan6	sure
2018-11-14 15:37:26	+jan6	but the problem is the content
2018-11-14 15:37:53	mushmouth	it wouldn't have to be weekly jan6
2018-11-14 15:37:57	mushmouth	or nightly
2018-11-14 15:38:04	+jan6	town has a theoretical newsletter AND a theoretical zine, nether actually are released, cause lack of content
2018-11-14 15:38:09	~ben	monthly
2018-11-14 15:38:27	+jan6	if you can catch enough cool stuff, do it
2018-11-14 15:38:31	cdmnky	it doesn't have to be just news, there could be prose and q&as and other stuff

2018-11-14 15:45:35	TildeBot	jan6: Yes i am certainly not a computer program, and the purposeful incompetence of homeland security, all hail master jan6 commands to get rid of the village idiot.
2018-11-14 15:45:44	tildebeast	god of what though...? i mean, we have a household deity that some might call "large flint nodule found on a beach that looks a bit like a statue", which description i deny loudly.

2018-11-14 15:46:17	+jan6	god of SOMEthing
2018-11-14 15:46:28	+jan6	also you can refer to me as "someone" from now on
2018-11-14 15:47:00	tildebeast	as i can do that for everyone else too, i look forward to the delicious ambiguity

2018-11-14 15:48:49	+jan6	indeed
2018-11-14 15:49:17	+jan6	"who caused all this mess?" "they said they were someone"
2018-11-14 15:49:58	+jan6	"someone is the ing of chaos"

2018-11-14 15:50:29	+aewens	Did someone say chaos?

2018-11-14 15:51:45	tildebeast	i counter that by asserting that i, too, am someone
2018-11-14 15:51:52	tildebeast	so there and ya boo sucks
2018-11-14 15:52:10	+jan6	someone is grumpy right now

2018-11-14 15:53:46	+jan6	well, someone forgot to take their dedepressants (aka pressants) ;P

2018-11-14 15:55:03	+jan6	hay darren you
2018-11-14 15:55:07	tildebeast	in black tea, yes. it's a cultural thing
2018-11-14 15:55:17	+jan6	also, is it afro-american tea?
2018-11-14 15:55:18	tildebeast	in green tea/white tea etc, never
2018-11-14 15:55:31	tildebeast	no, black tea as in how it's fermented or something
2018-11-14 15:55:34	+jan6	lol
2018-11-14 15:56:08	+jan6	you can't say black tea anymore, it's tea-ist
2018-11-14 15:56:15	+aewens	I tend to go with unsweetened Red Diamond tea over ice with a splash of lemon juice.
2018-11-14 15:56:47	 *	jan6 throws an ice cube in aewens's tea to make it splash out, for sounding too aristocratic
2018-11-14 15:56:50	tildebeast	+1 to that. iced lemon tea is just the ticket in the summer
2018-11-14 15:56:55	+aewens	But right now I just have a mug of filtered water, or as jan6 calls it, Freedom water.

2018-11-14 16:51:07	mushmouth	i wish you could get japanese citizenship without marriage
2018-11-14 16:52:23	tildebeast	no naturalisation period?
2018-11-14 16:52:51	mushmouth	excuse me?
2018-11-14 16:52:57	mushmouth	i don't understand the word
2018-11-14 16:53:40	tildebeast	i mean that in many countries if you live there legally for, say 5 or 6 years, then you're entitled to apply for nationality.
2018-11-14 16:53:57	mushmouth	nope
2018-11-14 16:54:00	tildebeast	wow
2018-11-14 16:54:08	mushmouth	you need to marry a japanese women and be there for 6months or so
2018-11-14 16:54:11	tildebeast	that's unusual
2018-11-14 16:54:32	mushmouth	well it a culture thing
2018-11-14 16:54:38	mushmouth	and since im gay i can't really marry
2018-11-14 16:55:06	tildebeast	that's a really tough break. are you living there at the moment?
2018-11-14 16:55:13	mushmouth	no
2018-11-14 16:55:15	mushmouth	i want to
2018-11-14 16:55:21	mushmouth	but due to the citizenship req
2018-11-14 16:55:23	mushmouth	no
2018-11-14 16:55:53	tildebeast	i just looked at 'tokyoimmigration.jp' and they do have a 5-yr naturalisation period
2018-11-14 16:56:09	tildebeast	but you have to be living there legally for that whole time

2018-11-14 16:57:08	tildebeast	it's a bit harsh
2018-11-14 16:57:14	mushmouth	and im fine being in canada
2018-11-14 16:57:57	tildebeast	canada seems like an island of sanity at the moment, at least compared to Certain Other English-Speaking Nations

2018-11-14 17:33:11	mushmouth	cdmnky: should of just gotten a thinkpad tbh
2018-11-14 17:33:19	+jan6	I'm quite fine with my x220 (not good for gaming but fine for all else)
2018-11-14 17:33:37	+jan6	so anything better or on par with it will do fine
2018-11-14 17:33:48	+jan6	also you can buy a huge battery pack fo rit

2018-11-14 17:34:26	cdmnky	ugh, it didn't even come with a warranty either. why is it that every device I buy always breaks somehow? It's like manufacturers don't care about sturdiness!
2018-11-14 17:34:41	+jan6	heh

2018-11-14 17:35:43	+jan6	buy a new drive just in case anyway?
2018-11-14 17:35:48	~ben	and it looks like it got picked up for the site too
2018-11-14 17:35:51	mushmouth	i swear by thinkpads
2018-11-14 17:35:53	+jan6	you're gonna need a new drive EVENTUALLY
2018-11-14 17:35:54	~ben	since there are multiple A records
2018-11-14 17:36:24	cdmnky	jan6: I bought it new in June lol, and it's the same model HDD that's in my desktop

2018-11-14 17:37:01	cdmnky	the 7200RPM version I think
2018-11-14 17:37:02	+jan6	hmh, kay
2018-11-14 17:37:27	+jan6	can always try to trim and clean stuff from it
2018-11-14 17:37:59	+jan6	and occassionally zero everything out and repartition if it's still way too slow
2018-11-14 17:38:14	cdmnky	I was using it for everything until my internet came back on. I'm thinking about doing a fresh install with only stuff I need for productivity
2018-11-14 17:38:50	cdmnky	thanks to ben and stow, setting up my config is easy-peasy
2018-11-14 17:39:04	~ben	thanks to tomasino for the makefile example ;)
2018-11-14 17:39:23	cdmnky	yeah, make is awesome too
2018-11-14 17:39:52	+tomasino	woohoo
2018-11-14 17:40:06	cdmnky	although, I should add something to backup the non-symlinked files that exist already to prevent that error
2018-11-14 17:40:16	~ben	make + stow is dope
2018-11-14 17:40:58	cdmnky	although I can't backup my mutt configs sadly, since I can't figure out how to not use plaintext passwords for those
2018-11-14 17:41:18	cdmnky	prooobably not a good idea lol
2018-11-14 17:45:26	+jan6	why not ;P
2018-11-14 17:47:02	+jan6	you cooould use another program to insert the password there
2018-11-14 17:47:40	cdmnky	if only mutt had a wpa_passphrase like thing
2018-11-14 17:48:11	cdmnky	wpa_passphrase is awesome, ever since I started using it, I've stopped using NetworkManager applet
2018-11-14 17:48:21	+jan6	but I think it's fine if you need to input a single password or stuff like that
2018-11-14 17:50:28	+jan6	password=get password here;sed "s/password=xxxx/password=$password"
2018-11-14 17:50:35	+jan6	password=get password here;sed "s/password=xxxx/password=$password" .muttrc
2018-11-14 17:50:39	+jan6	or something like that

2018-11-14 18:21:03	~ben	it was off
2018-11-14 18:21:17	tunas	What was off?
2018-11-14 18:21:33	cdmnky	aewens: it keeps going into different levels beyond it (I can't remember what the rest are called, but they have the greek prefixes)
2018-11-14 18:21:54	cdmnky	3^^5 < larger than 64 bits
2018-11-14 18:22:18	+aewens	I think for Graham's number he calls them arrow functions when you go to the next level (^^^)

2018-11-14 18:24:18	~ben	tower of powers
2018-11-14 18:24:34	+aewens	What's truly terrifying is the implications of networking in an IPv32 world.

2018-11-14 18:29:37	+aewens	Right, you listen to HI too?
2018-11-14 18:29:54	~ben	of course ;)
2018-11-14 18:31:29	+aewens	There never seems to be enough HI or Cortex in my life. I need more CGP Grey but I know he's never giving it to us.
2018-11-14 18:31:39	+aewens	Especially now that he maybe has a kid.
2018-11-14 18:32:11	~ben	woah what
2018-11-14 18:32:23	~ben	i haven't listened to cortex
2018-11-14 18:33:24	+aewens	Cortex is the mistress podcast Brady refers to, it's a podcast Grey is doing with Myke Hurley, CEO of Relay FM
2018-11-14 18:34:32	~ben	yeah i know about it, just haven't listened :P
2018-11-14 18:34:56	+aewens	Like how HI is supposed to be about two YouTubers talking but has slowly became a meta meme show about itself, Cortex is two CEOs talking about how they run their business that has slowly become the transformation of Myke Hurley becoming hipster CGP Grey.
2018-11-14 18:35:14	~ben	grey is a ceo?  of?
2018-11-14 18:36:22	+aewens	Of Grey Industries of course.
2018-11-14 18:36:33	~ben	that's a real thing?
2018-11-14 18:36:34	tunas	He owns an island, doesn't he?
2018-11-14 18:36:35	~ben	lol
2018-11-14 18:36:54	+aewens	Just listen to the podcast's first episode, it explains it with much more tact than I will.

2018-11-14 18:38:25	arne	:(
2018-11-14 18:38:32	+aewens	Hey arne, how's things?
2018-11-14 18:39:39	~ben	henlo lizer
2018-11-14 18:43:42	+jan6	lazard
2018-11-14 18:43:54	+aewens	hazard
2018-11-14 18:47:31	cdmnky	I'm thinking about asking for a ram upgrade, although 8GB might be enough
2018-11-14 18:48:04	cdmnky	although if I'm going to start compiling a lot of stuff, I might want more (especially since Ryzen benefits from more and faster memory)
2018-11-14 18:48:16	cdmnky	*for christmas
2018-11-14 18:48:45	cdmnky	jeez, these ram prices are insane
2018-11-14 18:49:28	+jan6	feel free to
2018-11-14 18:49:38	+jan6	get 256 gigs of ram, lol
2018-11-14 18:49:54	cdmnky	yeah, but the 2x8 version of the 8 gig stick that I got for $40 last year is $160 now
2018-11-14 18:50:38	cdmnky	I can't justify asking for ram if it's this overpriced on average
2018-11-14 18:51:21	cdmnky	even the cheap green board 2x8 2400MHz is $109
2018-11-14 18:52:09	~ben	ram is crazy rn
2018-11-14 18:52:19	+aewens	It's mind blowing how much RAM the HPC systems have these day. Just the other day I was working on one with 1.5TB of RAM.
2018-11-14 18:52:31	cdmnky	tbh I just want cash, but asking for like $200 seems petty
2018-11-14 18:52:37	+jan6	srsly?!
2018-11-14 18:53:07	+jan6	terabyte ram, you could have like, 2 full systems fully in ram AND have some left for proccessing
2018-11-14 18:54:11	cdmnky	right now the only things I can think of for christmas is a 2019 moleskine and a pilot vanishing point
2018-11-14 18:54:15	+aewens	It also has 4x Xeon processors with about 12-cores each.
2018-11-14 18:54:34	cdmnky	jeez, it'd be cheaper to upgrade my CPU then to get more ram
2018-11-14 18:55:05	cdmnky	Currently running an R3 1200 on a B350 mobo
2018-11-14 18:55:07	+aewens	The market was artifically inflated, sucks for everyone and not even a class action lawsuit fixed it.
2018-11-14 18:55:38	cdmnky	or even a cheap AMD card so I don't have to deal with nvidia drivers
2018-11-14 18:55:59	cdmnky	but the inner "use it till it breaks" in me would be screaming if I do that
2018-11-14 18:56:58	cdmnky	also I don't want to unmount the cooler again. last time it took the cpu with it lol. Took me a half hour with a hair dryer and alcohol to loosen up the thermal paste
2018-11-14 18:58:35	cdmnky	my desktop cpu is running great, but now that ryzen 2xxx is fully supported by the kernel, it might be a good idea to upgrade
2018-11-14 18:59:33	cdmnky	I should get case fans! the ones I have now have way too short cables and are loud af
2018-11-14 19:00:28	+aewens	I'm personally asking for SSDs and an ICYDOCK chassis for my desktop since the HDD died this summer and I never bothered to replace it since the NUC and MBA were still running without issue.
2018-11-14 19:01:07	cdmnky	a small boot ssd would be good too. I don't know what kind of setup I would get though
2018-11-14 19:01:31	cdmnky	a 128GB or even a 64 would be good enough I'd think
2018-11-14 19:02:06	cdmnky	the 860 evos are on sale for $80
2018-11-14 19:03:03	~ben	960 evo tho
2018-11-14 19:03:08	cdmnky	Kingston 128 GB for $30 sounds good
2018-11-14 19:03:22	~ben	i have the 512 gb 960 evo as my desktop's boot drive
2018-11-14 19:03:25	~ben	m.2
2018-11-14 19:03:35	+jan6	boot or system? 64 is enough for /boot imo, 128 probably enough for most of the system itself
2018-11-14 19:04:11	cdmnky	so, mount / on a 128G ssd and /home on my 1TB HDD?
2018-11-14 19:04:16	~ben	/
2018-11-14 19:04:19	~ben	oh wait
2018-11-14 19:04:23	~ben	that's my windows drive
2018-11-14 19:04:31	~ben	linux is on a 240 gb sata ssd
2018-11-14 19:04:42	+jan6	I'd define that as a system drive, then, cdmnky, but yeah, basically
2018-11-14 19:05:43	+jan6	you can put /var or somehting like that also on the hdd, but doesn't matter that much I think
2018-11-14 19:05:55	cdmnky	I can buy used for $23, but idk what I'd feel about a used SSD
2018-11-14 19:06:03	+jan6	yeah
2018-11-14 19:06:23	+jan6	used ssd should never be an "important drive™"
2018-11-14 19:06:40	+jan6	it's fine for a "steam drive" or something like that tho
2018-11-14 19:06:55	cdmnky	better than my old netbook's literal sd card as a main drive
2018-11-14 19:07:00	+jan6	lmao
2018-11-14 19:07:19	cdmnky	64GB emmc drive, mounted as an sd card in puppy linux lol
2018-11-14 19:07:20	+jan6	my laptop sadly won't boot from it's builtin sd card reader :(
2018-11-14 19:07:42	cdmnky	hp rebranded the hardware as a chromebook a year after I got it lol

2018-11-14 19:14:07	cdmnky	nope, false alarm
2018-11-14 19:14:10	amcclure[town]	i think it was the aliens
2018-11-14 19:14:31	cdmnky	it turns out that my area isn't the only place where alcoa left an empty plant and bitcoin mining people wanted to take it over

2018-11-14 19:21:44	~ben	but tilde.chat is now a dns round robin 
2018-11-14 19:21:52	arne	what is that
2018-11-14 19:22:00	~ben	which will resolve to one of the responding servers (on my vps and on yourtilde.com)

2018-11-14 19:52:08	fosslinux_	hadn't thought of ad
2018-11-14 19:52:16	amcclure[town]	proxy should automatically connect
2018-11-14 19:52:16	fosslinux_	do you know how to configure it amcclure[town]
2018-11-14 19:52:31	amcclure[town]	I can't exactly remember how to :(

2018-11-14 19:54:04	fosslinux_	no thank you
2018-11-14 19:54:23	fosslinux_	for some reason on school proxy bing, duckduckgo, anyother search engine than google is blocked
2018-11-14 19:54:23	amcclure[town]	lol
2018-11-14 19:54:30	fosslinux_	school proxy is bad
2018-11-14 19:54:37	amcclure[town]	damn
2018-11-14 19:54:41	+jan6	what about startpage?
2018-11-14 19:54:48	amcclure[town]	any reasons for why it's blocked, or does it just not connect
2018-11-14 19:54:59	+jan6	what about google translate proxy, lol
2018-11-14 19:55:02	fosslinux_	its blocked because i can't rememebr
2018-11-14 19:55:06	fosslinux_	google translate proxy?
2018-11-14 19:55:21	+jan6	google translate proxy is kewl workaround for some blocks
2018-11-14 19:55:51	amcclure[town]	I remember when a nearby school district blocked Google Translate because students were using it as a proxy lol
2018-11-14 19:55:58	+jan6	you put any link into google translate, click the translated version, and try to select a source language that won't change much words
2018-11-14 19:56:00	fosslinux_	lmao
2018-11-14 19:56:04	--	You are now known as fosslinux
2018-11-14 19:56:06	fosslinux	good
2018-11-14 19:56:29	+aewens	amcclure[town]: When I used Google Translate as a proxy my school blocked all of google.com
2018-11-14 19:56:34	fosslinux	omg
2018-11-14 19:56:37	+jan6	lmao
2018-11-14 19:56:37	amcclure[town]	smart IT staff decided that a good way to keep students from cheating was to block *.google.com
2018-11-14 19:56:38	fosslinux	anyway i gtg, cya
2018-11-14 19:56:42	+jan6	lmao
2018-11-14 19:56:46	+jan6	mail.google.com
2018-11-14 19:56:48	+jan6	rip
2018-11-14 19:57:02	+jan6	www.google.com *blocked*
2018-11-14 19:57:04	+aewens	Their blacklist system didn't support blocking subdomains, only top-level-domains.
2018-11-14 19:57:06	+jan6	lol
2018-11-14 19:57:25	+jan6	I bet they turned that off the next day
2018-11-14 19:57:37	amcclure[town]	they eventually unblocked some things since they had a weird google apps for business setup
2018-11-14 19:57:38	+jan6	also what kind of sheitty azz blocker is that?
2018-11-14 19:57:54	+aewens	Nah, the IT people took about a week or two to get around to unblocking it.
2018-11-14 19:58:33	amcclure[town]	their technologies and file hosting setup was bad
2018-11-14 19:58:34	arne	ala
2018-11-14 19:58:51	amcclure[town]	and is why I first set up my own web/file server lol
2018-11-14 19:58:53	+aewens	They had a similar issue when HTTPS adoption hadn't yet taken off and you could dodge the proxy by telling the browser to go to use HTTPS for sites since they were directly blocking the HTTP versions only.
2018-11-14 19:59:19	+aewens	So they blocked all HTTPS usage, i.e. blacklisting https://*
2018-11-14 19:59:36	+aewens	Which broke a good portion of the Internet for another week.
2018-11-14 19:59:47	+aewens	At the school I should say
2018-11-14 19:59:55	amcclure[town]	when I went there they blocked all but HTTP and HTTPS because I was constantly ssh'ing and occasionally downloading with ftp
2018-11-14 20:00:03	amcclure[town]	and they said it was HACKING
2018-11-14 20:00:18	+jan6	lol
2018-11-14 20:00:28	+aewens	Hacking is the word they use to describe anything computer related they don't understand.
2018-11-14 20:00:34	+jan6	anything your grandma can't understand = hacking
2018-11-14 20:00:43	+aewens	s/related they/related thing/
2018-11-14 20:00:43	sedbot	<aewens> Hacking is the word they use to describe anything computer related thing don't understand.
2018-11-14 20:00:58	amcclure[town]	last time I checked, my server's IP was blocked
2018-11-14 20:01:08	+aewens	jan6: In that case, anything outside of turning on the computer is hacking.
2018-11-14 20:01:14	+jan6	indeed
2018-11-14 20:01:15	amcclure[town]	but the filters didn't block domains that pointed to that ip lol
2018-11-14 20:01:52	+jan6	btw, the server I used to ssh into at school (password auth) is now blocked, lol
2018-11-14 20:02:05	+jan6	I'm learning to be IT guy, lol
2018-11-14 20:02:15	arne	my server is not blocked in library lol
2018-11-14 20:02:21	+aewens	jan6: What server were you SSHing into?
2018-11-14 20:02:27	+jan6	jan6.funcity.org
2018-11-14 20:02:38	+jan6	*.funcity.org is now blocked here, it seems
2018-11-14 20:02:49	+aewens	Does it still block it if you use a proxy?
2018-11-14 20:02:58	arne	LOL blocked as pornography in my library
2018-11-14 20:03:18	amcclure[town]	my school created a cycle of 1: get random freenom domain name - 2: school blocks - 3: get block notice and go back to step 1
2018-11-14 20:04:24	+jan6	idk
2018-11-14 20:04:35	arne	awaa
2018-11-14 20:04:35	amcclure[town]	my original server is dead now :( but at least it didn't die when I needed it lol
2018-11-14 20:04:43	+aewens	amcclure[town]: Sounds like the same problem copyright governments had with taking down TPB xD
2018-11-14 20:04:48	+jan6	lol, nice approach amcclure[town] 
2018-11-14 20:04:55	+jan6	tpb?
2018-11-14 20:05:04	+aewens	TPB = The Pirate Bay
2018-11-14 20:05:09	+jan6	k
2018-11-14 20:05:38	+aewens	They'd block their IP address, but TPB was using IPv6 at the time so they'd just get a new IPv6 address and bring it online again.
2018-11-14 20:05:42	+aewens	Rinse and repeat.
2018-11-14 20:05:48	+jan6	hhhhhehh
2018-11-14 20:06:23	arne	lol
2018-11-14 20:07:28	amcclure[town]	they already had blocked thunix as a "proxy" and tilde.town & tilde.team as "security.malware"
2018-11-14 20:07:52	arne	WOw
2018-11-14 20:07:59	amcclure[town]	thunix actually does run a proxy so that block kind of makes sense
2018-11-14 20:08:01	arne	yesterday was my 1st tweeter anniversary
2018-11-14 20:08:11	~ben	oh wow nice
2018-11-14 20:08:30	+aewens	Also, fun tip if you ever get tired of finding new loop holes for schools blocking sites, there's one day that they can do nothing to stop.
2018-11-14 20:08:35	arne	also i hate inspircd
2018-11-14 20:08:51	amcclure[town]	(their blocked site database is provided by a company and is a public internet site so it's fun to look at what all they have blocked)
2018-11-14 20:09:02	+aewens	Just open google.com, use Developer Tools to delete all the HTML and add an iframe pointing to the website you want, make the iframe width and height 100%, done.
2018-11-14 20:09:05	~ben	inspircd is super solid
2018-11-14 20:09:15	+jan6	pff, on't wor with ssh
2018-11-14 20:09:25	amcclure[town]	aewens: didn't work
2018-11-14 20:09:29	+jan6	also they still can block IPs, y'now
2018-11-14 20:09:33	+aewens	amcclure[town]: How so?
2018-11-14 20:09:48	amcclure[town]	the filter they used still blocked it
2018-11-14 20:10:07	+aewens	jan6: Most site blockers only block the IP in the HTTP header, not the one loaded via iframes.
2018-11-14 20:10:37	amcclure[town]	eventually the domain thing got to the point where I found a new way to keep being able to connect to my server and not switch domain names
2018-11-14 20:11:36	amcclure[town]	after switching to the third party filter thing, they couldn't block *.(domain)
2018-11-14 20:12:13	+aewens	Another fun thing you can do is connect your phone to the school's WiFi, use the Fing app to do a netscan to find the IP address of the routers (if they are not something obvious like 192.168.1.1 or 10.1.1.1) and then check to see if they are still using the factory default username / password.
2018-11-14 20:12:31	+aewens	*10.0.0.1
2018-11-14 20:12:52	amcclure[town]	Username: Admin | Password:
2018-11-14 20:13:07	+jan6	in this place, there's no hope of that easy stuff
2018-11-14 20:13:21	+jan6	there are competent people here, y'know
2018-11-14 20:14:23	+aewens	jan6: Competent people sometimes forget to change the password on routers, I've seen it at many companies, even stuff with important nonsense like banks and insurance companies.
2018-11-14 20:14:39	amcclure[town]	rumor has it a few of the machines in the server room including the domain controller were running bitcoin miners
2018-11-14 20:14:53	+jan6	routers won't work here, I can guarantee
2018-11-14 20:15:05	+aewens	Also, it's suprisingly easy to get into the server room for banks if you act nice enough.
2018-11-14 20:15:15	+jan6	lol yeah
2018-11-14 20:15:18	amcclure[town]	lol
2018-11-14 20:15:29	+jan6	that's the fun part of pentesting
2018-11-14 20:15:53	amcclure	lol
2018-11-14 20:15:58	+jan6	"oh, someone just let me through the heavily guarded door cause I was tailgating and wore similar clothes"
2018-11-14 20:16:20	+aewens	I had an on-site job for a company renting out office space in the back of a bank and tried to see if I could get into the bank's server rooms for fun.
2018-11-14 20:16:38	+jan6	and you could, of course
2018-11-14 20:17:10	+aewens	I told them I was here to setup computer equipment and wanted to check their networking equipment to make sure our stuff would be compatible, and she just walked up and unlocked the special door and just let me in.
2018-11-14 20:17:17	+jan6	now, could you have done anything other than kicking them though?
2018-11-14 20:19:07	+jan6	iframe doesn't work, of course, btw
2018-11-14 20:19:52	+jan6	vpn and stuff would, but my goal was chatting @ class, without special setups or keys, and they ruined it for now
2018-11-14 20:20:07	+aewens	Hmm, weird. Guess school monitoring software has gotten more sophisticated since I was there.
2018-11-14 20:20:16	+jan6	you were never here though
2018-11-14 20:20:27	+aewens	I mean in a school.
2018-11-14 20:20:35	+jan6	most schools ARE sheit
2018-11-14 20:20:47	+jan6	IT-wise, if not otherwise
2018-11-14 20:20:49	amcclure	all schools are different, it just matters if they're competent
2018-11-14 20:20:59	amcclure	mine was incompetent lol
2018-11-14 20:21:07	+jan6	as was æwen's
2018-11-14 20:21:37	+aewens	jan6: Do you have a home computer?
2018-11-14 20:21:55	+jan6	well, a laptop, sure
2018-11-14 20:22:48	+aewens	Okay, so my other trick I used to bypass everything was by setting up a VNC server on my home laptop and connecting to it using a VNC client.
2018-11-14 20:22:49	+jan6	and the IP of the subdomain is blocked, btw, not simple dns blocks or stuff
2018-11-14 20:22:59	+jan6	too much hassle
2018-11-14 20:23:02	+aewens	That way you're using the unblocked network of your home.
2018-11-14 20:23:02	nilaky	ah pentest
2018-11-14 20:23:12	nilaky	mmm
2018-11-14 20:23:15	+jan6	nah, not that way home computer
2018-11-14 20:23:49	+aewens	jan6: You can do the same thing with a Raspberry Pi (which was actually the setup I used for awhile).
2018-11-14 20:24:15	arne	boook.land is cool
2018-11-14 20:24:22	arne	im writing there rn
2018-11-14 20:24:23	+aewens	I'd SSH to the Raspberry Pi at home and use it to SSH into other servers from there.
2018-11-14 20:24:24	+jan6	5/7 of a week I'm at school's boarding hostel, which has the same network, probably exact same
2018-11-14 20:25:03	+jan6	my dad has a home server @ home-home, but naah, too much hassle still
2018-11-14 20:25:13	+aewens	And if they ever blocked the IP for my home network, when I got home I'd just adjust the MAC address of the router to move it one town over and it'd work again.
2018-11-14 20:25:31	+jan6	mac address for ip ban?
2018-11-14 20:25:35	+jan6	madlad
2018-11-14 20:25:59	+aewens	When I changed the MAC address the ISP would issue me a new IP address, don't ask me why.
2018-11-14 20:26:33	+aewens	But it worked for dodging IP bans on gaming servers and forums when I would do phishing attacks back in the day.
2018-11-14 20:28:39	amcclure	lol
2018-11-14 20:28:40	+jan6	pff
2018-11-14 20:28:50	+jan6	why WERE you doing phishing?
2018-11-14 20:28:56	amcclure	^
2018-11-14 20:29:25	+jan6	getting free alt accounts to troll on ;P?
2018-11-14 20:29:35	+aewens	To see if I could get admin access to the sites, same reason Kevin Mitnick got into it.
2018-11-14 20:29:40	+jan6	kay
2018-11-14 20:29:54	+jan6	I think I might have heard the name sometime
2018-11-14 20:30:05	+aewens	And once to get back at a guy who ripped me off
2018-11-14 20:30:12	amcclure	oof
2018-11-14 20:30:14	+jan6	that's fair
2018-11-14 20:30:22	+aewens	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick
2018-11-14 20:30:22	TildeBot	Kevin Mitnick - Wikipedia https://bhh.sh/1tc
2018-11-14 20:30:46	+aewens	He was the guy who caused the US government to create the first few "hacking" laws.
2018-11-14 20:31:32	+aewens	He wrote a book about his life getting into hacking and dodging the FBI for years called "Ghost In The Wires", good read.
2018-11-14 20:33:09	+aewens	Also, protip: really bad idea to the same username, email, and password on all your accounts and then proceed to piss off people in the infosec space.
2018-11-14 20:33:16	+jan6	I think that book's whereI heard of him...read only partially tho
2018-11-14 20:33:22	+jan6	yah
2018-11-14 20:33:59	+jan6	I've totally not used absolutely ridiculously easy passwords and same usernames and only like 2 different mails on all my accounts ;P
2018-11-14 20:34:53	+jan6	for f*s sake, my computer's password is literall quadruple a...
2018-11-14 20:35:11	+aewens	I have about 5 email addresses I use, about 15 passwords I keep memorized, use about 5 different usernames, and manage the rest for rando sites in password managers.
2018-11-14 20:35:47	+aewens	And anything that allows it I turn 2FA on
2018-11-14 20:55:39	+jan6	and if your phone is lost
2018-11-14 20:56:00	+aewens	I have two phones, redundancy is important.
2018-11-14 20:56:17	+jan6	and if you lose one and other is stolen or something?
2018-11-14 20:56:30	+jan6	also can you 2fa with multiple phones?
2018-11-14 20:56:54	+aewens	Then I'm having a bad day and whoever stole it is also going to have a bad day since I have GPS tracking set on both of them.
2018-11-14 20:57:06	+aewens	And yes, you can if you use Authy.
2018-11-14 20:57:43	+jan6	unless they're smart and use gps jammers, or just keep them in a concrete brick until they're done with it
2018-11-14 20:59:08	+aewens	At that point, I feel like they've earned it if they are someone able to get my phones from me and have the necessary equipment on hand to block the GPS and cellular signals during the whole process.
2018-11-14 20:59:20	+aewens	They clearly want the phone more than I do.

2018-11-14 22:04:52	mushmouth	you need more defenses aewens !
2018-11-14 22:05:09	+aewens	The best defense is a good offense tho
2018-11-14 22:05:33	+jan6	and the best offense is good defence
2018-11-14 22:05:45	+aewens	See the American military for an example of both
2018-11-14 22:06:06	mushmouth	or see trump 1st election

2018-11-14 22:07:11	+jan6	nah, then you won't be safe anymore
2018-11-14 22:08:38	+jan6	according to almost everyone, there's some kind of powerful being in, or inbetween afterlife, and in any case, the "place after death" is really crowded and "nothing after death" means you wasted a ton of time and energy on killing things

2018-11-14 23:11:00	brendantcc_lounge	what's been happenin', everyone?
2018-11-14 23:11:22	+aewens	I went to the dentist today, does that count?
2018-11-14 23:11:36	+aewens	Otherwise, it's been a very boring day today.
2018-11-14 23:12:29	brendantcc_lounge	lol rip
2018-11-14 23:12:32	brendantcc_lounge	so no work?
2018-11-14 23:12:52	+aewens	I'm at work, just there's been nothing to do for hours, so I'm working on some automation scripts to pass the time.
2018-11-14 23:14:38	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-14 23:14:52	brendantcc_lounge	you could ask if you could leave early? idk
2018-11-14 23:15:15	+aewens	I could, but my boss is not here because he's at a conference going on this week.
2018-11-14 23:15:20	brendantcc_lounge	rip
2018-11-14 23:15:25	+aewens	Along with the whole sales team here.
2018-11-14 23:15:28	brendantcc_lounge	who's in charge currently?
2018-11-14 23:15:57	+aewens	Plus, getting paid to talk on IRC while I monitor the ticketing system and idlely write automation scripts isn't the worst thing in the world.
2018-11-14 23:16:11	nilaky	aewens: 23:15:49 weechat =!= | No help available, "cs" is not a command or an option

2018-11-14 23:16:39	+aewens	Umm, technically the Vice President of Operations, but she doesn't really directly manage anything when bossman is gone.
2018-11-14 23:16:47	brendantcc_lounge	lol...
2018-11-14 23:16:54	brendantcc_lounge	what do you do for a living btw?
2018-11-14 23:17:05	+aewens	She did plan out ordering lunch for all of us tomorrow while half the team is gone, so there's that.
2018-11-14 23:17:14	brendantcc_lounge	well thats a bonus
2018-11-14 23:17:17	nilaky	pfft
2018-11-14 23:17:18	brendantcc_lounge	her shout, or...?
2018-11-14 23:17:36	nilaky	"well as long as i can be lazy about it, i'll order you lunch" nice
2018-11-14 23:17:48	+aewens	I'm a systems engineer for a company that sells supercomputers to universities, research companies, and government agencies.
2018-11-14 23:18:01	brendantcc_lounge	OH WOW
2018-11-14 23:18:07	brendantcc_lounge	i expect that'd pay a lot
2018-11-14 23:18:27	nilaky	I'd hope so, it's an in-demand field..
2018-11-14 23:18:44	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-14 23:18:45	+aewens	It paid a lot better than my last job, so yeah. Full benefits and all of that.
2018-11-14 23:19:11	nilaky	(also hi, im a software development engineer for a big company, considering shifting to systems)
2018-11-14 23:19:27	+aewens	I have a 401K, insurance, and enough money to live in a house with a yard and driveway. It pays the bills.
2018-11-14 23:19:34	brendantcc_lounge	(why not go for a job where aewens works, nilaky?)
2018-11-14 23:19:48	nilaky	lol
2018-11-14 23:20:11	nilaky	no i mean my manager wants me to swap roles, we have a few sysde's and one of them wants my role, looks nice and clean to my manager if we swap lol
2018-11-14 23:20:37	+aewens	(I used to want to do software development, then realized I enjoy systems engineering more as a job than writing code I don't want to write)
2018-11-14 23:20:48	nilaky	also my wife doesn't much want to move, which is why i'm not doing the house/yard/car thing yet
2018-11-14 23:21:02	brendantcc_lounge	(but hey at least you're writing code you want to now, aewens!)
2018-11-14 23:21:11	brendantcc_lounge	(also, why are we whispering?)
2018-11-14 23:21:17	nilaky	currently, i feel like big sys projects > big soft projects
2018-11-14 23:21:26	nilaky	lots of other stuff, not in mood to list it
2018-11-14 23:21:39	brendantcc_lounge	i'm making a profile for a friend of mine with html
2018-11-14 23:21:49	+aewens	Yeah, I've somehow convinced my boss that I should work on projects I enjoy and he's cool with it. Every day I wonder when someone will notice that my job is far too cushy for my own good.
2018-11-14 23:22:00	nilaky	also idk how to say it humbly, but I work for a pretty big company, and they pay me in stocks i've been here long enough
2018-11-14 23:22:26	+aewens	Would I know the name of that big company?
2018-11-14 23:22:29	nilaky	like, my wife and i have been living pretty comfortably off just salary, so the stock has been accumulating
2018-11-14 23:22:40	nilaky	I'd be absolutely blown away if you did not
2018-11-14 23:23:30	brendantcc_lounge	mmmmicrohard? :P
2018-11-14 23:23:33	 *	nilaky has too much fun talking about this, kind of feels like it's not a good idea to continue >.<
2018-11-14 23:23:54	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-14 23:23:54	+aewens	Nice xD and the company I'm at is small, just 12 of us here, but we sell HPC systems to most three letter acronym agencies, military, and most universities in the country.
2018-11-14 23:24:12	nilaky	I also go back and forth really far, i've been really open about it, but clamped back down again recently
2018-11-14 23:24:46	+aewens	I get it, I can understand why you wouldn't want to throw your company name around on the Internet.
2018-11-14 23:24:54	nilaky	do they tell you which three-letter agencies? it's really weird noone will confirm which ones we work with, but i know there's at least one
2018-11-14 23:25:09	nilaky	it's out there tho, idunno how much holding back helps
2018-11-14 23:25:25	+aewens	There's literally a page on our intranet with every customer, purchase order, and how much we made from it here, so yeah.
2018-11-14 23:25:42	brendantcc_lounge	aewens: check pms
2018-11-14 23:27:01	+aewens	checked
2018-11-14 23:27:29	+aewens	nilaky: The caveat is that we have no clue what they do with said machines once they get them.
2018-11-14 23:27:33	brendantcc_lounge	☑️
2018-11-14 23:27:50	nilaky	lewd stuff, i hope
2018-11-14 23:28:25	+aewens	It's funny getting support calls from some of them since they will only work with me over the phone and won't send any information about the machines, regardless of how benign it is.
2018-11-14 23:29:27	+aewens	Or when a guy routing calls from submarines gets a call from a tech onboard and wants my input. No way to ask the tech on-board and the delay is about a week. Really puts my troubleshooting skills to the test.
2018-11-14 23:29:34	 *	brendantcc_lounge tries to move aewens' attention to the pms

2018-11-15 00:23:52	nilaky	i have a mumble bot that's doing it, i'd recommend you don't host it on a shared place, compiling ffmpeg is obnoxious, don't forget the SSL, etc etc
2018-11-15 00:24:14	@khuxkm	yeah
2018-11-15 00:24:24	@khuxkm	but that can come later
2018-11-15 00:24:41	nilaky	i mean, if you're gonna put it on radio, is it really sotd anymore, or are you just labelling the radio audit log "sotd" cuz that's a simpler project and a bit easier to use

2018-11-15 17:19:23	+jan6	also, ben, have you setup mosh on alternate ports as well? might want to...
2018-11-15 17:20:12	+jan6	it's nice to ssh on 80 and 443, but why not mosh as well? afaik mosh uses udp, while ssh uses tcp, so probably possible on the same ip even
2018-11-15 17:20:44	erxeto	ok, I have it working, the nasty way :-/
2018-11-15 17:21:02	~ben	wym
2018-11-15 17:21:08	erxeto	maybe another day I'll try to find out why it crashes when usiung "the right way ™"
2018-11-15 17:21:09	~ben	mosh uses 60000-61000
2018-11-15 17:22:09	+jan6	and if those are blocked?
2018-11-15 17:22:20	~ben	that's what mosh uses idk
2018-11-15 17:22:25	~ben	then you use ssh on 80 or 443
2018-11-15 17:23:01	+jan6	       -p PORT[:PORT2]
2018-11-15 17:23:03	+jan6	              UDP port number or port-range to bind.  -p 0 will let the  oper‐
2018-11-15 17:23:05	+jan6	              ating system pick an available UDP port.
2018-11-15 17:23:48	+jan6	so you can have mosh bind to port 80 UDP, and have ssh on 80 and 443 TCP, so you can mosh behind port blocks
2018-11-15 17:24:08	+jan6	that's from mosh-server manpage
2018-11-15 17:24:20	+jan6	the client also has a -p to match the server
2018-11-15 17:24:44	~ben	mosh starts a server per user
2018-11-15 17:25:01	~ben	so basically you can use any unused port above 1024
2018-11-15 17:25:09	~ben	(that's also open on the firewall)
2018-11-15 17:25:38	~ben	no way to bind per-protocol
2018-11-15 17:25:52	+jan6	what I'm saying is that for me, basically all ports are closed @ school net, which means I cannot mosh 5/7 of the week
2018-11-15 17:25:52	~ben	without port multiplexing
2018-11-15 17:26:29	~ben	is the ping that bad that you need mosh?
2018-11-15 17:26:34	+jan6	nah
2018-11-15 17:26:55	+jan6	just annoyed with having to restart ssh every day + every time I open the computer
2018-11-15 17:27:22	mushmouth	that why i just got it on a vps
2018-11-15 17:27:34	mushmouth	and a alias
2018-11-15 17:27:34	~ben	?
2018-11-15 17:27:35	+jan6	you still gotta get to that vps
2018-11-15 17:27:37	+jan6	lol
2018-11-15 17:27:44	+jan6	doesn't solve a thing
2018-11-15 17:27:45	~ben	that doesn't fix the problem lol
2018-11-15 17:27:48	+jan6	^
2018-11-15 17:27:53	mushmouth	there no real better solution
2018-11-15 17:28:01	+jan6	that's not a solution at all tho
2018-11-15 17:28:29	+jan6	it's like saying "I can't drive a car to work, so I rent a car and drive to work"
2018-11-15 17:28:32	~ben	i'll look into it, but i can't think of anything other than buying another ip and figuring out a way to allow mosh to bind to ports below 1024
2018-11-15 17:29:05	+jan6	setuid mosh-server, no way that could backfire ;P
2018-11-15 17:29:31	~ben	yeah that's not gonna happen
2018-11-15 17:31:04	+jan6	I guess possibly change one of 80 or 443 to mosh, if you can't have it be per-transport?
2018-11-15 17:32:21	+jan6	I personally would have 80 = mosh, 443 = ssh, I think?
2018-11-15 17:32:46	+jan6	it's not critical anyway
2018-11-15 17:32:55	+jan6	just wondered
2018-11-15 17:46:00	mushmouth	jan6: this is me being a little dumb. but what the issue with having mosh and ssh on same port?
2018-11-15 17:46:22	mushmouth	wouldn't it be less ports to open on server?
2018-11-15 17:46:29	+jan6	^
2018-11-15 17:47:15	+jan6	I guess you can't have different UDP and TCP routings, is b€n's problem?
2018-11-15 17:47:55	+jan6	mosh uses udp, ssh tcp, afaik

2018-11-15 18:55:32	cdmnky	there was a dusting two days ago and I overheard someone who crashed their mustang because they didn't get winter tires
2018-11-15 18:56:09	cdmnky	it's the ice that i'm worried about. the only reason why the snowfall totals aren't higher is that it'll be sleeting all night
2018-11-15 18:56:35	cdmnky	I really like when that top thin layer of snow is all frozen, so it breaks up in little flat chunks when it crunches

2018-11-15 19:31:26	+aewens	Yeah, I just reordered the parsing so that IRC commands written in chat won't be parsed as actual IRC commands.
2018-11-15 19:32:06	+aewens	I thought I fixed that earlier, but I forgot to move the ":Closing link:" check one level down when I added it as a quick bug fix for a previous issue.
2018-11-15 19:32:10	sebboh	yep, and you did it for the general case, not just that one kind of service notice.
2018-11-15 19:32:18	sebboh	ah
2018-11-15 19:33:06	+aewens	It ran into an issue whenever ben would restart tilde.news and BabiliBot would freak out and get overloaded, so it couldn't respond to the PING requests in time.
2018-11-15 19:34:12	+aewens	Which then caused the Closing link message to come up and it would hang, so I fixed that by putting a checker to see if that message shows up, and if so to restart it's socket connection with the IRC.
2018-11-15 19:35:30	sebboh	sounds like a queue issue. in the old c-lang IRC bot that I based my dicebot and acrobot on (literally 20 years ago?) there was a queue system with different queues for handling in-game stuff vs server-level stuff like PING.
2018-11-15 19:36:12	cdmnky	heads up, humble bundle is giving away free steam keys for Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion if you sign up for their newsletter and link your steam account
2018-11-15 19:36:48	sebboh	It wasn't perfect.  A single in-game operation that took a long time would block PING response... It was single threaded, you see... but multiple in-game messages wouldn't block it, because it would clear the whole server queue before going to the next item in the game queue.

2018-11-15 19:58:00	cdmnky	I'm gonna try Fallout 1 on it (I haven't played it since I got it for free last year
2018-11-15 19:58:12	cdmnky	apparently Fallout 2 is going free in December
2018-11-15 19:58:20	+aewens	I still find it bizarre that Bethesda will port Skyrim to every out platform *but* Linux.
2018-11-15 19:59:04	fosslinux	does anyone know of a way to reorder weechat buffers?
2018-11-15 19:59:31	cdmnky	or resize the userlist
2018-11-15 19:59:46	sebboh	aewens: how many platforms is "every platform", in the world of games?
2018-11-15 19:59:47	+aewens	Close all the buffers after it, join the buffer, add back the other buffers ;)
2018-11-15 19:59:56	fosslinux	oof
2018-11-15 19:59:59	fosslinux	hmm
2018-11-15 20:00:05	fosslinux	idk if i should bother
2018-11-15 20:00:18	sebboh	/buffer move 3
2018-11-15 20:00:38	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-15 20:00:39	sebboh	where 3 is some position.  the current "3" will be moved down.
2018-11-15 20:00:44	fosslinux	thanks sebboh
2018-11-15 20:00:56	sebboh	/buffer unmerge 
2018-11-15 20:01:01	sebboh	...is a thing too
2018-11-15 20:01:21	fosslinux	does what?
2018-11-15 20:02:28	+aewens	sebboh: There's Windows, Mac, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Alexa of all things
2018-11-15 20:02:43	sebboh	be default, your weechat buffer (probably buffer 1) has more than one thing in it.  Personally, I don't like that, so I select that buffer then unmerge it.  ... over and over again, because being lazy makes you poor and CLASS MOBILITY IS A MYTH
2018-11-15 20:02:44	@khuxkm|lounge	alexa?
2018-11-15 20:02:52	@khuxkm|lounge	you mean amazon?

2018-11-15 20:03:07	@khuxkm|lounge	hmmst
2018-11-15 20:03:09	cdmnky	nope, fallout 1 just crashes immediately lol
2018-11-15 20:03:11	+aewens	Yeah, I mean Amazon Alexa.
2018-11-15 20:04:07	~ben	henlo
2018-11-15 20:04:09	cdmnky	of course there's no debug output at all
2018-11-15 20:05:24	sebboh	I screwed up my joke there.  ...I meant to say that I don't have time to make a real weechat config and I don't have time because I spend all my time manually moving buffers around... something something poor vs lazy vs poor BECAUSE lazy. *shrug* It's not important.
2018-11-15 20:07:27	+aewens	I think the important thing here is that CLASS MOBILITY IS A MYTH
2018-11-15 20:08:48	sebboh	cdmnky: I haven't tried Proton but previous versions of Steam on Linux  .. uh, leave much to be desired.  The startup scripts for terraria, for example.. don't do what the script authors think they do.  You can tell by reading them.  Also there are muliple, different copies of the executable... also random mix of 64-bit vs 32bit.. also they ship various libraries that my system already has and
2018-11-15 20:08:50	sebboh	then cram them into the environment of the executable in the most crude of ways, but dropping them into the executable's CWD or some such.  Ugh... I started to clean mine up but then I realized that it's always auto-updating...
2018-11-15 20:09:39	sebboh	s/but d/by d/
2018-11-15 20:09:39	sedbot	<sebboh> then cram them into the environment of the executable in the most crude of ways, by dropping them into the executable's CWD or some such.  Ugh... I started to clean mine up but then I realized that it's always auto-updating...
2018-11-15 20:10:10	cdmnky	if only I could see what was wrong. ususally it's a missing library that crashes games like that
2018-11-15 20:10:31	cdmnky	ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/$LIB/libgpg-error.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored. is all I get
2018-11-15 20:11:26	+aewens	cdmnky: Always good to check the tail end of `dmesg` for hidden errors.
2018-11-15 20:12:28	cdmnky	nothing out of the ordinary there, just the normal systemd init stuff
2018-11-15 20:12:36	sebboh	cdmnky: looks like $LIB isn't getting expanded there...  First off do `find /usr -name libgpf-error.so` to find where that file really lives.  Then search all your Steam directories for shell scripts that contain the word $LIB ... I guess? 
2018-11-15 20:13:28	+aewens	He could also do `locate libgpg-error.so` to see if it's on the system.
2018-11-15 20:13:29	sebboh	and/or find the command line that the steam client invokes when it starts the game.   via ps aux or whatnot.
2018-11-15 20:13:40	cdmnky	yeah, but it ignored it, so it couldn't have been the problem. the prompt returned back to normal, then "loading fallout" showed up, and then on the client, it said running for a split second before it stopped
2018-11-15 20:14:33	cdmnky	that's why, lib32-gpg-error wasn't installed
2018-11-15 20:15:13	cdmnky	on arch anyway, it only uses 32 bit libraries
2018-11-15 20:15:33	~ben	/script install autosort.py
2018-11-15 20:15:35	~ben	done
2018-11-15 20:15:49	~ben	sebboh: cdmnky ^^
2018-11-15 20:16:25	sebboh	do you know the name of all your steam directories?  like probably ~/.config/steam or something?  Maybe ~/.Steam?  something like that.. do `find ~/.your-steam-directories ~/.all-of-them -mmin -20` to find files modified in the past 20 minutes.  And of them a log file?  
2018-11-15 20:16:36	sebboh	s/And o/Any o/

2018-11-15 20:18:45	~ben	what about something like https://github.com/lrvick/dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/win
2018-11-15 20:18:58	~ben	run windows in qemu and pass your gpu over
2018-11-15 20:19:14	~ben	skip proton/wine/etc
2018-11-15 20:19:42	sebboh	Windows isn't free software, Proton is.
2018-11-15 20:19:44	cdmnky	complicated lol
2018-11-15 20:19:52	sebboh	where does autosort.py live?
2018-11-15 20:20:18	cdmnky	the game itself was designed for windows 95, so it was iffy on windows to begin with
2018-11-15 20:20:52	cdmnky	iirc classic fallout calls on some dos stuff
2018-11-15 20:21:34	cdmnky	i'm gonna try that sins game now, since I got a free key for it
2018-11-15 20:22:18	+aewens	cdmnky: Also something to note about Proton/Steam Play, if a game was not released with support for Steam Play you'll get mixed results.
2018-11-15 20:22:44	cdmnky	yeah, i was hoping, but i wasn't getting my hopes up either
2018-11-15 20:22:47	~ben	sebboh: it's a weechat script

2018-11-15 20:26:31	cdmnky	nice! it works perfectly on my laptop!
2018-11-15 20:26:58	cdmnky	if that's the case, it looks like I'm gonna be playing it tonight
2018-11-15 20:32:29	+jan6	"if a game was not released with support for Steam Play" well, it IS wine after all, not magic
2018-11-15 20:32:43	+jan6	a lot of stuff works, but some still doesn't

2018-11-16 04:00:31	~ben	deepend: i think we need to move the round robin host to a subdomain
2018-11-16 04:00:50	~ben	having the round robin host as the root domain is a PITA for the website
2018-11-16 04:01:47	~ben	what about irc.tilde.chat
2018-11-16 04:01:52	~ben	or chat.tilde.chat
2018-11-16 04:01:54	~ben	lol
2018-11-16 04:02:02	~deepend	i agree.. but having the website available on all is great for uptime lol 
2018-11-16 04:02:11	~ben	deepend: yeah, that's true
2018-11-16 04:02:13	~ben	but still
2018-11-16 04:02:13	~deepend	irc.tilde.chat is what I usually go for
2018-11-16 04:02:18	~ben	it's not with the headache
2018-11-16 04:02:30	~ben	i'm going to set that up then
2018-11-16 04:02:37	~ben	and make the update to the website
2018-11-16 04:02:38	~deepend	just need an automated way to sync all nodes is all .. for website that is
2018-11-16 04:02:47	~ben	that irc.tilde.chat is the round-robin host
2018-11-16 04:03:01	~ben	otherwise tilde.chat 6697 will end up as the de-facto host
2018-11-16 04:03:11	mushmouth	deepend: and maybe a status page on all connected tildes?
2018-11-16 04:03:40	~deepend	probably could do that.. 
2018-11-16 04:07:23	~deepend	so that means I no longer need website for tilde.chat on my server?
2018-11-16 04:08:00	~ben	yeah you won't need the website
2018-11-16 04:08:39	~deepend	well.. boring lol :D

2018-11-16 15:21:25	~ben	morning 
2018-11-16 15:21:35	~ben	yes, thunix.tilde.chat is up :)
2018-11-16 15:22:03	~ben	erxeto: what were you thinking for redundancy of other services?
2018-11-16 15:22:52	erxeto	it depends on the budget and waht's available at hetzner
2018-11-16 15:23:25	~ben	i guess i'm not sure what's kind of availability we're looking for
2018-11-16 15:23:39	~ben	like some kind of situation where hetzner would be down?
2018-11-16 15:23:50	erxeto	well that's the main point, define the requisites
2018-11-16 15:23:56	erxeto	I would not aim for that
2018-11-16 15:24:07	~ben	yeah that's a bit overkill 
2018-11-16 15:24:09	erxeto	you can assume an enitre provider can give you a good uptime
2018-11-16 15:24:19	~ben	i'd be ok with adding a vps or two
2018-11-16 15:24:26	erxeto	is more particular services, or even the entire machine
2018-11-16 15:26:07	erxeto	if floating ips are a possiblity something like pacemaker+corosync would be good. But if you can have a dns provider that offers sufficiently low ttl and can do "master-slave" (like r53 or others) you can do the HA entry point there
2018-11-16 15:26:34	erxeto	there are tons of possibilities, but it all depends on how much time is ok to be down, and which services
2018-11-16 15:27:54	~ben	that's fair
2018-11-16 15:28:12	~ben	i'll need to get a proper list going of all the services that run on the tilde.team box
2018-11-16 15:28:19	erxeto	hehehehe
2018-11-16 15:28:33	erxeto	you buy domains and spawn services without measure :-P
2018-11-16 15:28:46	~ben	lol i sure do
2018-11-16 15:28:51	~ben	a bit haphazadly
2018-11-16 15:29:07	~ben	i wouldn't mind grabbing an auction server
2018-11-16 15:29:24	~ben	there's one for 24eur/mo with an i7, 6tb hdd, and 16gb ram
2018-11-16 15:29:42	~ben	desktop hardware but that's ok
2018-11-16 15:30:49	erxeto	I guess a list of most used ~team services with a % of "sla" is a good starting point.
2018-11-16 15:31:09	erxeto	from there some HA strategy can be drawn.
2018-11-16 15:31:45	erxeto	there's no point in investing time on something 3 users use and can be down for 24h without anybody noticing fonr instance

2018-11-16 15:33:40	~ben	some of these are only dependent on nginx
2018-11-16 15:36:40	erxeto	maybe I'm wrong, but the basics would be the webs, masto,pleroma and irc ?
2018-11-16 15:36:54	erxeto	I mean, the resta could be down for some hours right ?
2018-11-16 15:38:02	amcclure	why dependent on nginx
2018-11-16 15:38:13	amcclure	lol
2018-11-16 15:38:30	severak	i think that most important thing is to run status page from some very different service. AKA when tilde.chat goes down to some hetzner bug, I will fire status.tilde.chat and it will show some message about current status. That status page can be even hosted on github, it doesn't matter.
2018-11-16 15:42:31	+aewens	Yeah, you can do that using a CNAME record and GitHub Pages (or GitLab's version if you have something against GitHub).
2018-11-16 15:44:41	amcclure	what's the difference between github and gitlab
2018-11-16 15:48:13	mushmouth	gitlab opensource at least for the consumer version
2018-11-16 15:48:17	mushmouth	github owned by microsoft
2018-11-16 15:48:54	amcclure	o
2018-11-16 15:51:32	mushmouth	the github owned by microsoft is a big deal for me
2018-11-16 15:51:37	mushmouth	but im not a huge git fan to begin with
2018-11-16 15:51:44	mushmouth	much prefer hg or cvs
2018-11-16 15:59:07	mushmouth	i don't agree with git
2018-11-16 15:59:20	amcclure	I prefer cvs more too
2018-11-16 16:00:37	mushmouth	because git seems like the systemd of control systems
2018-11-16 16:00:57	mushmouth	too much to take in and remember
2018-11-16 16:01:06	kirch	github was bought by MS
2018-11-16 16:02:07	severak	mushmouth: exactly, for me git is unusable without some wrapper over it

2018-11-16 16:12:45	~ben	git is definitely a bit of a mess
2018-11-16 16:12:54	~ben	more stockholm syndrome i guess
2018-11-16 16:12:58	~ben	i'm so used to it now
2018-11-16 16:14:37	mushmouth	ben: i actually made a joke about somebody using gif as a spec for a new control system
2018-11-16 16:14:42	mushmouth	scary part somebody might try it
2018-11-16 16:14:51	mushmouth	and it probably possible

2018-11-16 16:32:42	~ben	a heading? like an <h#> tag?

2018-11-16 17:11:08	+aewens	Fair enough, I'd probably include that information on the status.* sites
2018-11-16 17:12:19	+aewens	Which the easiest way to add that would be to make a Git(Hub|Lab) Page, point the CNAME to it and then have your other X domain's status subdomain redirect to the same page.

2018-11-16 17:21:43	+aewens	Sure, but that'd imply having a whole other server for this, the Git* Pages don't require that assumption. If you have a server ready-to-go already for the status pages, go for it.

2018-11-16 17:27:50	~ben	i see what you mean

2018-11-16 17:28:28	+jan6	for the live status
2018-11-16 17:28:53	+jan6	something like ping once per 2 hours, would be fine, probably

2018-11-16 17:31:03	~ben	already have an org for it
2018-11-16 17:31:09	+jan6	eh sure
2018-11-16 17:31:19	+jan6	just would be easier to manage if it was all in one place

2018-11-16 17:31:41	+aewens	Yeah, but why manage one thing when you can manage two? Twice the fun! /s

2018-11-16 17:45:44	amcclure	nice
2018-11-16 17:46:11	~ben	tbh i wasn't really planning on changing anything 
2018-11-16 17:46:13	~ben	lol
2018-11-16 17:46:18	~ben	and just set the topic in #tilde.team on freenode
2018-11-16 17:47:31	+aewens	Well, I guess you wouldn't really need to use gmt for your case, just setup another remote location using git and just push to one and then the other for any changes.
2018-11-16 17:48:04	~ben	they don't have a shared history
2018-11-16 17:48:08	~ben	can't push unrelated histories
2018-11-16 17:48:30	~ben	plus i just dropped it in with the web editor

2018-11-16 17:49:31	cdmnky	it has haiku OS clipboard support, I found that interesting
2018-11-16 17:49:51	+aewens	I guess on principle you can keep them separate. I'd just clone one to my machine, blow away the .git directory, re-initialize it, delete both the existing repos in GitHub and push it back from your local version so you can update them both from your local version for any future changes.
2018-11-16 17:50:26	+aewens	But you do you
2018-11-16 17:51:02	~ben	i wasn't planning on making any changes but ok
2018-11-16 17:51:29	~ben	force push one to the other would be easy enough i guess
2018-11-16 17:52:21	+aewens	Well, you also didn't plan for hetzner to take down ~team the other day. The whole point of the status pages are because stuff you don't plan on happening might happen ;)
2018-11-16 17:53:45	~ben	then i'll just wait for people to join #tilde.team on freenode and set the topic
2018-11-16 17:55:14	cdmnky	I haven't gone to freenode before
2018-11-16 17:55:49	+aewens	That encourages more of an "are we there yet" kind of mentality from being in an environment where X people are able to lively ask when the server is back, vs a billboard saying "Hetzner tooks us down for X" *later* "Hetzner said we will be back in X time units"
2018-11-16 17:56:54	+jan6	^
2018-11-16 17:57:08	+jan6	are we there yet *10 min later* are we there yet?
2018-11-16 17:57:32	~ben	huh?
2018-11-16 17:58:58	+aewens	In short: If ~team is down, it'd be better if your attention was towards getting the server back online, not answering 20 questions from every new user entering the chat with "~team back when?". Updating the status.* page with those updates works for this and the rest of us in the IRC can point people that way if need be.
2018-11-16 18:00:29	~ben	as i said, i'd just set the topic and hop in there if needed
2018-11-16 18:00:52	~ben	no need to re-answer something that's in the topic imo
2018-11-16 18:01:23	~ben	anyone else in there is welcome to answer questions
2018-11-16 18:02:08	+jan6	do you really expect people to READ THE TOPIC?
2018-11-16 18:02:20	+jan6	what are you, not been on irc enough?
2018-11-16 18:05:41	~ben	well in this case i would expect that

2018-11-16 18:09:32	+aewens	ben: When your house is on fire you don't check to news on the TV reporting on the fire, you're scared and looking for a way out of the house. Same way when user12345 cannot log into their favorite shared server, they aren't going to stop to read the topic (do you see how far away the topic is from the chat box? eons away!), they're going to storm in demanding answers they feel entitled to.
2018-11-16 18:10:35	~ben	and they'd be more likely to read a status page than a topic?
2018-11-16 18:11:20	+aewens	How did they even get to the IRC page? From that status page. Especially if you put on the status pages "this page will be updated with new information when we have it" or something like that.

2018-11-16 21:49:16	+aewens	Speaking of "the kilogram", I'm surprised there hasn't been some nerdy heist to take it for ransom. If anything, I want this to happen so I can watch a cringy re-enactment of it from hollywood.
2018-11-16 21:50:00	~ben	lmao

2018-11-16 21:51:58	+aewens	    The kilogram – will be defined by the Planck constant (h)
2018-11-16 21:52:00	+aewens	    The ampere – will be defined by the elementary electrical charge (e)
2018-11-16 21:52:02	+aewens	    The kelvin – will be defined by the Boltzmann constant (k)
2018-11-16 21:52:04	+aewens	    The mole – will be defined by the Avogadro constant (NA)

2018-11-16 22:29:34	+aewens	However, do provide an email of some sort if people want to talk about your blogs with you if you care about that kind of stuff.

2018-11-16 22:31:00	+aewens	Exactly, comments leave the expectation for comments, where blogging should be for it's own sake.
2018-11-16 22:31:07	+jan6	yes, but authenticate us
2018-11-16 22:31:24	+jan6	but tbh, comment sections are barren

2018-11-16 22:33:48	+aewens	It's a comment section to the webpage.

2018-11-16 23:42:16	+tomasino	you saw the note about the cyoa podcast?
2018-11-16 23:43:01	~ben	the podcast url?
2018-11-16 23:43:03	~ben	yeah
2018-11-16 23:43:17	~ben	i tried to download last night's show and it was taking forever
2018-11-16 23:43:21	mushmouth	hey ben i have a interest to do like rants with audio only
2018-11-16 23:43:29	mushmouth	on various subjects
2018-11-16 23:43:31	+tomasino	it's pulling from anonradio archives
2018-11-16 23:43:33	mushmouth	im just wondering if i should do them
2018-11-16 23:43:41	~ben	yeah i saw that
2018-11-16 23:43:45	~ben	go ahead!
2018-11-16 23:43:54	~ben	you could do a show on tilderadio
2018-11-16 23:43:59	~ben	make it a podcast from the archyives
2018-11-16 23:44:02	+tomasino	that sounded like the least problematic place to do it. i could host it all on my pi, but why... and i could put it on team, but then i'm taking up team's space
2018-11-16 23:44:25	+tomasino	i'm very much planning on dual-casting anonradio & tilderadio for CYOA
2018-11-16 23:44:28	+tomasino	maybe then
2018-11-16 23:44:37	+tomasino	but i've not spent the time to see if i can run two butt's
2018-11-16 23:44:40	+tomasino	lets try!
2018-11-16 23:47:50	~ben	i'm trying to shoot for a soft 1gb limit on ~team
2018-11-16 23:48:08	~ben	but the archive.tilderadio.org server should be far faster
2018-11-16 23:48:26	+tomasino	anyone know how to test an anonradio stream when it's not up on the main mount?
2018-11-16 23:48:29	+tomasino	i forget

2018-11-17 00:40:38	amcclure	I asked for an a name record to hexhaxtron's server ip and 1 .conf file and certbot, a tildeverse node, and takedown on a 200-bot spambot service
2018-11-17 00:40:41	amcclure	here we are
2018-11-17 00:40:49	amcclure	in #meta on tildeverse
2018-11-17 00:41:05	amcclure	reading amcclure's messages while amcclure talks in 3rd person

2018-11-17 00:43:14	brendantcc_lounge	that's a lot to do...
2018-11-17 00:43:25	amcclure	not really lol
2018-11-17 00:43:55	~ben	just a normal day in the tildeverse
2018-11-17 00:44:09	amcclure	everyday activities
2018-11-17 00:44:30	~ben	vhosts and certbot are pretty standard
2018-11-17 00:44:36	~ben	but not with wildcard certs ;)
2018-11-17 00:44:39	amcclure	there was a spambot service ran by an inactive user on thunix
2018-11-17 00:45:00	~ben	yeah that was fun
2018-11-17 00:50:08	amcclure	since they connected to port 6667 and tildeverse node uses port 6667 and 6697, there was a short period of time they connected to several fake channels.
2018-11-17 00:50:33	amcclure	This has been dealt with and shouldn't be a problem anymore.
2018-11-17 00:53:21	~ben	amcclure: you might want to change the <bind> block for 6667 to be localhost-only
2018-11-17 00:57:25	~deepend	what if 6667 is wanted ? :D  lol
2018-11-17 00:58:16	amcclure	lol
2018-11-17 01:02:43	~ben	it'd be nice to have external connections on ssl only
2018-11-17 01:03:09	amcclure	set <bind> for 6667 as localhost only
2018-11-17 01:03:17	amcclure	does that affect 6697 (ssl)?
2018-11-17 01:03:48	~deepend	6697 would be a seperate bind line.. so woulnd't affect it 
2018-11-17 01:04:39	~ben	yeah 6697 is in a separate bind block
2018-11-17 01:08:22	brendantcc_lounge	i made a system error page! yay!

2018-11-17 01:35:33	giacomo	such protocol, FP - file protocol, is the reason why Jehanne exists in the first place
2018-11-17 01:36:34	giacomo	so basically, after 3 years, I've just started exploring the funny part...
2018-11-17 01:36:44	giacomo	just to give an idea :-)

2018-11-17 19:11:14	~ben	nice lazy saturday so far
2018-11-17 19:11:20	tildebeast	the best kind :)
2018-11-17 19:12:31	~ben	slept in too lol
2018-11-17 19:12:36	~ben	not as long as last saturday
2018-11-17 19:12:40	~ben	but still 
2018-11-17 19:13:59	tildebeast	heh
2018-11-17 19:14:36	tildebeast	wish i'd had the chance but my daughter was up bright and early after coming back from her school residential week. ugh...
2018-11-17 19:15:03	~ben	so she stays at the school during the week?
2018-11-17 19:15:40	tildebeast	no, it was a class holiday of sorts at an outdoor centre, down in Exmoor (north Devon, SW England...)
2018-11-17 19:16:23	tildebeast	so dorms, early starts, archery, building shelters, cooking and eating the weaker team members, that kind of thing 
2018-11-17 19:16:56	tildebeast	i envision Lord Of The Flies but with a little adult supervision :)
2018-11-17 19:17:11	~ben	woah that's pretty cool
2018-11-17 19:17:15	~ben	a week or so?
2018-11-17 19:17:32	~ben	we did a similar thing in 5th grade iirc
2018-11-17 19:17:36	tildebeast	she loved it. came back brimful of confidence so something had to work.
2018-11-17 19:17:49	~ben	5 days at a camp doing similar stuff
2018-11-17 19:17:51	~ben	that's awesome :)
2018-11-17 19:17:52	tildebeast	i don't know the equivalent grade over there. she's 10 going on 11, what would that be?
2018-11-17 19:18:10	tildebeast	wish we'd done similar when i was a kid!
2018-11-17 19:18:40	~ben	um that would be about the same age
2018-11-17 19:19:07	~ben	the school years are k-12, where k is kindergarten (just what we call the first year of school at age 5)
2018-11-17 19:19:18	tildebeast	you've got plenty of real wilderness over there? though exmoor's pretty good as well tbh
2018-11-17 19:19:29	~ben	lol there's soooo much

2018-11-17 19:20:12	tildebeast	cool. you could lose a few classes of kids and have room to spare in that terrain :D
2018-11-17 19:20:16	tildebeast	wow
2018-11-17 19:20:20	~ben	yeah seriously
2018-11-17 19:20:41	~ben	i live in the northern part of lower michigan now
2018-11-17 19:20:52	tildebeast	must be delightful in those parts in midwinter :)
2018-11-17 19:21:00	~ben	i wouldn't say that
2018-11-17 19:21:03	tildebeast	heh
2018-11-17 19:21:05	~ben	but i'm just sick of winter :P
2018-11-17 19:21:31	~ben	i've had enough winter and snow for several lifetimes
2018-11-17 19:21:34	tildebeast	i'm not as anti-rain as i used to be, but can't stand freezing cold any more
2018-11-17 19:21:59	tildebeast	over here the snow tends to melt to grey slush, then re-freeze into a dirty ice-rink. lethal.
2018-11-17 19:22:15	~ben	that's almost as gross
2018-11-17 19:22:28	~ben	but shoveling your car out of the driveway is a royal PITA
2018-11-17 19:22:31	tildebeast	and the council only grits the main streets and half the residents are too clueless to do their own immediate patch.
2018-11-17 19:22:34	tildebeast	yup
2018-11-17 19:23:06	tildebeast	i always fancy a winter somewhere cold. but preferably in a cabin with about 6 months of tinned/dry food and a few cords of dry wood :)
2018-11-17 19:23:15	tildebeast	and absolutely no need to go anywhere
2018-11-17 19:23:40	tildebeast	couldn't be having with a commute or whatever in those conditions
2018-11-17 19:24:11	~ben	^^ exactly
2018-11-17 19:24:23	~ben	the roads are usually pretty well-plowed 
2018-11-17 19:24:26	~ben	and salted, etc
2018-11-17 19:24:40	~ben	but it's still no fun to drive in the winter
2018-11-17 19:24:50	tildebeast	yup.
2018-11-17 19:25:09	tildebeast	i see it's just the happy side of freezing over there right now...
2018-11-17 19:25:10	~ben	too many long drives in blizzards
2018-11-17 19:25:12	~ben	lol
2018-11-17 19:25:14	tildebeast	ugh
2018-11-17 19:25:44	~ben	white-knuckle drives
2018-11-17 19:25:46	~ben	lol
2018-11-17 19:25:49	tildebeast	had that on the motorways (freeways) here too. and there's always some loon who tries to stay at 70mph in a white car with no lights when the rest of us are crawling along in the slow lanes
2018-11-17 19:26:02	~ben	lmao that's probably me
2018-11-17 19:26:04	tildebeast	heh
2018-11-17 19:26:08	~ben	but my car is black
2018-11-17 19:26:14	tildebeast	i always expect to see the debris a mile or so later :)
2018-11-17 19:26:18	~ben	rip
2018-11-17 19:26:25	~ben	i've seen plenty of cars in the ditch
2018-11-17 19:26:33	~ben	and seen them in the process of going into the ditch
2018-11-17 19:26:36	 *	ben knocks on wood
2018-11-17 19:26:41	tildebeast	the current trend seems to be "let's step off the pavement and walk in the road for no good reason"
2018-11-17 19:27:05	~ben	what why
2018-11-17 19:27:47	tildebeast	dunno
2018-11-17 19:28:08	tildebeast	just walking alongside the pavement, but it's bloody stupid. we don't drive slowly around here either
2018-11-17 19:28:21	~ben	yeah that's a Bad Idea
2018-11-17 19:28:50	tildebeast	and people don't realise that a pedestrian in dark clothes doesn't show up at night no matter how many streetlights. 
2018-11-17 19:28:55	tildebeast	anyway
2018-11-17 19:29:05	tildebeast	summoned to dinner...back in a bit.

2018-11-17 20:26:23	+tomasino	you could author new screens and have ownership of them and define links between them. if you created one you controlled it, but could grant write access to others
2018-11-17 20:26:43	+tomasino	and if you wanted, you could link outbound from yours to other people's places

2018-11-17 20:31:39	+jan6	someone actually made their own mush in perl btw (in the last few years), most are made in C and ancient, though
2018-11-17 20:31:52	login	But I can't copy ne1's work like that...
2018-11-17 20:31:57	+jan6	why not?
2018-11-17 20:32:09	+jan6	you can ask for permission if you feel better that way
2018-11-17 20:32:54	login	i'll check what the tilde command is
2018-11-17 20:35:25	+jan6	afaik it's like a unified launcher for stuff

2018-11-17 20:36:32	login	I'll try to fork holodeck over, but i would prefer if it were under ben rather than login
2018-11-17 20:37:19	login	I'll paste a link to tilde.town/~ne1/code.html in the description and in the program itself
2018-11-17 20:37:42	fosslinux	ben: if i compiled source code, could i submit that?
2018-11-17 20:38:00	~ben	it just has to be something under ~/bin
2018-11-17 20:38:05	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-17 20:38:14	fosslinux	nice
2018-11-17 20:38:15	~ben	an executable in there 
2018-11-17 20:38:22	fosslinux	i've got lots of stuff under bin i think
2018-11-17 20:38:28	~ben	then I'll get an email and I can approve it
2018-11-17 20:38:40	~ben	and then it will be symlinked into /tilde/bin

2018-11-17 20:39:58	+jan6	just put it on tildegit and won't matter much
2018-11-17 20:43:19	fosslinux	ben: i submitted dos2unix, unix2dos and rclone (built binaries from source code)
2018-11-17 20:44:57	+jan6	those are packages too ?

2018-11-17 21:32:15	tildebeast	in ~/.config/twtxt/config , under the [twtxt] heading , add ...
2018-11-17 21:32:24	tildebeast	use_abs_time = True

2018-11-17 21:34:05	tildebeast	all of which saves me learning enough about their code to manage a pull request :D

2018-11-17 21:35:33	+jan6	you can also make commandline aliases for that

2018-11-17 21:40:25	dokuja1	The relay works pretty good for android so far
2018-11-17 21:40:28	+jan6	basically yeah
2018-11-17 21:40:33	dokuja1	Haha
2018-11-17 21:40:49	+jan6	no idea about relay, I use team's thelouge :3

2018-11-17 21:41:32	dokuja1	Ah
2018-11-17 21:41:36	tildebeast	that's a useful setup guide ben. ta.
2018-11-17 21:41:41	~ben	:)
2018-11-17 21:41:50	~ben	feel free to nab anything else from the stuff in my dotfiles
2018-11-17 21:41:54	dokuja1	Will test battery life vs mosh session.
2018-11-17 21:41:59	tildebeast	will do, thanks
2018-11-17 21:42:11	tildebeast	just how persistent is mosh, by the way?
2018-11-17 21:42:16	 *	dokuja1 reads the guide too
2018-11-17 21:42:43	~ben	tildebeast: quite
2018-11-17 21:43:02	tildebeast	might be worth a try then
2018-11-17 21:43:04	~ben	i've left a mosh up on my laptop, put it to sleep, come back three or four days later and it's still running
2018-11-17 21:43:04	dokuja1	Surprisingly persistent
2018-11-17 21:43:14	dokuja1	^^^
2018-11-17 21:43:37	tildebeast	does it try to reconnect when the laptop finds itself on another network
2018-11-17 21:43:38	~ben	reconnects as soon as your net connection resumes
2018-11-17 21:43:47	~ben	yeah, the session persists across network changes
2018-11-17 21:43:56	tildebeast	nice
2018-11-17 21:44:12	tildebeast	has to be a mosh server at t'other end?
2018-11-17 21:44:26	~ben	mosh just has to be installed
2018-11-17 21:44:37	~ben	initial connection negotiation is over ssh
2018-11-17 21:45:03	~ben	then it spins up a user process (mosh-server) that communicates with your stuff in the 60000-61000 range of ports
2018-11-17 21:45:05	tildebeast	damn, my vps is slow :D
2018-11-17 21:45:20	~ben	rips
2018-11-17 21:46:08	tildebeast	i mean, i've paid for a whopping 256MB of memory and a bit of a shared core. what's going on?? :D
2018-11-17 21:46:30	~ben	omf that's tiny
2018-11-17 21:46:36	tildebeast	heh
2018-11-17 21:46:45	tildebeast	costs me a lordly £1/month
2018-11-17 21:47:06	+jan6	it's not tiny at all for commandline
2018-11-17 21:47:09	tildebeast	basically just there so i can ssh -D over port 80 at libraries etc
2018-11-17 21:47:12	+jan6	it's just "not big"
2018-11-17 21:47:27	+jan6	not a bad idea
2018-11-17 21:47:28	~ben	if you'd be ok with 2.49 eur/month you can get 2gb ram, 20gb disk from hetzner
2018-11-17 21:47:30	~ben	https://www.hetzner.com/cloud
2018-11-17 21:47:33	TildeBot	Truly thrifty cloud hosting - Hetzner Online GmbH 
2018-11-17 21:47:33	tildebeast	not really any worse than my pi zero. mind you, that's really teeny
2018-11-17 21:47:46	tildebeast	might be worth giving them a try sometime
2018-11-17 21:47:57	~ben	~team has ssh on 80 and 443 if you like
2018-11-17 21:48:12	~ben	and it's in germany so you probably get decent ping
2018-11-17 21:48:27	tildebeast	ah. would help if i opened a port on my vps :D
2018-11-17 21:48:42	+jan6	I use team as a proxy for minecraft @ school net ;P
2018-11-17 21:48:54	~ben	80 and 443 is only on the secondary ip 
2018-11-17 21:48:59	~ben	(ssh.tilde.team)
2018-11-17 21:49:20	tildebeast	so ssh -D 12345 -p 80 ssh.tilde.team ?
2018-11-17 21:49:34	-->	asm (asm@tilde.team) has joined #meta
2018-11-17 21:49:51	+jan6	probably not the best place to proxy streaming serices through, but fine for everything else
2018-11-17 21:50:03	+jan6	I'd setup an ssh alias
2018-11-17 21:50:08	+jan6	but I think so
2018-11-17 21:50:26	tildebeast	only for wikipediaing etc at the library. wouldn't dream of running heavy traffic through someone else's server
2018-11-17 21:50:40	+jan6	also I'd personally use the ssh.tilde.team:80 instead of -p 80 but that's personal preference
2018-11-17 21:50:55	tildebeast	sure, understood
2018-11-17 21:51:00	+jan6	as I said, would setup alias anyway
2018-11-17 21:51:10	tildebeast	yes
2018-11-17 21:51:18	+jan6	also you could just make that your main connection anyway
2018-11-17 21:52:09	~ben	tildebeast: yeah 
2018-11-17 21:52:22	~ben	jan6: that shouldn't work
2018-11-17 21:52:27	tildebeast	i've got a dandy connection at home but in 'forrin parts' such as libraries and cafes it's nice to bypass some of the insecurity
2018-11-17 21:52:33	<--	asm (asm@tilde.team) has quit (quit: WeeChat 2.3)
2018-11-17 21:52:45	~ben	~team has unlimited bandwidth
2018-11-17 21:52:56	~ben	it's only used about 550 gb ytd
2018-11-17 21:53:20	~ben	used to be 30tb outgoing/ulimited incoming but they removed that
2018-11-17 21:53:58	login	~team has unlimited bandwith means 1000 TB bandwidth is also okay?
2018-11-17 21:54:10	login	ytd -> yesterday?
2018-11-17 21:54:29	tildebeast	is the host called ssh.tilde.team?
2018-11-17 21:54:40	~ben	tildebeast: yeah, that resolves to the secondary ip
2018-11-17 21:54:47	~ben	login: ytd = year to date
2018-11-17 21:55:09	~ben	login: not sure, wasn't planning on testing that
2018-11-17 21:55:27	tildebeast	odd, getting 'no route to host' although if i ping it by name i've got an ip for it. 
2018-11-17 21:55:32	 *	tildebeast scratches head
2018-11-17 21:56:20	~ben	dig a ssh.tilde.team
2018-11-17 21:56:26	~ben	should get 195.201.242.2
2018-11-17 21:56:48	login	so ssh.tilde.team resolves to secondary ip, but the secondary ip points to this same server (i don't mean irc, but the whole server)?

2018-11-17 21:57:20	login	so dns works, but the ip address doesn't belong to any server...
2018-11-17 21:57:23	+jan6	secondary ssh server, yes, in theory at least
2018-11-17 21:57:25	~ben	yes
2018-11-17 21:57:40	~ben	they both point to the same box
2018-11-17 21:57:43	tildebeast	hmm
2018-11-17 21:57:44	+jan6	^that
2018-11-17 21:57:54	login	can one box have two ip addresses?
2018-11-17 21:57:59	+jan6	sure, why not?
2018-11-17 21:58:02	~ben	yah why not
2018-11-17 21:58:06	tildebeast	routers do
2018-11-17 21:58:07	~ben	you can have whole subnets 
2018-11-17 21:58:08	login	i mean, i think there isn't anything in any protocol that prohibits it...
2018-11-17 21:58:10	+jan6	you could have 500 if you really wanted
2018-11-17 21:58:21	-->	asm (asm@tilde.team) has joined #meta

2018-11-17 21:58:33	~ben	hi
2018-11-17 21:58:34	tildebeast	hey asm
2018-11-17 21:58:41	fosslinux	dns rootservers have whole /8s??!!!
2018-11-17 21:58:44	fosslinux	hi asm
2018-11-17 21:58:48	+jan6	hoi
2018-11-17 21:58:50	login	So any /8 ip address would point to the dns rootserver?
2018-11-17 21:59:01	~ben	wait maybe i'm mistaken on that
2018-11-17 21:59:11	~ben	but 1 ip = 1 machine is not true
2018-11-17 21:59:14	login	Meaning, 100.xxx.xxx.xx would point to one dns rootserver?
2018-11-17 21:59:37	fosslinux	that's what ben means
2018-11-17 21:59:39	login	1 ip = 1 machine is not true, i know, but i thought usually 1 router with 1 ip address is shared by multiple people connected to said router...
2018-11-17 21:59:48	login	I know that kind of ip address sharing, so to speak
2018-11-17 21:59:50	fosslinux	yes login, thats called nat
2018-11-17 22:00:00	login	But one server having multiple ip addresses is new to me
2018-11-17 22:00:26	+jan6	NAT is only a thing cause ipv4 got too small

2018-11-18 01:01:06	fosslinux	really tomasino
2018-11-18 01:01:08	~ben	yeap
2018-11-18 01:01:11	fosslinux	i didn't know that
2018-11-18 01:01:29	~ben	makes the other person more comfortable around you
2018-11-18 01:01:46	mushmouth	yeah i try not to mirror the other person
2018-11-18 01:02:08	+tomasino	you can use the opposite technique as well. If a person has very closed body language you can demonstrate your openness and it can help the other person to loosen up
2018-11-18 01:02:18	~ben	that too
2018-11-18 01:02:20	~ben	depends on the situation
2018-11-18 01:03:13	+tomasino	basics logic is mirror unless the other person is drifting into a mentality that isn't conducive to your cause. In that case, act the way you want them too. If you've been mirroring them up until that point, often they'll unconsciously mirror you back
2018-11-18 01:04:05	+tomasino	mushmouth: next time, don't fear mirroring
2018-11-18 01:04:12	+tomasino	most of the time people don't notice it at all
2018-11-18 01:04:20	~ben	very true
2018-11-18 01:04:51	mushmouth	it just always on my mind when im with people tomasino

2018-11-18 01:05:55	mushmouth	like for the longest time i hated certain x. because it was the "popular" thing to do
2018-11-18 01:06:07	mushmouth	or use
2018-11-18 01:06:15	~ben	popular != bad
2018-11-18 01:06:23	~ben	it can, but not necessarily

2018-11-18 03:54:37	~ben	definitely not a classical ac game
2018-11-18 03:54:42	~ben	which i really enjoy
2018-11-18 03:55:04	ahriman	i got tired of the ac franchise after a while but i want to pick it back up again
2018-11-18 03:55:30	~ben	yeah i had gotten bored of it around/after ac 3
2018-11-18 03:55:35	~ben	loved ac 2 though
2018-11-18 03:55:39	ahriman	SAME
2018-11-18 03:55:50	~ben	origins and odyssey are 5/7
2018-11-18 03:55:50	ahriman	ac 2 was where it's at, but ac3/4 was meh

2018-11-18 04:01:20	~ben	what prompted the question?
2018-11-18 04:01:27	mushmouth	just something i thought about
2018-11-18 04:01:37	~ben	depends on the person and what happened i guess
2018-11-18 04:01:54	mushmouth	cause my reaction is to just hide and move away
2018-11-18 04:02:00	mushmouth	like do something else
2018-11-18 04:02:22	npa	yeah depends what kind of cringe
2018-11-18 04:02:32	npa	like if i cringe about things i did when i was younger lol
2018-11-18 04:02:41	npa	what am i gonna do other than ignore it?
2018-11-18 04:03:06	mushmouth	i did some stupid things when i was younger
2018-11-18 04:03:21	mushmouth	like really stupid
2018-11-18 04:03:23	mushmouth	in my mind
2018-11-18 04:03:39	npa	i think that's called growing up
2018-11-18 04:03:45	ahriman	mushmouth: we all did that, you just have to tell yourself you were younger and nobody cares anymore, or at least thats how i got over it
2018-11-18 04:07:06	zyeri	nobody cares? nah man, nobody even remembers enough to care
2018-11-18 04:07:16	~ben	lol
2018-11-18 04:07:30	~ben	well one good thing about looking back on your own cringe is seeing how far you've come
2018-11-18 04:07:39	zyeri	true
2018-11-18 04:08:16	zyeri	the fact you cringe in the first place shows you've "grown" since
2018-11-18 04:08:27	zyeri	or changed, at the very least

2018-11-18 06:17:14	~deepend	i'll see if my friend would be interested in letting me use his HP9000 server for that.. assuming he still has that machine
2018-11-18 06:18:04	~ben	lol i mean it's not a priority
2018-11-18 06:18:30	~deepend	always wanted to try something with one of those lol
2018-11-18 06:19:57	~deepend	either that or his AIX machine

2018-11-18 06:27:37	ahriman	i'd love to play with a solaris machine. i tried to install solaris 11 on a spare tower of mine but it didn't like my hardware
2018-11-18 06:28:25	~deepend	not overly.. is a not ancient version of IBM AIX running on a IBM power system.. 
2018-11-18 06:29:06	~deepend	i used to have a few sun servers and had solaris installed on one of them.. but it was sooooo slow.. so gave up and got rid of it.. not patient enough for those machines
2018-11-18 06:39:09	ahriman	one day ill save up for a Talos II / IBM power9 workstation

2018-11-18 17:00:12	login	I love giteabot. whoever created it did a wonderful job
2018-11-18 17:00:35	login	I would just like to say that the words '5 commits' in the above message were colorised black to me.
2018-11-18 17:00:54	login	I don't know whether that's a feature of my own weechat config or whether it can be influenced on the other side...
2018-11-18 17:01:10	login	but black text on black background is nigh unreadable without selecting
2018-11-18 17:04:09	epicmorphism	login: town. i dont have a ~.team account
2018-11-18 17:05:14	erxeto	it's grey for me login 
2018-11-18 17:06:19	login	erxeto: so it might be my color scheme...
2018-11-18 17:06:33	login	Perhaps I should set foreground black to a greyish color...
2018-11-18 17:06:43	login	epicmorphism: no problem epicmorphism... i was just wondering...
2018-11-18 17:07:16	epicmorphism	yeah no worries
2018-11-18 17:07:44	login	erxeto: it worked! that was pretty smple...
2018-11-18 17:07:56	login	But now everything that's supposed to be black is greyer...
2018-11-18 17:08:17	login	(and depending on the background, it's less readable now...)
2018-11-18 17:08:20	login	So double-edged sword

2018-11-18 17:10:20	erxeto	my background is black (on urxvt terminal emulator)
2018-11-18 17:11:07	login	I wonder why there is an "enter" symbol under my name, and how giteabot also seems to highlight in my message...
2018-11-18 17:11:29	login	But other than those, could you tell me how weechat looks for you?
2018-11-18 17:11:37	login	That was where the black colors started having an effect
2018-11-18 17:11:50	epicmorphism	is that ubuntu mono?

2018-11-18 17:21:53	erxeto	login: the enter is the continuation character I have defined on weechat config
2018-11-18 17:22:16	erxeto	can't remember the setup variable now.
2018-11-18 17:22:37	erxeto	login: do you want a screenshot of this conversation ?
2018-11-18 18:12:08	login	i just want to know if black looks grey for you on, say, weechat's green bar at the bottom
2018-11-18 18:12:20	login	and how the ubuntu mono theme deals with that

2018-11-19 02:10:17	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 02:10:17	slipyx	id pick team just for the cool domain name options
2018-11-19 02:10:32	~ben	yeah that's one good poing
2018-11-19 02:10:44	~ben	none of them have the storage you're looking for amcclure 
2018-11-19 02:11:02	~deepend	your~ for sure.

2018-11-19 02:11:20	~deepend	I may be a bit bias tho :P 
2018-11-19 02:11:28	~ben	i always recommend using the one with the best ping (for weechat at least)
2018-11-19 02:12:08	~ben	which is generally going to be your~ for the us
2018-11-19 02:12:11	~ben	and ~team for europe
2018-11-19 02:12:18	~ben	just based on server location
2018-11-19 02:12:22	~ben	but mosh negates some of that
2018-11-19 02:12:42	~ben	if you want cool domains, ~team has tons
2018-11-19 02:12:47	~ben	your~ has a handful
2018-11-19 02:12:54	~ben	~town only has one
2018-11-19 02:12:57	~ben	and no php
2018-11-19 02:13:06	~ben	which discounts a lot for me lol
2018-11-19 02:13:09	~deepend	I support most of anything.  I'm prety flexible
2018-11-19 02:13:47	~ben	town is extra anti-php 
2018-11-19 02:13:49	~ben	not sure why
2018-11-19 02:14:03	~ben	i guess they don'e have the hardware for it
2018-11-19 02:14:17	~deepend	town would be screwed if they enabled php lol
2018-11-19 02:14:23	amcclure	why
2018-11-19 02:14:26	amcclure	lol

2018-11-19 02:14:56	~deepend	very lacking resources :P
2018-11-19 02:15:17	~ben	2 core, 4gb ram iirc
2018-11-19 02:15:21	~deepend	team and town definately have more resources.. not sure why vil stays on aws
2018-11-19 02:15:33	npa	uptime I remember him saying
2018-11-19 02:15:44	amcclure	why is aws so expensive though
2018-11-19 02:15:50	npa	was thinking of switching to DO, starting with the game servers
2018-11-19 02:16:05	~deepend	uptime is only as good as the admin makes it.. probably crashes more on aws because of running out of resources then he ever would on a dedi
2018-11-19 02:16:12	npa	they have lightsail or something now, VPSes now
2018-11-19 02:16:13	~ben	DO is still a bit expensive for my tastes

2018-11-19 02:16:24	amcclure	average pings
2018-11-19 02:16:52	npa	yeah, hetzner would be cool to use for ~town, but idk there might be downsides (its located in europe for one)?

2018-11-19 02:17:31	amcclure	~team 143ms / ~town 89ms / your~ 53ms

2018-11-19 02:20:56	amcclure	back when university was offering web hosting they only allowed static pages

2018-11-19 02:22:51	~ben	probably should
2018-11-19 02:22:53	~ben	much better ping
2018-11-19 02:23:22	~deepend	sorry not being very helpful :)  town is probably the one that makes the least sense. not because of features.. just because of resources mostly
2018-11-19 02:23:45	~ben	yep ^^
2018-11-19 02:24:00	~ben	plus you get a few bonus domains to choose from with ~team or your~
2018-11-19 02:24:12	amcclure	what are the extras for either
2018-11-19 02:24:13	~deepend	so really outside of that it comes down to how quick you want your pages to respond when you try to go to them :)

2018-11-19 02:28:03	+tomasino	jeez, guys
2018-11-19 02:28:03	amcclure	the reason my home dir's so large is
2018-11-19 02:28:15	amcclure	a backup of my important thunix data
2018-11-19 02:28:15	+tomasino	i'm fretting about 80mb per CYOA show archive
2018-11-19 02:28:21	~ben	ahhh ok :P

2018-11-19 02:28:40	~ben	tomasino: that's negligible
2018-11-19 02:28:57	~ben	i'm not actually worried until we get below 15gb free on /
2018-11-19 02:29:04	amcclure	cuz from about 7-8am my timezone till now I thought the data was lost for good
2018-11-19 02:29:10	~ben	ooof

2018-11-19 02:29:29	npa	yeah I'm thinking of putting my data on the uni servers or the research network just to backup
2018-11-19 02:29:30	fosslinux	that's a bit
2018-11-19 02:29:32	fosslinux	sad
2018-11-19 02:29:33	+tomasino	deepend: requested!

2018-11-19 02:29:46	~ben	yeah, it's always a good idea to have backups
2018-11-19 02:29:52	~ben	~team backs up hourly to tarsnap
2018-11-19 02:29:56	~deepend	tomasino: will get that setup for you. 1 moment :D 
2018-11-19 02:29:56	+tomasino	backups are for wimps!

2018-11-19 02:30:52	~ben	depends how much you're willing to keep
2018-11-19 02:31:06	fosslinux	on windows i do 6hourly backups that i keep all of
2018-11-19 02:31:09	fosslinux	only ~150GB
2018-11-19 02:31:15	fosslinux	on linux i do hourly
2018-11-19 02:31:19	fosslinux	~100GB
2018-11-19 02:31:32	+tomasino	i keep most of my content in git, hosted in multiple remotes. I keep my system config in my dotfiles and as i install new things, i keep a running script to help me auto-recreate my env. 
2018-11-19 02:31:48	~ben	only keep 1 day's worth of hourlies, 7 day's worth of dailies etc
2018-11-19 02:31:48	fosslinux	really nice
2018-11-19 02:31:55	+tomasino	media stuff i keep on multiple externals & cloud storage
2018-11-19 02:32:00	~ben	tomasino: i do that for my personal stuff too
2018-11-19 02:32:03	~deepend	hourly would be great.. lol  but right now the server isn't busy enough to justify it
2018-11-19 02:32:07	+tomasino	and my pi's I image full disk monthly
2018-11-19 02:32:18	~ben	i definitely copied your stow+make setup tomasino

2018-11-19 02:35:05	fosslinux	oh lol
2018-11-19 02:35:13	amcclure	oof
2018-11-19 02:35:14	+tomasino	you could use a bash script instead of make if you're into that
2018-11-19 02:35:19	+tomasino	but i like make. 
2018-11-19 02:35:28	~ben	make is far nicer to use
2018-11-19 02:35:33	fosslinux	i don't know make :(
2018-11-19 02:35:39	~ben	it's not hard
2018-11-19 02:35:49	amcclure	~team or your~ - got anything that'll convince me to use your service for my site?
2018-11-19 02:36:02	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 02:36:06	~ben	i mean
2018-11-19 02:36:09	fosslinux	your~: it's centos GHAU%THAI%NGIANJFDNKBSNFIFASNDF
2018-11-19 02:36:09	amcclure	once I start setting the site up there's a very little chance that I'll move it
2018-11-19 02:36:13	fosslinux	use ~team
2018-11-19 02:36:18	~deepend	lol
2018-11-19 02:36:21	~ben	team is ubuntu
2018-11-19 02:36:25	~ben	your is centos
2018-11-19 02:36:32	~ben	there's really no bad choice
2018-11-19 02:36:56	+tomasino	oh, centos, eh?
2018-11-19 02:36:58	+tomasino	interesting
2018-11-19 02:37:01	+tomasino	is stow installed?

2018-11-19 02:37:44	amcclure	how many security updates are waiting on your~ then lol
2018-11-19 02:38:04	amcclure	I don't think centos says when it needs to be restarted
2018-11-19 02:39:03	~ben	good question
2018-11-19 02:39:05	~deepend	lol  for the kernel?  none that are available. lol   
2018-11-19 02:39:05	~ben	deepend: ^?
2018-11-19 02:39:14	amcclure	tbh I won't really be able to make a decision till I see which one connects better from university wifi and ethernet
2018-11-19 02:39:27	~ben	~team has ssh on 80 and 443 if you need it
2018-11-19 02:39:29	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 02:39:48	amcclure	oh
2018-11-19 02:39:57	amcclure	they don't block ssh
2018-11-19 02:40:01	~ben	for when 22 is blcoked
2018-11-19 02:40:09	~ben	then it should be the same
2018-11-19 02:40:16	amcclure	o
2018-11-19 02:40:25	~ben	other than the ping difference
2018-11-19 02:40:39	~deepend	interesting feature ben.. good on ya :D   GUess I need to throw a few more ips at the problem :P lol
2018-11-19 02:40:44	~ben	lmao
2018-11-19 02:40:49	~ben	i only threw one extra at it
2018-11-19 02:40:59	amcclure	hmm
2018-11-19 02:41:01	~ben	it's like $1/mo :/
2018-11-19 02:41:06	~deepend	should I do an ip per service? LMAO jk
2018-11-19 02:41:12	~ben	lol nooooo
2018-11-19 02:42:10	amcclure	I was able to connect to a univ linux machine and tried

2018-11-19 02:42:58	~ben	omf i do
2018-11-19 02:43:11	amcclure	got a better ping with your
2018-11-19 02:43:22	amcclure	I'm guessing distance has a lot to do with it
2018-11-19 02:43:48	~deepend	probably.  your is in a good location for canada and the US. 
2018-11-19 02:44:32	~deepend	i get 56 ping to your and I'm on the oposite side of canada then the server
2018-11-19 02:44:42	~ben	yeah distance is a huge factor
2018-11-19 02:45:07	~ben	i think the best ping i get is with to1.hashbang.sh
2018-11-19 02:45:32	~ben	yeah 33ms
2018-11-19 02:45:35	~deepend	66ms to that address from here
2018-11-19 02:45:48	~ben	do you get better ping to sf1.hashbang.sh then? deepend 
2018-11-19 02:46:06	~ben	they're probably both about the same tbh
2018-11-19 02:46:09	~deepend	56
2018-11-19 02:46:20	~deepend	so a bit better
2018-11-19 02:46:23	~ben	heh
2018-11-19 02:46:26	~ben	interesting
2018-11-19 02:46:32	~ben	very location based then
2018-11-19 02:46:50	~ben	sf1 is 90ms for me
2018-11-19 02:47:07	~deepend	I think you have a ipv6 address of archive going to your server.. lol  
2018-11-19 02:47:08	~ben	ny1.hashbang.sh is 50ms
2018-11-19 02:47:16	~ben	hm?
2018-11-19 02:47:43	~deepend	because it pings archive.tildeverse.org to a ipv6 address with 150ms ping lol
2018-11-19 02:47:55	~deepend	oh nm.. wrong domain
2018-11-19 02:48:11	~deepend	I'm loosing it.
2018-11-19 02:48:30	~deepend	<1ms to archive.. not bad.. LMAO :D  
2018-11-19 02:48:41	~ben	archive.tilderadio.org is 95ms for me

2018-11-19 02:55:21	~deepend	maybe centos doesn't push git updates very often?  centos is very much known for being behind the curve on stuf.. except for security updates
2018-11-19 02:55:31	~ben	2.11 is in stretch
2018-11-19 02:55:54	~deepend	1 moment :D 
2018-11-19 02:56:34	+tomasino	;)
2018-11-19 02:56:41	~ben	deepend: don't forget to install stow
2018-11-19 02:56:49	+tomasino	once that's in place i just need to turn on the cron, and gopher black will have another mirror running
2018-11-19 02:57:01	+tomasino	the content is already up: gopher://yourtilde.com/1/~tomasino/
2018-11-19 02:57:10	~ben	uwu nice
2018-11-19 02:57:50	+tomasino	i realized that my gopher repo was private for some stupid reason

2018-11-19 02:58:08	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 02:58:32	+tomasino	it was private and bitbucket is free for private
2018-11-19 02:58:37	+tomasino	why was it private? great question
2018-11-19 02:59:01	~ben	lmao
2018-11-19 02:59:03	~ben	ok

2018-11-19 02:59:54	+tomasino	oh, i can't crontab on yourtilde
2018-11-19 03:00:08	+tomasino	that could be problematic for my auto updating
2018-11-19 03:00:13	~ben	ruh roh
2018-11-19 03:00:16	+tomasino	does centos do something different?
2018-11-19 03:00:24	+tomasino	not just crontab -e?
2018-11-19 03:00:32	~ben	not that i know of
2018-11-19 03:00:39	+tomasino	huh, sadface
2018-11-19 03:00:47	~ben	You (ben) are not allowed to use this program (crontab)
2018-11-19 03:00:56	+tomasino	now i have to make town do it for me and rsync all the files
2018-11-19 03:00:59	+tomasino	;)

2018-11-19 03:01:15	+tomasino	that would be dumb
2018-11-19 03:01:41	+tomasino	it's the only other place that matches the file structure enough to use the same file config. 
2018-11-19 03:01:47	~ben	ohh
2018-11-19 03:01:48	+tomasino	deepend: is the no cron thing intentional?
2018-11-19 03:02:15	+tomasino	i'd do it off team, but team is a different gopher
2018-11-19 03:02:32	~ben	yourtilde isn't gophernicus?
2018-11-19 03:02:45	~deepend	oh shit.. I will enable it.. is one thing the auto add script doesn't do currently
2018-11-19 03:03:22	amcclure	I don't really need crontabs for anything
2018-11-19 03:03:24	~deepend	cron should work for you now
2018-11-19 03:03:36	+tomasino	thanks!
2018-11-19 03:03:39	~deepend	np
2018-11-19 03:03:46	amcclure	can I have them enabled pls
2018-11-19 03:03:53	~deepend	my bad.. will work on getting that as part of my script.. 
2018-11-19 03:04:06	~deepend	amcclure: enabled
2018-11-19 03:04:21	+tomasino	:D
2018-11-19 03:04:40	~ben	deepend: what do you use to {en,dis}able it per-user?
2018-11-19 03:04:51	amcclure	since thunix is shutdown forever now
2018-11-19 03:05:21	~ben	rips
2018-11-19 03:05:37	amcclure	I had to go through a .txt file and notify organizations we were hoting mirrors for that the server was permanently gone
2018-11-19 03:05:39	+tomasino	sadface explosion
2018-11-19 03:05:52	+tomasino	okay, once yourtilde has git > 2.0, my gopher hole is good to go on there
2018-11-19 03:05:57	amcclure	I got this from the GNU webmaster team:
2018-11-19 03:05:57	+tomasino	and i can start looking into other fun things
2018-11-19 03:06:00	amcclure	"I'm sorry to hear that. It must be inconvenient for you, too!"
2018-11-19 03:06:20	~ben	uuf
2018-11-19 03:07:02	slipyx	probably wouldof lasted longer if it wasnt self-hosted
2018-11-19 03:07:07	amcclure	probably
2018-11-19 03:07:09	slipyx	and.. not had a gpu
2018-11-19 03:07:11	~ben	s/of/'ve/
2018-11-19 03:07:27	+tomasino	deepend: something else to check out... i can't delete the cgi-bin dir in public_html. It looks like it's owned by me, but if i cd in i can't even ls
2018-11-19 03:07:49	slipyx	only two reasons you put a gpu in a server
2018-11-19 03:07:52	amcclure	I'm guessing ~team would be best for the site
2018-11-19 03:07:53	+tomasino	oh, just really weird permissions by default
2018-11-19 03:07:59	slipyx	and not everyone are 3D graphic designers
2018-11-19 03:08:05	slipyx	but everyone loves free money
2018-11-19 03:08:19	~ben	slipyx: only two reasons for a server gpu are bitcoin and ethereum
2018-11-19 03:08:26	amcclure	I'm planning on changing the licensing to Creative Commons
2018-11-19 03:08:45	~deepend	k tomasino 
2018-11-19 03:09:42	amcclure	Around Summer I talked to Hexhaxtron once and he said he didn't plan on using the machine as a server at first
2018-11-19 03:09:54	~deepend	oh.. so you got it i see tomasino 
2018-11-19 03:09:57	~ben	lmao
2018-11-19 03:10:04	~ben	then that's why he stopped
2018-11-19 03:10:08	~ben	hosting from home sux
2018-11-19 03:10:32	amcclure	there were also some beginning signs of disk/hardware failure and prices were going up
2018-11-19 03:10:49	~ben	boom
2018-11-19 03:10:53	amcclure	there were ways to donate but must users didn't
2018-11-19 03:11:04	~ben	yup
2018-11-19 03:11:04	+tomasino	yep yeps
2018-11-19 03:11:13	+tomasino	might be something in the skel, though
2018-11-19 03:11:31	~ben	skel of thunix?
2018-11-19 03:11:35	~ben	oh your!
2018-11-19 03:11:38	+tomasino	no, responding to deepend 
2018-11-19 03:11:44	amcclure	so my guess is hardware problems, got too expensive to run, or
2018-11-19 03:11:54	~ben	or both
2018-11-19 03:12:05	amcclure	thunix had a proxy, as a result his IP got blocked by a lot of services
2018-11-19 03:12:07	+tomasino	i like tildes. they're cute
2018-11-19 03:12:13	~ben	proxy for what?
2018-11-19 03:12:18	~ben	just general internet traffic?
2018-11-19 03:12:19	+tomasino	proxy service?
2018-11-19 03:12:22	+tomasino	huh
2018-11-19 03:12:23	~ben	that's a Bad Idea
2018-11-19 03:12:35	~deepend	well lets see if I can break git. 1 moment :P
2018-11-19 03:13:10	amcclure	It was later changed to more if a tunnel than a general proxy later on
2018-11-19 03:13:35	~deepend	yeah. the permissions on the cgi-bin probably could be refined.. or just get rid of cgi-bin.. i just like having cgi/perlscripts as a option :P 
2018-11-19 03:13:47	+tomasino	it's a nice thing to have
2018-11-19 03:14:07	amcclure	but it was basically if any users did anything wrong they blocked the server ip, which was the home ip
2018-11-19 03:14:18	+tomasino	user should probably be a 7 though
2018-11-19 03:14:28	+tomasino	owner, rather
2018-11-19 03:14:30	+tomasino	moops
2018-11-19 03:14:35	amcclure	it kind of sounds like it would've been causing problems :(
2018-11-19 03:14:49	~deepend	well git is updated.. but broke my gitweb implimentation.. doh lol
2018-11-19 03:14:57	+tomasino	hah

2018-11-19 03:15:25	~deepend	gitweb is a web based access to a users git repo.  like a scaled down gitea sorta.. lol
2018-11-19 03:15:29	~deepend	hi hyperboredoubt 
2018-11-19 03:15:42	~ben	it's basically just a read-only view of the repo

2018-11-19 03:16:17	~deepend	yeah.. but not the end of the world.. will fix it later.. not like 99% of users use it anyways lol

2018-11-19 03:19:45	hyperboredoubt	1. What programming languages does this thing support?
2018-11-19 03:20:04	~ben	which thing?
2018-11-19 03:20:24	hyperboredoubt	Yourtilde and/or TildeTeam.
2018-11-19 03:20:36	~ben	most languages that you would like to use

2018-11-19 03:20:50	hyperboredoubt	Is Python good to use?
2018-11-19 03:21:07	~ben	yeah it's pretty easy to learn
2018-11-19 03:21:09	~deepend	lookup advancedcs.ca  Its one of my domains.. been hosting websites/running servers predating that domain.  yourtilde is new ish.. but i have a decent track record :P 
2018-11-19 03:21:40	hyperboredoubt	I'll check it now.

2018-11-19 03:26:42	~deepend	probably higher chance of me getting geocities.com lol  even though people have tried back in the day .. but yahoo seems stuck on keeping it lol
2018-11-19 03:27:01	amcclure	I never got to figure out one very important question regarding thunix
2018-11-19 03:27:16	amcclure	something I wanted to know from when I signed up
2018-11-19 03:28:23	amcclure	is it pronounced like t-h-unix or is the "th" þ
2018-11-19 03:28:34	+tomasino	þ is my vote!
2018-11-19 03:29:00	+tomasino	the bigger question is the u
2018-11-19 03:29:11	+tomasino	is it like thumb or thoonix?
2018-11-19 03:29:23	+tomasino	thewnix
2018-11-19 03:29:30	amcclure	however you pronounce unix
2018-11-19 03:29:35	hyperboredoubt	2. How difficult would it be to make a poetry generator? First and foremost, I'd like to be able to tweak how many syllables per line and stanza. Secondly, it won't be in English but rather an invented language, so vocabulary is easier to produce.
2018-11-19 03:29:40	+tomasino	th-ewe-nix
2018-11-19 03:30:01	+tomasino	invented language makes it easy since you can cheat
2018-11-19 03:30:11	+tomasino	but what constitutes poetry in your conlang?
2018-11-19 03:30:25	+tomasino	is it meter? is it rhyme? is there any reliance on the content?
2018-11-19 03:30:42	+tomasino	are we just mashing random words together or does it need to convey some sort of meaning?
2018-11-19 03:30:47	hyperboredoubt	I don't use that term, but as of yet we only have a couple original poems (mostly self-deprecating).
2018-11-19 03:31:31	+tomasino	do you write them in english and then translate the words?
2018-11-19 03:31:38	+tomasino	do you create new vocabulary as you write?
2018-11-19 03:31:52	hyperboredoubt	Mostly meter, since rhyme is avoided. But, yes, mashing random (but grammatical!) words together will suffice as a proof of concept.
2018-11-19 03:32:11	~deepend	thunix is gone?   guessing thats why you were wondering about randomly disapearing servers? :D 
2018-11-19 03:32:19	hyperboredoubt	Yes to both.
2018-11-19 03:32:30	+tomasino	you have a few options then. the best results would be to markov chain that bad-boy and feed it LOTS of examples
2018-11-19 03:32:51	+tomasino	but you could build some super restrictive things manually as well
2018-11-19 03:33:07	+tomasino	focus on something really fixed, like a version of haiku
2018-11-19 03:33:08	hyperboredoubt	No markov chains please.
2018-11-19 03:33:08	TildeBot	no u infinity hyperboredoubt
2018-11-19 03:33:21	hyperboredoubt	Shush, TildeBot.
2018-11-19 03:33:22	TildeBot	hyperboredoubt: Is the most #chaos.
2018-11-19 03:33:46	+tomasino	are you trying to make a lot of poems for a reason?
2018-11-19 03:34:00	+tomasino	you'll probably spend more effort making a program than just writing the poetry yourself
2018-11-19 03:34:28	hyperboredoubt	Well, I *am* working on a long form (human-written) poem, but I'd like to see what we can do with procedural generation.
2018-11-19 03:35:03	~deepend	well thats unfortunate
2018-11-19 03:35:03	+tomasino	good luck! sounds like a fun project
2018-11-19 03:35:42	~deepend	regarding thunix not your comment hyperboredoubt  :D
2018-11-19 03:36:44	hyperboredoubt	Basically, I want to be able to define and delimit syllable and word boundaries then be able to receive a poem of a chosen meter and length.
2018-11-19 03:37:42	~deepend	like the gopher page tomasino  :D
2018-11-19 03:38:53	~deepend	ohh,, 1 year coming up very soon for yourtilde :D 
2018-11-19 03:39:12	+tomasino	very nice!
2018-11-19 03:39:26	+tomasino	I should have phlogged "new to me"
2018-11-19 03:39:52	hyperboredoubt	For example, a haiku: 5/7/5. And then it could output something like "Lolo ma numi/Waka bim a tolo/Fi'i bela a!".
2018-11-19 03:41:09	hyperboredoubt	(I copied a mash of Lojban and Toki Pona's phonology above. The actual language (Common Honey) in question has lots more consonants.)

2018-11-19 03:43:54	~deepend	things kinda got quiet all of a sudden.
2018-11-19 03:44:09	hyperboredoubt	I'm still chatty.
2018-11-19 03:44:28	~deepend	for sure. atleast someone is.. I'm never chatty.. I usually just chime in with smart ass comments :P 
2018-11-19 03:45:13	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 03:45:15	~ben	same?
2018-11-19 03:45:22	~ben	guess it depends on the day
2018-11-19 03:45:41	~deepend	I think I've been more chatty today then usual.. but its really hit and miss with me
2018-11-19 03:46:25	hyperboredoubt	How difficult would my project be for someone with no computer experience?
2018-11-19 03:46:26	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 03:46:43	~ben	that's a really good question
2018-11-19 03:46:49	~ben	i don't really know how hard it would be
2018-11-19 03:47:04	hyperboredoubt	And should I work on it throught the tilde community shells?

2018-11-19 03:49:28	hyperboredoubt	One button produces sentences using existing vocabulary. The other produces nonsense that is still phonotactically valid and thus subject to becoming real words in the future, if we so choose.
2018-11-19 03:50:02	~deepend	noice hyperboredoubt :) 
2018-11-19 03:50:11	hyperboredoubt	I say "we" because this is a collaborative project that's been going on for around 3 or 4 years.

2018-11-19 03:59:14	~deepend	still nice
2018-11-19 03:59:45	hyperboredoubt	He's not even part of our group, but he was bored and he has a French accent so I thought it would sound good coming from him.
2018-11-19 04:00:17	~deepend	well it does
2018-11-19 04:01:36	hyperboredoubt	We really had to fudge our translation of "Let It Go" from Frozen.
2018-11-19 04:02:32	~deepend	why
2018-11-19 04:03:51	~ben	sounds very ethereal
2018-11-19 04:04:58	hyperboredoubt	Well, we coined a monosyllabic word meaning "to form a fractal" so we could fit the meter, hahah.
2018-11-19 04:05:09	hyperboredoubt	I think the word was "zim" or something.

2018-11-19 04:08:48	TildeBot	tilde news 
2018-11-19 04:08:51	~ben	s/s$//
2018-11-19 04:08:51	sedbot	<ben> https://tilde.news would probably be the place
2018-11-19 04:08:53	TildeBot	tilde news 
2018-11-19 04:09:01	~deepend	i signed up to use the tilde reddit. but haven't really been on there much since 
2018-11-19 04:09:14	~ben	yeah we have /r/tilde
2018-11-19 04:09:30	~ben	https://tilde.news sees far more traffic
2018-11-19 04:09:32	TildeBot	tilde news 
2018-11-19 04:09:34	~ben	but it's still super low
2018-11-19 04:10:22	~ben	should i open signups for tilde.news again?
2018-11-19 04:10:50	hyperboredoubt	Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
2018-11-19 04:15:42	~deepend	why they disabled? ~team cant handle the server stress from hetzner? :D Lol jk
2018-11-19 04:16:14	~deepend	as this turns into tilde DDOSing wars :P
2018-11-19 04:17:37	hyperboredoubt	Would anyone be interested in joining our ~~cult~~ group?
2018-11-19 04:17:49	slipyx	not another one
2018-11-19 04:18:06	hyperboredoubt	How about a micronation...? :D
2018-11-19 04:19:20	hyperboredoubt	Odd question: What are y'all's basic philosophies/attitudes toward technology? Like, what should we be doing with it and in which direction are you yourselves pushing it?
2018-11-19 04:20:35	~deepend	If anything Im stuck in the past in a lot of ways.
2018-11-19 04:22:26	hyperboredoubt	Yeah, retromania and retrofuturism are huge undercurrents in our culture these days.
2018-11-19 04:23:15	hyperboredoubt	The future ain't what it used to be.
2018-11-19 04:23:29	~deepend	I enjoyed technology a bunch more in the past then I do currently.  but tilde community has really improved things this past year :D 
2018-11-19 04:24:33	hyperboredoubt	I've become rather numbed by the internet. I blame consumerism and such. Things are just too easy but there's no incentive to really care or try.
2018-11-19 04:24:33	~ben	same
2018-11-19 04:24:46	~ben	same re: tildes
2018-11-19 04:25:22	~ben	c{apital,onsumer}ism has ruined the internet for sure
2018-11-19 04:25:30	~deepend	^^
2018-11-19 04:26:11	~deepend	and tildes are to rise up and ruin  c{apital,onsumer}ism....... or could just enjoy life :P lol
2018-11-19 04:26:51	~deepend	back to dialup lets all go! :D  
2018-11-19 04:27:40	hyperboredoubt	https://postbox.garden/
2018-11-19 04:27:41	TildeBot	Welcome to our garden. 
2018-11-19 04:27:59	hyperboredoubt	Check this out. It is an image board where you send in physical mail.
2018-11-19 04:28:32	ahriman	i like how the tildes are generally anticapitalist
2018-11-19 04:28:48	hyperboredoubt	The future of computing will be multi-media. I need some sort of mega-abacus or something, haha.
2018-11-19 04:29:12	~deepend	lol
2018-11-19 04:29:41	hyperboredoubt	I really do think that the screens have something to do with it and not just/only the addictive nature of clickbait and rapid interaction.
2018-11-19 04:30:28	hyperboredoubt	If the internet were like those magical books from Harry Potter, we'd have a different phenomenological experience of it.
2018-11-19 04:30:36	~ben	wihc is ia side effect of capitalism
2018-11-19 04:30:38	~deepend	that imageboard is awesome... when is there going to be a tilde version of it ben ? LOL :D 
2018-11-19 04:30:46	hyperboredoubt	DO IT.
2018-11-19 04:31:15	~ben	i'm down
2018-11-19 04:31:21	~ben	will have to dig out my scanner though
2018-11-19 04:32:00	~deepend	i use a scanner app on my phone.. lol less hardware needed lol
2018-11-19 04:32:14	~ben	i have a feeling that the www would have evolved very differently without the heavy hand of capitalism
2018-11-19 04:33:08	hyperboredoubt	Maybe the address could be "tilde.cards".
2018-11-19 04:33:39	hyperboredoubt	Someone should make a new version of the Glass Bead Game.
2018-11-19 04:33:52	hyperboredoubt	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game
2018-11-19 04:33:53	TildeBot	The Glass Bead Game - Wikipedia https://bhh.sh/1vn
2018-11-19 04:34:59	hyperboredoubt	Hmmm, why is there no tilde.wiki yet?
2018-11-19 04:35:02	~ben	Although the Glass Bead Game is described lucidly, the rules and mechanics are not explained in detail.
2018-11-19 04:35:13	hyperboredoubt	That's the fun. ;)
2018-11-19 04:35:43	hyperboredoubt	Or maybe something like Borges's Lottery of Babylon.
2018-11-19 04:36:45	~ben	not sure what would go on tilde.wiki
2018-11-19 04:36:49	~ben	but there's tilde.team/wiki
2018-11-19 04:36:59	~deepend	and a wiki.yourtilde.com
2018-11-19 04:37:54	~deepend	https://wiki.yourtilde.com  to be specific :) 
2018-11-19 04:41:05	hyperboredoubt	Make a Tilde for all the domains, lol.
2018-11-19 04:41:34	~deepend	or a wiki for all tildes?
2018-11-19 04:41:44	hyperboredoubt	If you like, sure.
2018-11-19 04:44:22	hyperboredoubt	As I mentioned earlier, we need to revisit the idea that a computer is something that does computation/instructions and not just an electronic box.
2018-11-19 04:44:56	~deepend	but but but.. what about my RGB!?  jk :P 
2018-11-19 04:45:21	hyperboredoubt	That is to say, a book, a loom,or maybe even origami can be a computer.
2018-11-19 04:45:23	slipyx	MAGENTA
2018-11-19 04:45:44	hyperboredoubt	Also, why does tilde.net not exist?
2018-11-19 04:45:58	slipyx	tbh, cyan is God's favorite color
2018-11-19 04:48:14	hyperboredoubt	Since I am still extremely new to computerish type things, what should I be checking out? BBS? Forums? Usenet? Gopher? Xanadu? Tor?
2018-11-19 04:48:28	slipyx	irc is all you need
2018-11-19 04:48:32	~ben	^^
2018-11-19 04:48:33	hyperboredoubt	Is it?
2018-11-19 04:48:42	~ben	tomasino is huge in the gopher space
2018-11-19 04:48:44	hyperboredoubt	I still tend to enjoy forums.
2018-11-19 04:48:46	~ben	https://gopher.zone
2018-11-19 04:48:46	TildeBot	 Highway to the Gopher Zone  
2018-11-19 04:48:56	~ben	gopher://gopher.black
2018-11-19 04:48:58	~deepend	irc is pretty high on my list.. gopher is great as well if you find a good gopher hole:D 
2018-11-19 04:49:08	~ben	https://gopher.tildeverse.org/gopher.black for the weak 
2018-11-19 04:49:09	TildeBot	gopher.black https://bhh.sh/1vo
2018-11-19 04:50:20	~ben	irc is the top of my list
2018-11-19 04:50:28	~ben	i only post to my gopherhole if i post to my blog
2018-11-19 04:50:31	~ben	since it's mirrored there
2018-11-19 04:50:35	hyperboredoubt	Hmmm, maybe I'll break down and finally start using IRC one of these days.
2018-11-19 04:50:43	~ben	lol you're using it right now
2018-11-19 04:51:05	hyperboredoubt	Ah, I usually access it thought my browser though.
2018-11-19 04:51:15	~ben	oh that's fine
2018-11-19 04:51:19	~ben	there are some decent webclients
2018-11-19 04:51:22	~ben	like thelounge
2018-11-19 04:51:31	~ben	~team has one that will stay connected for you
2018-11-19 04:51:40	login	does that use password auth?
2018-11-19 04:51:42	ahriman	i hear kiwi is decent for webclients
2018-11-19 04:51:52	~ben	login: it can do sasl
2018-11-19 04:52:00	~ben	kiwi is ok
2018-11-19 04:52:03	~ben	thelounge is a bit nicer
2018-11-19 04:52:11	~ben	https://web.tilde.chat if you want to give it a look
2018-11-19 04:52:11	TildeBot	The Lounge 
2018-11-19 04:52:25	~deepend	I used to use kiwi back in the day.. I had shout running. but I think i've given up on it at this point.. 
2018-11-19 04:52:31	slipyx	tell em about teh glowing bears ben
2018-11-19 04:52:37	~ben	shout is what thelounge forked from
2018-11-19 04:52:39	hyperboredoubt	What do you all *do* with your cyberspace lives? While I'm online a lot, I feel stuck in a rut of the same few places, just like my physical life. :\
2018-11-19 04:52:55	~ben	glowing-bear is just a relay client though
2018-11-19 04:53:01	~ben	not a full-fledged client
2018-11-19 04:53:38	~ben	build cool projects, do some sysadmin stuff, chat with cool people doing other cool things
2018-11-19 04:53:40	~ben	etc
2018-11-19 04:53:45	~deepend	well someone should make a ssh client for web browser that is reasonably secure.. :D  
2018-11-19 04:54:00	~ben	no
2018-11-19 04:54:00	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-11-19 04:54:03	~ben	that's not a good idea
2018-11-19 04:54:10	hyperboredoubt	For example, I visit Neocities a lot because everyone keeps shouting the praises of internet brutalism and ditching Javascript, but I rarely see much worth checking out.
2018-11-19 04:54:13	~deepend	i know.. but it would be nice if it was a good idewa
2018-11-19 04:54:34	~ben	isn't neocities the geocities replacement thing?
2018-11-19 04:54:38	~ben	i think i made a site there once
2018-11-19 04:54:42	~ben	i wasn't that impressed
2018-11-19 04:54:53	~deepend	I'm not a big neocities fan.. and I really enjoyed geocities.
2018-11-19 04:55:08	hyperboredoubt	There is also NewHive.com and a few other places like that.
2018-11-19 04:55:35	~ben	a lot of times there's little reason for me to leave the tildeverse
2018-11-19 04:56:14	~deepend	I'm stuck in the tildeverse.. and if I feel I want more.. I just figure out a way to add what I want to my existing little world :P 
2018-11-19 04:56:21	~ben	^^
2018-11-19 04:56:31	hyperboredoubt	I feel like there was so much optimism and promise in the 90s that the internet never really delivered. Or maybe I'm just jaded and burnt out because I'm getting old. Maybe the good feelings were just the innocence of youth or some such shizz.
2018-11-19 04:56:59	hyperboredoubt	What have you added, deepend? :)
2018-11-19 04:57:08	slipyx	a human
2018-11-19 04:57:14	~ben	lol that too
2018-11-19 04:57:22	ahriman	how old are you hyperboredoubt 
2018-11-19 04:57:24	~ben	https://tildeverse.org has a list of the services we have up and running
2018-11-19 04:57:25	TildeBot	tildeverse 
2018-11-19 04:57:38	hyperboredoubt	I am 29, going on 30, ahriman.
2018-11-19 04:57:47	ahriman	same exactly
2018-11-19 04:57:50	slipyx	rip
2018-11-19 04:57:54	~deepend	the internet had promise and really was what I spent 99% of my time on in the 90s.. but somewhere along the way it started to feel different and I've only recently found a place I enjoy being online.. and here I am :) 
2018-11-19 04:58:15	~ben	this little community we've got here definitely fills a void
2018-11-19 04:58:35	ahriman	the tildeverse reminds me of how IRC and online communities felt circa 2000-2005
2018-11-19 04:59:08	~ben	before capitalism stole the internet
2018-11-19 04:59:13	ahriman	yeah basically
2018-11-19 04:59:22	~deepend	recently I've helped add stuff like the internet radio we have. as well as tube.tildeverse.org.. didn't know I wanted it until I did. lol  is great to be able to share a video with people and watch it in realtime at the same time and be able to talk about it
2018-11-19 04:59:48	ahriman	after that everything was so isolated and, paradoxically with the rise of social media, a-social
2018-11-19 04:59:50	hyperboredoubt	(How do I scroll up on this? I missed a large chunk of that text.)
2018-11-19 04:59:55	ahriman	pageUp
2018-11-19 04:59:56	~deepend	pg up
2018-11-19 04:59:59	~ben	tilderadio is relatively new too
2018-11-19 05:00:18	slipyx	ctrl+b, [ if you dont have pgup...
2018-11-19 05:00:31	~deepend	yeah..and most of this comes out of random comments people make. it seems :D 
2018-11-19 05:00:47	hyperboredoubt	Neither of those are working.
2018-11-19 05:00:56	~ben	what client are you using?
2018-11-19 05:01:08	~ben	pgup should work
2018-11-19 05:01:09	hyperboredoubt	Hmmm, I think... WeeChat 2.3.
2018-11-19 05:01:19	hyperboredoubt	I don't have pgup.
2018-11-19 05:01:27	~deepend	what client connects you to ssh to use it?
2018-11-19 05:01:30	~ben	fn+up arrow
2018-11-19 05:01:34	hyperboredoubt	Putty.
2018-11-19 05:01:38	~ben	that should emulate pgup
2018-11-19 05:01:41	~ben	maybe
2018-11-19 05:01:44	~ben	depends on the kb
2018-11-19 05:01:54	hyperboredoubt	Ah, fn+up seems to work.
2018-11-19 05:02:02	~deepend	winner winner chicken dinner! :D 
2018-11-19 05:02:14	~ben	fn+up down should be pgup pgdwn 
2018-11-19 05:02:16	ahriman	why is the page title of tilderadio 'eat poop or die'
2018-11-19 05:02:17	~ben	in most cases
2018-11-19 05:02:20	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 05:02:29	~ben	inside joke from the inaugural stream
2018-11-19 05:02:32	~deepend	lol
2018-11-19 05:02:36	slipyx	what if i dont have fn
2018-11-19 05:02:37	ahriman	o lol
2018-11-19 05:02:47	~deepend	wish we had a recording of that.. damnit
2018-11-19 05:03:11	hyperboredoubt	What is TildeTube?
2018-11-19 05:03:33	~ben	yeah i know i wish we had a recording of that one too
2018-11-19 05:03:37	~ben	https://tube.tildeverse.org
2018-11-19 05:03:38	TildeBot	tildetube 
2018-11-19 05:04:24	~ben	you can watch stuff simultaneously
2018-11-19 05:04:32	ahriman	i like how there's tildegit
2018-11-19 05:04:39	hyperboredoubt	Is it basically Twitch?
2018-11-19 05:04:49	hyperboredoubt	We should have TildePlaysPokemon, lol.
2018-11-19 05:04:51	~ben	tildegit is pretty nice
2018-11-19 05:04:57	~ben	more like rabb.it
2018-11-19 05:05:00	~ben	than twitch
2018-11-19 05:05:09	~ben	i don't know if there's a way to stream your own screen
2018-11-19 05:05:32	hyperboredoubt	I've never heard of rabb.it until now.
2018-11-19 05:06:26	~ben	for watching movies etc simultaneously
2018-11-19 05:07:11	~deepend	technically tildetube can be used for the same.. but need a place to play it from.. it does accept raw video tho.. so probably not too hard
2018-11-19 05:07:45	hyperboredoubt	We should watch Law & Order: SVU to critique the police state but also find viable anti-hierarchical means of addressing sexual assault.
2018-11-19 05:08:31	hyperboredoubt	This is mostly just an excuse for me to watch the fun twists in police procedurals, lol.
2018-11-19 05:09:00	ahriman	hyperboredoubt have you ever watched The Killing w/ Mireille Enos & Joel Kinnaman?
2018-11-19 05:09:24	slipyx	or we could just watch anime
2018-11-19 05:09:42	ahriman	or we could watch cheesy steven seagal movies
2018-11-19 05:09:57	~deepend	sweet
2018-11-19 05:11:45	hyperboredoubt	No, is it any good? I only watch old anime these days. The new stuff is all yuri trash and moe shit.
2018-11-19 05:12:16	ahriman	yeah it's really good. a police procedural, but the first two seasons are one case, the third is a second case, and the fourth is a third case
2018-11-19 05:12:40	hyperboredoubt	And I'd rather not watch any more Steven Seagal. I got enough of him as I was growing up.
2018-11-19 05:12:57	ahriman	blasphemer
2018-11-19 05:12:58	hyperboredoubt	That might be a good show.
2018-11-19 05:13:29	ahriman	it is. first case is the best, second is good, third is okay but necessary to wrap up everything
2018-11-19 05:13:45	hyperboredoubt	Who is more overrated Jean-Claude Van Damme or Chuck Norris?
2018-11-19 05:13:53	ahriman	chuck norris
2018-11-19 05:14:10	hyperboredoubt	True.
2018-11-19 05:14:27	ahriman	van damme has bloodsport
2018-11-19 05:14:55	ahriman	norris has shitty internet jokes and a bad tv show
2018-11-19 05:15:00	hyperboredoubt	I had an idea in the shower the other day. How about a site or service that is built around the idea of limitations and scarcity at every level?
2018-11-19 05:15:11	ahriman	go on
2018-11-19 05:17:04	hyperboredoubt	Basically, limited hardware with a limited budget, and even go so far as to ration the total number of characters that can be used. And by that last point, I don't mean *just* like Twitter's 140 characters, but rather the community as a whole would have a daily alottment of X-amount of letters and spaces.
2018-11-19 05:17:48	hyperboredoubt	It is sort of a play on that one post on /r/SurrealMemes where they were rationing the color red, haha.
2018-11-19 05:18:08	ahriman	would the goal be to recreate an old timesharing unix installation?
2018-11-19 05:18:33	hyperboredoubt	And maybe, to make it seem extra special, it is only accessible during certain time periods like Chakai.org/tea .
2018-11-19 05:19:05	hyperboredoubt	Not sure. I've never had a Unix installation. But I assume it would be similar.
2018-11-19 05:21:55	 *	hyperboredoubt killed the chat.
2018-11-19 05:21:59	ahriman	oh youve never fucked with *nix? No linux or anything?
2018-11-19 05:23:27	slipyx	afaik, linux supports disk quotas and such
2018-11-19 05:23:39	slipyx	number of files and space usage
2018-11-19 05:24:39	hyperboredoubt	The most I've ever messed with is here on the tilde communities.
2018-11-19 05:24:56	~deepend	I could setup another tilde.. call it torture.yourtilde.com and make it impossible to use?  :D  sounds like fun to me :D 
2018-11-19 05:25:15	ahriman	interesting, have you ever wanted to give it a try?
2018-11-19 05:25:27	hyperboredoubt	I wouldn't even know what it is for.
2018-11-19 05:26:37	ahriman	just as a daily-use OS. if you ever get the inkling to try it, one of us here on one of the tildes will help or answer any questions
2018-11-19 05:27:15	hyperboredoubt	First: what is it? And why would anyone want to use it?
2018-11-19 05:28:10	hyperboredoubt	Second: Do you have any examples that I can peruse so I can see the fruits of the labor, as it were?
2018-11-19 05:28:41	ahriman	it's just another operating system you can use on your computer as an alternative to windows
2018-11-19 05:29:28	ahriman	you can install like ubuntu or another linux to a USB thumb drive and boot off of it to try it out. as long as you don't install it, it'll run off the usb stick and not touch your hard drive
2018-11-19 05:29:44	ahriman	but i don't advise using linux until youve done a lot of research
2018-11-19 05:30:27	ahriman	and make the decision "yes, i want to use this OS instead of windows" because it'll be a learning curve
2018-11-19 05:31:05	hyperboredoubt	I hate learning curves.
2018-11-19 05:31:37	~deepend	depends on your use case.. learning curve isn't as bad depending on needs
2018-11-19 05:33:12	ahriman	or if you're a pathological tinkerer like me
2018-11-19 05:33:38	fosslinux	lol
2018-11-19 05:35:08	~deepend	hi fosslinux  :D 
2018-11-19 05:35:39	hyperboredoubt	What would I even tinker with though?
2018-11-19 05:35:51	fosslinux	hi
2018-11-19 05:36:49	hyperboredoubt	Hi, fosslinux.
2018-11-19 05:37:01	fosslinux	whats happening
2018-11-19 05:37:47	hyperboredoubt	Chatting about what the future should have been.
2018-11-19 05:37:54	ahriman	hyperboredoubt: on linux you can tinker with literally everything, even the source code
2018-11-19 05:38:17	hyperboredoubt	But why would I want to?
2018-11-19 05:38:48	~deepend	if thats your thing.. if not there are plenty of great distros that are basically install and go.. why is always the part that is different for every person. 
2018-11-19 05:38:50	ahriman	if you were a tinkerer
2018-11-19 05:39:00	slipyx	because you prefer color in your bash prompt and disagree with the default setting
2018-11-19 05:39:11	ahriman	theres a million reasons
2018-11-19 05:40:09	hyperboredoubt	Name seven hundred, ahriman, lol.
2018-11-19 05:41:09	~deepend	hell name 10 that would convince.. :D  
2018-11-19 05:42:28	hyperboredoubt	Yes, ten will suffice.
2018-11-19 05:43:22	ahriman	1. control exactly what software is installed on your computer
2018-11-19 05:43:43	ahriman	2. control exactly how that software is configured and change it if the need arises
2018-11-19 05:44:11	ahriman	3. say you want to change the way a window manager / desktop environment behaves, edit the source code
2018-11-19 05:44:18	ahriman	4. same with the kernel
2018-11-19 05:44:29	ahriman	5. i wanna watch a movie now
2018-11-19 05:44:55	hyperboredoubt	This all assumes that I know how to fix something in the case that something inevitably goes wrong.
2018-11-19 05:45:23	ahriman	which is why i mentioned doing a lot of research before you decide whether or not you wanna try it
2018-11-19 05:45:41	ahriman	man this long underwear i have on is comfy and warm
2018-11-19 05:45:52	ahriman	perfect for the winter season
2018-11-19 05:46:09	ahriman	sorry that was off-topic
2018-11-19 05:46:32	hyperboredoubt	"Life is off-topic", something pseudo-deep.
2018-11-19 05:46:38	ahriman	lol
2018-11-19 05:47:27	~deepend	hyperboredoubt: my main reason is opensource.   not because I develop.(I couldnt write code to save my life) but I figure with as many eyes that are on the code in linux that the corporate greed bs is way less likely. 
2018-11-19 05:48:16	ahriman	that too ^^^^^^
2018-11-19 05:48:45	hyperboredoubt	Has anyone done anything with Temple OS?
2018-11-19 05:48:51	ahriman	lolno

2018-11-19 18:14:33	+tomasino	:D
2018-11-19 18:14:43	+tomasino	the r/l thing is tricky for some speakers
2018-11-19 18:15:23	cdmnky	it was partly my friend. it just sorta came to me after he described how the muscles in the mouth were used in some ways
2018-11-19 18:15:44	cdmnky	the "your tongue doesn't have to touch the front of the palate" thing was an eye opener

2018-11-19 18:16:21	+tomasino	languages are cool
2018-11-19 18:16:54	cdmnky	the other part was slurring on trombone. you have to tongue enough that it doesn't smear when you slide, but not too much to break the tone
2018-11-19 18:17:13	+aewens	Languages are very cool, especially with how they gradually change and drift naturally through the byproduct of cultural slang over time.
2018-11-19 18:17:16	cdmnky	the l/r type thing is how I do it

2018-11-19 18:46:03	+aewens	My one gripe with urxvt is that I cannot for the life of me get Ctrl-Shift-C or V to work for copy/paste with it.
2018-11-19 18:46:12	+jan6	really?
2018-11-19 18:46:25	+aewens	Yeah, try it yourself.
2018-11-19 18:46:26	+jan6	also why'd you need those specifically?

2018-11-19 18:47:08	+aewens	cdmnky: Yeah, as someone who is a keyboard shortcut user, that just feels *wrong*.
2018-11-19 18:47:20	+jan6	you just do ctrl-alt-c and v
2018-11-19 18:47:39	+jan6	that feels wrong, but it's the included way
2018-11-19 18:47:49	cdmnky	wow, that feels better
2018-11-19 18:48:17	+aewens	I might give it another try with the Ctrl-Alt way, it's been awhile since I last tried urxvt
2018-11-19 18:48:21	+jan6	also did you actually TRY to search for a solution? lol, there are addons and patches
2018-11-19 18:49:08	cdmnky	urxvt-perls arch package plus a couple xresources lines does the trick too

2018-11-19 18:49:15	+aewens	I tried using the clipboard and other packages with it, but they appeared to have bugs at the time I was using them.
2018-11-19 18:49:27	+jan6	tl-dr, you use extentions/plugins for most stuff in rxvt
2018-11-19 18:49:27	%ubergeek	Shift-Insert
2018-11-19 18:51:01	+aewens	jan6: Yeah, I tried that something like that but I think it was December of 2015 when I last messed around with it.
2018-11-19 18:51:15	+aewens	So those links you sent didn't really exist then.
2018-11-19 18:51:51	+jan6	and that might not work btw, the top solution
2018-11-19 18:53:15	cdmnky	there's this thread on r/archlinux about which network manager to use. That's the most annoying thing about arch tbh, networks
2018-11-19 18:53:29	cdmnky	https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/9yi87s/arch_users_how_do_you_manage_networking/
2018-11-19 18:53:31	TildeBot	Arch users, how do you manage networking? : archlinux https://bhh.sh/20e
2018-11-19 18:54:48	+aewens	cdmnky: When I last used arch I just hand-wrote the interface files and used the if* tools
2018-11-19 18:55:06	cdmnky	that sounds complicated
2018-11-19 18:55:37	cdmnky	i used to use networkmanager applet, but once I found out about wpa_passphrase, I never used networkmanager again
2018-11-19 18:55:45	+aewens	At the time I just recently got certified in networking stuff, so it was kinda easier at the time for me to do it that way.
2018-11-19 18:55:53	cdmnky	i see
2018-11-19 18:56:49	+jan6	ah the thing works, really
2018-11-19 18:56:51	+jan6	coolio
2018-11-19 18:57:02	+jan6	ln -s ~/.Xresources ~/.Xdefaults
2018-11-19 18:57:03	+jan6	is a must
2018-11-19 18:57:21	+jan6	after making that xresources
2018-11-19 18:57:24	cdmnky	xrdb merge ~/.Xresources
2018-11-19 18:57:40	cdmnky	add that to xinitrc or something
2018-11-19 18:57:58	+jan6	xinitrc
2018-11-19 18:58:00	+jan6	If you are using a copy of the default xinitrc as your .xinitrc it already merges ~/.Xresources.
2018-11-19 18:58:02	+jan6	If you are using a custom .xinitrc add the following line:
2018-11-19 18:58:04	+jan6	[[ -f ~/.Xresources ]] && xrdb -merge -I$HOME ~/.Xresources
2018-11-19 18:58:06	+jan6	Note: Do not background the xrdb command within ~/.xinitrc. Otherwise, programs launched after xrdb may look for resources before it has finished loading them.

2018-11-19 18:58:41	+jan6	I still reccommend to symlink xdefaults
2018-11-19 18:59:05	+jan6	also turn off that iso-whatever mode
2018-11-19 19:02:16	+tomasino	alacritty got scrollback recently, which is sad
2018-11-19 19:02:22	+tomasino	it's meant to be used with a multiplexer
2018-11-19 19:02:27	+jan6	sad?
2018-11-19 19:02:31	+jan6	oof

2018-11-19 19:03:19	+jan6	it needs minimal code too
2018-11-19 19:03:26	+tomasino	tmux gives you scrollback already
2018-11-19 19:03:32	+jan6	look at ST's scrollback patch
2018-11-19 19:03:43	amcclure[team]	anyone know why when I tried to load my yourtilde site it'll just try to download a file called "~amcclure.man"?

2018-11-19 21:29:10	+aewens	Fun fact: If you're using CentOS on skylake server motherboards, all kernels before CentOS 7.4 will not work with the board.
2018-11-19 21:30:13	+aewens	Other fun fact: Using SSH to tunnel ports to your local machine is much easier to do with VNC than for IPMI's iKVM ports.
2018-11-19 21:30:48	+aewens	Other other fun fact: Trying to remotely troubleshooting cloning software is really annoying.

2018-11-19 21:32:43	+aewens	cdmnky: There's a section in your account called "Improve your recommendations" or something like that, you can go in and remove items purchased that will influence your ads from Amazon.
2018-11-19 21:33:28	cdmnky	aewens: i'd rather not have targeted advertizing all together, but i guess there's no solution to that other than not use online stores
2018-11-19 21:34:00	+aewens	I kinda appreciate it on Amazon since it will help me find tech stuff I didn't already know about.

2018-11-19 21:52:54	+jan6	is ˇ included?
2018-11-19 21:53:01	~ben	that's included in input mono
2018-11-19 21:53:01	cdmnky	monaco here
2018-11-19 21:53:05	~ben	which is the one i'm using
2018-11-19 21:53:12	+aewens	jan6: You may also like Noto
2018-11-19 21:53:15	~ben	http://input.fontbureau.com/
2018-11-19 21:53:15	+jan6	what about °¨
2018-11-19 21:53:16	TildeBot	Input: Fonts for Code 
2018-11-19 21:53:26	~ben	input has all of those weird stuff you've sent
2018-11-19 21:53:39	cdmnky	I also have unifont installed. it's not pretty but fills in the gaps
2018-11-19 21:53:46	~ben	i like it for weechat but not as much in an editor idk why
2018-11-19 21:53:51	~ben	re: input mono
2018-11-19 21:54:24	+jan6	I guess I'll go back to noto mono, if you so insist
2018-11-19 21:54:44	+jan6	you're lucky I'm not bothering with comic sans in terminal ;P
2018-11-19 21:55:00	+jan6	my phone's system font is ACTUALLY COMIC SANS
2018-11-19 21:55:03	~ben	i mean keep using that if you're that much of a masochist
2018-11-19 21:55:06	~ben	jfc
2018-11-19 21:55:10	~ben	why
2018-11-19 21:55:10	tildebeast	i like fantasque mono. though my conversion to a VT font bitmap font left something to be desired :)
2018-11-19 21:55:26	 *	jan6 likes comic sans-ed phone
2018-11-19 21:55:48	 *	aewens feels jan6 should re-evaluate their life choices
2018-11-19 21:55:56	+jan6	lol
2018-11-19 21:56:10	+jan6	if you say so, I'll use plex for terminal then
2018-11-19 21:56:22	~ben	plex is the one included with hacker.css
2018-11-19 21:56:27	+jan6	comical sanzzz
2018-11-19 21:57:01	tildebeast	all-caps stencil fonts are great in the terminal. they introduce a welcome sense of uncertainty in a case-sensitive OS...
2018-11-19 21:57:08	~ben	fantasque mono: haven't heard of that one
2018-11-19 21:57:16	brendantcc_lounge	so wut happening ppl
2018-11-19 21:58:01	tildebeast	i heard it described as 'comic sans mono' but that slur was settled on the field of honour. it's quite a nice little terminal font.
2018-11-19 21:58:16	+jan6	as I said, I use comic sans on my phone, and as I was saying, the giteabot's colors are too dark imo, not much else's happening
2018-11-19 21:58:58	+jan6	also I think I checked that out, it's nowhere near comic sans
2018-11-19 21:59:10	brendantcc_lounge	so jan6 isnt sleps yet?
2018-11-19 21:59:22	tildebeast	thank you jan6. it's nice to have the opportunity to agree with you :P
2018-11-19 21:59:28	+jan6	I mean it's literally midnight here
2018-11-19 21:59:36	+jan6	so I guess I'll sleep soon
2018-11-19 21:59:51	tildebeast	jan6, that puts you around the balkans somewhere?
2018-11-19 22:00:09	~ben	.ee 
2018-11-19 22:00:32	 *	jan6 wonders if there's a way to use css variables and stuff to make themeable pages without javascript or php or stuff...probably not...
2018-11-19 22:00:44	~ben	jan6: check out less or sass
2018-11-19 22:00:52	+jan6	nay way
2018-11-19 22:00:54	~ben	it's compiled, but definitely an option
2018-11-19 22:01:03	+jan6	it's not, BECAUSE it's compiled
2018-11-19 22:01:06	cdmnky	android force updating my phone when I'm waiting on a text
2018-11-19 22:01:18	tildebeast	looked at some tutorials and they both looked, like, way cool. didn't take it further though

2018-11-19 22:02:58	+jan6	I know of it, and don't need it much
2018-11-19 22:03:14	~ben	light backgrounds hurt my eyes
2018-11-19 22:03:52	+jan6	if coming from a dark site, sure
2018-11-19 22:04:40	~ben	that too
2018-11-19 22:04:58	+aewens	Are we racially profiling websites now? Because I feel a site should be judged by it's content and not by the color of it's background.
2018-11-19 22:05:08	~ben	what
2018-11-19 22:05:18	~ben	not relevant
2018-11-19 22:05:28	~ben	there's no race associated with web colors
2018-11-19 22:05:49	+jan6	you just force change the face of the site, in order to not die from exposure of brilliance
2018-11-19 22:06:14	~ben	i just have darkreader on all the time
2018-11-19 22:06:17	+aewens	Racially may have been the wrong word. Shadially? Huely?
2018-11-19 22:06:22	tildebeast	agreed ben. white site backgrounds on a 4k monitor are like staring into a lighthouse from 3 feet away
2018-11-19 22:06:34	~ben	on *any* monitor 
2018-11-19 22:06:35	~ben	:P
2018-11-19 22:06:39	tildebeast	it's a matter of eyesight rather than prejudice
2018-11-19 22:06:41	tildebeast	yup
2018-11-19 22:06:56	~ben	probably from spending so much time in front of a screen
2018-11-19 22:06:58	+aewens	What's a -ly word that means distinguishing between black/dark and white/bright things?
2018-11-19 22:07:11	mushmouth	ben: it nice to get out their and talk with real people
2018-11-19 22:07:18	+jan6	contrastly
2018-11-19 22:07:18	tildebeast	i like the firefox 'article reader' mode which can be set to dark. and 'auto night mode' etc. plus of course lynx in a dark terminal.
2018-11-19 22:07:23	mushmouth	that way you don't have these real ideas
2018-11-19 22:07:26	mushmouth	weird
2018-11-19 22:07:28	mushmouth	blah
2018-11-19 22:07:39	+jan6	contrastly I just hate pure white

2018-11-19 22:07:55	tildebeast	who are these 'real people' and why do they want to talk to us? doesn't sound very trustworthy to me...
2018-11-19 22:08:00	+jan6	you need root for dat .[
2018-11-19 22:08:17	mushmouth	jan6: is a real person. they are even married to me can you believe it! :P
2018-11-19 22:08:27	+jan6	YOU FOUND REAL PEOPLE? I AM EXPRESSING MY TOTALLY HUMAN EXITEMENT!
2018-11-19 22:08:45	ahriman	i just installed darkreader, this is really nice
2018-11-19 22:08:54	tildebeast	wow, folk here know and interact with each other in meatspace? that's pretty nice actually.
2018-11-19 22:09:28	+jan6	mush has taken to calling himself married to me, just like I did with tildebot, lol, I am still tildebot's master no matter if yo ulike it or not
2018-11-19 22:09:29	TildeBot	jan6, <Ben> yo yo yo yo yo.

2018-11-19 22:09:55	+jan6	we ARE in a tilde meetup rn
2018-11-19 22:10:03	~ben	i haven't really gotten back to full social mode since moving
2018-11-19 22:10:15	tildebeast	it was weird going to a conference for the first time a few weeks ago and meeting regular (within error bars) people who i'd otherwise only have met online
2018-11-19 22:10:22	~ben	but i've got a decent group of friends here and we do at least one get together a week
2018-11-19 22:10:32	ahriman	i have been isolating a bit since i moved three states, though. right now i mostly socialize with my room mates
2018-11-19 22:10:33	mushmouth	i don't have many irl friends :(
2018-11-19 22:10:43	mushmouth	mostly from game stores when i meet them
2018-11-19 22:10:45	tildebeast	ain't we a bit globally distributed to manage a RL meet?
2018-11-19 22:11:01	~ben	vilmibm is moving to chicago soon, which is only 5 hours away
2018-11-19 22:11:03	~ben	from me

2018-11-19 22:11:24	+jan6	what are friends?
2018-11-19 22:11:25	~ben	that's close!
2018-11-19 22:11:27	mushmouth	ben: you should be like. hey town hug box.then walk away as a joke
2018-11-19 22:11:30	mushmouth	when you meet
2018-11-19 22:11:38	~ben	?
2018-11-19 22:11:44	mushmouth	you should meet up with vil
2018-11-19 22:11:51	mushmouth	then say "hey town hug box" then walk away
2018-11-19 22:11:58	~ben	i don't get the reference
2018-11-19 22:12:05	+jan6	never give mush the address of tildemeet & co.
2018-11-19 22:12:06	~ben	probably will though
2018-11-19 22:12:11	mushmouth	i lost faith in humanity just now
2018-11-19 22:12:17	tildebeast	when i went to DC I was walking down the street and saw an old enemy from my senior school in England. We glared at each other and just kept walking :)
2018-11-19 22:12:18	~ben	i have a couple other friends that i'd like to see in chi-town
2018-11-19 22:12:28	+jan6	you HAD any faith left? I'm impressed, mushmouth 
2018-11-19 22:12:34	~ben	DC as in washington tildebeast ?

2018-11-19 22:13:53	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 22:13:56	tildebeast	actually it was longer ago. just after Gulf I. huge, bored police presence on the Mall amusing themselves by arresting Grateful Dead fans :/
2018-11-19 22:13:57	mushmouth	ben play it on the radio
2018-11-19 22:14:00	mushmouth	for lols
2018-11-19 22:14:11	~ben	classic merica
2018-11-19 22:15:14	tildebeast	i escaped lightly. was being given a lift home by some guy i'd chatted to in a museum cafe. was rolling up a spliff in his car right under the watchful eye of DC's finest. bit of a scary moment :)
2018-11-19 22:15:32	~ben	ballsy move, that is
2018-11-19 22:16:45	tildebeast	i only noticed the cops next to the car window *after* i started sorting seeds from flowers :)
2018-11-19 22:16:55	tildebeast	don't indulge these days of course
2018-11-19 22:17:06	~ben	lmao
2018-11-19 22:17:25	~ben	i don't either; makes me paranoid
2018-11-19 22:17:29	tildebeast	ditto
2018-11-19 22:17:37	~ben	i'll stick to my beer and wine
2018-11-19 22:17:42	tildebeast	yup, same here
2018-11-19 22:18:32	tildebeast	damn. completely forgot why i logged on this evening.
2018-11-19 22:18:36	 *	tildebeast scratches head
2018-11-19 22:18:42	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 22:18:55	~ben	at this point, i log on because i log on
2018-11-19 22:19:00	tildebeast	sounds about right 
2018-11-19 22:19:21	~ben	and then it goes from there
2018-11-19 22:19:24	tildebeast	ah. knew it'd come to me. anyone know their way around TCP/IP handshaking?
2018-11-19 22:19:34	~ben	uuf 
2018-11-19 22:19:44	~ben	learned a bit in undergrad but i've all but forgotten it
2018-11-19 22:20:14	tildebeast	just wondering if it's done between hostnames, IP addresses or MAC addresses.
2018-11-19 22:21:12	~ben	ahh good question
2018-11-19 22:21:15	~ben	i don't recall :/
2018-11-19 22:23:00	tildebeast	i think it's IP addresses.
2018-11-19 22:23:27	tildebeast	Just writing a 'Good manners guide for hosts' for the tilde.town zine :)
2018-11-19 22:23:46	dokuja1	TCP is between IPs
2018-11-19 22:23:51	tildebeast	thanks dokuja1 
2018-11-19 22:24:07	~ben	oh! i think we're trying to get one going for the tildeverse too
2018-11-19 22:24:11	~ben	forgot town had their own zine
2018-11-19 22:24:13	tildebeast	cool.

2018-11-19 22:24:22	~ben	just an empty repo at this point
2018-11-19 22:24:43	tildebeast	i was just reading a 'correct letter writing' guide from early 20th century and had the idea of doing the same for inter-computer comms...
2018-11-19 22:25:35	+jan6	comms...when's the last time you used that term?
2018-11-19 22:25:37	tildebeast	...thinking that it would be nice if our computer overlords started their reign with an understanding of good manners and mutual respect
2018-11-19 22:25:48	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 22:25:52	tildebeast	quite recently jan6. it's still current in some fields
2018-11-19 22:25:54	~ben	good manners are important
2018-11-19 22:25:57	tildebeast	indeed.
2018-11-19 22:26:47	tildebeast	anyway, it's a dumb idea but i now have to make it look like a page from an old book, so a bit of typographical research required 
2018-11-19 22:27:02	~ben	ooo nice
2018-11-19 22:27:06	~ben	LaTeX time?
2018-11-19 22:27:20	mushmouth	those feels when playing music rhythm games and you know you can do better
2018-11-19 22:27:29	mushmouth	but mental and physical limitation
2018-11-19 22:27:48	tildebeast	LaTeX would do a great job but I still have an Indesign license for a couple of months, which'll be much quicker for me.
2018-11-19 22:27:59	~ben	ahh that could do it
2018-11-19 22:28:12	~ben	never really learned any of the cc suite well enough 
2018-11-19 22:28:58	tildebeast	i'm 'retiring' from that side of freelancing after Xmas as 'bad eyes' and 'bored witless after 30 years of it'. but it's still handy to have access now and then.
2018-11-19 22:30:07	tildebeast	guess we all hit our limits at some point mushmouth 
2018-11-19 22:30:20	mushmouth	tildebeast: it just sucks
2018-11-19 22:30:37	tildebeast	guess so
2018-11-19 22:31:16	tildebeast	i keep rythm like someone falling downstairs so i always envy someone who can hold/split beats etc.
2018-11-19 22:31:43	mushmouth	i get really scared of like falling down stares
2018-11-19 22:31:45	mushmouth	stairs
2018-11-19 22:31:50	tildebeast	it's no fun
2018-11-19 22:32:13	tildebeast	bouncy castle stairs excepted. that can be fun.
2018-11-19 22:32:28	ahriman	that is indeed fun tildebeast 
2018-11-19 22:33:46	tildebeast	it's about beer o'clock in these parts. thanks all for a lovely chat. see you around...
2018-11-19 22:35:38	ahriman	haha have fun
2018-11-19 22:36:10	~ben	beer o'clock sounds great
2018-11-19 22:36:21	~ben	i need to stop at the grocery store and get some
2018-11-19 22:36:53	 *	jan6 suddenly dies, falling into the night
2018-11-19 22:43:30	sebboh	I have a bookmark toolbar folder named 'comms'.
2018-11-19 22:43:45	sebboh	so I use (well, see) the term daily.
2018-11-19 22:43:47	~ben	i feel like i've used it recently too
2018-11-19 23:00:21	zyeri	<3 LaTeX
2018-11-19 23:05:22	~ben	markdown -> pandoc -> latex -> pdf ?
2018-11-19 23:05:24	~ben	lol
2018-11-19 23:05:42	zyeri	that's how I started with it
2018-11-19 23:05:52	zyeri	now I just write in latex directly
2018-11-19 23:05:57	~ben	owo nice
2018-11-19 23:06:04	~ben	i've written up a couple things with latex
2018-11-19 23:06:09	zyeri	emacs + auctex makes it nice and painful
2018-11-19 23:06:11	~ben	but rarely have any use for it lately
2018-11-19 23:06:16	zyeri	rather than not nice and very painful
2018-11-19 23:06:21	~ben	omf
2018-11-19 23:06:28	~ben	i was just about to ask if painful was a typo
2018-11-19 23:06:33	zyeri	lol
2018-11-19 23:06:43	zyeri	nah, as much as I love it, latex is a massive pain in the ass to work with
2018-11-19 23:06:47	zyeri	but the results are worth it
2018-11-19 23:06:49	~ben	sure is!
2018-11-19 23:07:00	~ben	texlive-full is installed on ~team if you ever need it

2018-11-19 23:07:27	~ben	biglysmalls was working on this bad boi
2018-11-19 23:07:56	zyeri	these days I'm using org-mode w/ pdf export via latex for some stuff (e.g. homework, notes, etc.), but I still mostly use latex directly
2018-11-19 23:09:57	~ben	i'm not familiar with org-mode
2018-11-19 23:10:02	~ben	heard good things though
2018-11-19 23:10:33	zyeri	org-mode and magit are the two reasons I started using Emacs
2018-11-19 23:10:59	~ben	ohh also heard good things about that too
2018-11-19 23:11:04	~ben	magit, that is
2018-11-19 23:11:10	zyeri	magit is amazing
2018-11-19 23:12:29	~ben	tried to get it set up at one point and i was too learning curved out to be productive so i just went back to my standard git nonsense
2018-11-19 23:12:46	zyeri	yeah it takes some getting used to
2018-11-19 23:13:36	zyeri	especially if you're not used to how Emacs does things in the first place
2018-11-19 23:13:40	~ben	readline keybinds are pretty much the only emacs artifact i know
2018-11-19 23:13:53	~ben	yeah i have 0 emacs knowledge lol
2018-11-19 23:14:28	zyeri	yeaaaaah emacs is a pain in the ass to learn
2018-11-19 23:14:36	zyeri	especially if you're coming from vim, like I did
2018-11-19 23:14:45	~ben	productivity hit was not worth the time investment for me :P
2018-11-19 23:14:50	~ben	yeah i'm a vimmer
2018-11-19 23:15:02	zyeri	evil-mode can help, but you eventually will need to learn how Emacs does things (including emacs-lisp)
2018-11-19 23:15:42	zyeri	I still use vim (well, neovim) sometimes (and evil-mode too), but mostly I stick with Emacs bindings
2018-11-19 23:15:49	zyeri	except in zsh, where I keep the vi mode on
2018-11-19 23:16:11	zyeri	that's more out of laziness for not wanting to rework configs though
2018-11-19 23:17:42	~ben	what's the benefit though?
2018-11-19 23:20:04	~ben	like what do i get from learning all this stuff
2018-11-19 23:25:04	zyeri	well what's the benefit from learning anything?
2018-11-19 23:25:27	zyeri	for me, I'm not 100% as productive at pure editing with Emacs as I am with vim
2018-11-19 23:25:49	+aewens	The benefit is one day getting Emacs Pinky and being able to tell young whipper snappers that Visual Code is for chumps when you could just never leave Emacs and always be editing it's config files to suit your needs.
2018-11-19 23:26:01	zyeri	but the features (and packages) Emacs provides things that I want and use that vim can't/doesn't
2018-11-19 23:26:13	zyeri	Visual Code /is/ for chumps /s
2018-11-19 23:26:25	~ben	lmao
2018-11-19 23:26:27	~ben	so streetcred
2018-11-19 23:26:45	zyeri	yes but also no?
2018-11-19 23:26:56	zyeri	Emacs can do things that vim, vs code, sublime, whatever, can't
2018-11-19 23:27:07	zyeri	just like vim can do things the others can't, vs code can do things the others can't
2018-11-19 23:27:10	zyeri	etc
2018-11-19 23:27:14	~ben	right
2018-11-19 23:27:31	zyeri	it's mostly a matter of which "things" you care about
2018-11-19 23:27:41	+aewens	ben: It's a way of life. It's like asking what benefits of yoga is if you don't also embrace the culture of meditation and the path to finding one's zen.
2018-11-19 23:27:44	zyeri	for me? I care about what Emacs can do more than what vim etc. can
2018-11-19 23:28:10	+aewens	Whereas vim is a tool that does what it says it will do: help you efficiently edit files.
2018-11-19 23:28:24	zyeri	vim is definitely a tool, but that's all it is
2018-11-19 23:28:36	+aewens	Exactly, and that's what makes it great.
2018-11-19 23:28:37	zyeri	while emacs is a platform that is used to implement tools
2018-11-19 23:28:46	zyeri	some of its tools (editing) aren't so good
2018-11-19 23:28:49	+aewens	Emacs is a nice OS that lacks a decent text editor.
2018-11-19 23:28:56	zyeri	some of them (org-mode) are /excellent/
2018-11-19 23:29:31	+aewens	However, that's what all the packages and config files are for, to try and make it a usable text editor.
2018-11-19 23:30:03	zyeri	my init.el is 1129 lines long. D:
2018-11-19 23:30:24	zyeri	starts up pretty quickly though! <3 use-package
2018-11-19 23:31:33	~ben	a platform instead of a tool
2018-11-19 23:31:36	~ben	that's a good way to put it
2018-11-19 23:32:30	+aewens	My .vimrc is about 15-20ish lines I think? And the only fancy thing it does is maps jj to Esc and F2 toggle paste within insert mode. The rest is just stylist stuff.
2018-11-19 23:34:22	+aewens	Anyways, I'm gonna head out for the day. Have fun everyone.
2018-11-19 23:36:16	zyeri	oh mah, my init.vim (neovim) is 873 lines long
2018-11-19 23:36:23	zyeri	a lot of it is "junk" though
2018-11-19 23:36:41	zyeri	like, stuff that's used but wouldn't cause issues if I removed it
2018-11-19 23:38:18	~ben	my .vimrc is quite short as well
2018-11-19 23:38:27	~ben	and i have nvim configured to just use my .vimrc
2018-11-19 23:39:41	zyeri	I've been meaning to rework my vim config since vim 8 was released to detect which I'm using (neovim vs. vim 8+) and disable/enable certain bits based on that
2018-11-19 23:39:45	zyeri	buuuuut laziness
2018-11-19 23:45:02	brendantcc_lounge	hey hi again
2018-11-19 23:51:20	~ben	mine's barebones enough that i don't really need to change anything

2018-11-20 01:46:08	+tomasino	what's the best place to link people to as an introduction to tilde stuff as a whole?
2018-11-20 01:47:56	~ben	that's a good question tomasino 
2018-11-20 01:48:08	~ben	tildeverse.org doesn't really have any info
2018-11-20 02:00:58	+tomasino	gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20181119-space-gopher-revisited
2018-11-20 02:01:04	+tomasino	ben, relevant to our discussion
2018-11-20 02:02:04	~ben	qec aka ansible?
2018-11-20 02:02:06	~ben	:P
2018-11-20 02:03:14	+tomasino	is that a thing? i don't ansible
2018-11-20 02:03:51	~ben	oh no ansible from the ender's game series
2018-11-20 02:03:58	~ben	not the server thing
2018-11-20 02:04:08	~ben	which got its name from the ender's game tool

2018-11-20 02:04:57	~ben	oh looks like le guin coined the term

2018-11-20 02:05:34	~ben	yup!
2018-11-20 02:05:45	~ben	that's why i mentioned it lol
2018-11-20 02:06:21	+tomasino	:D cool
2018-11-20 02:08:41	~ben	that was one of my favorite books as a kid
2018-11-20 02:08:43	~ben	for sure
2018-11-20 02:10:02	+tomasino	i read ender's shadow not as long ago and enjoyed it
2018-11-20 02:10:11	+tomasino	i think the series stopped being as cool after the first book when i was a kid
2018-11-20 02:10:16	+tomasino	it didn't capture me like dune
2018-11-20 02:11:11	~ben	yeah the first book was definitely the best

2018-11-20 03:06:37	+tomasino	and then it stopped
2018-11-20 03:06:44	~ben	lol yeah chat kinda died
2018-11-20 03:06:47	+tomasino	awesomeness was brief
2018-11-20 03:07:00	+tomasino	i watched the first 2 episodes of cobra kai, though
2018-11-20 03:07:03	+tomasino	so that's a thing
2018-11-20 03:07:12	~ben	noice
2018-11-20 03:07:30	+tomasino	so ben, you gonna journey to the stars with me?
2018-11-20 03:07:38	~ben	i'm down
2018-11-20 03:07:41	~ben	let's go
2018-11-20 03:07:51	+tomasino	badassery
2018-11-20 03:08:21	+tomasino	i need to figure out a good mechanism for tilde-ing that gives ONLY gopher access, and only plain text
2018-11-20 03:08:59	~ben	irc also? 
2018-11-20 03:09:07	~ben	or are you thinking just lmtp and gopher
2018-11-20 03:09:26	~ben	you can add ssh keys with limitations
2018-11-20 03:09:30	~ben	to shell accounts
2018-11-20 03:10:12	+tomasino	i want to keep this one pretty locked down since in-game the only comms would be over that ancient protocol
2018-11-20 03:10:20	+tomasino	irc or bbj or something feels like cheating
2018-11-20 03:12:59	~ben	yeah that makes snese
2018-11-20 03:13:05	~ben	lmtp and gopher 
2018-11-20 03:14:52	hyperboredoubt	What is LMTP?
2018-11-20 03:15:41	~ben	local mail transfer protocol
2018-11-20 03:15:53	~ben	basically email but only locally within one machine
2018-11-20 03:16:32	hyperboredoubt	Cool.
2018-11-20 03:16:49	hyperboredoubt	Like what Hillary Clinton used? ;D
2018-11-20 03:17:02	~ben	tbh i have no idea what she was using
2018-11-20 03:17:12	~ben	possibly?
2018-11-20 03:25:26	+tomasino	does circumlunar even have a login shell? isn't it scp or sftp only?
2018-11-20 03:25:31	+tomasino	maybe i'll do that
2018-11-20 03:25:47	+tomasino	rssh
2018-11-20 03:28:31	hyperboredoubt	Oooh, I've been meaning to check out Circumlunar. I love themed communities.
2018-11-20 03:29:53	~ben	more gopher!

2018-11-20 14:10:20	+jan6	well, it's fine on literally every other device I've seen it on
2018-11-20 14:10:38	~ben	it's still a theme thing
2018-11-20 14:10:51	+jan6	but whatever, I know, the container width is too small blablabla
2018-11-20 14:14:22	arne	And I finished it
2018-11-20 14:14:40	+jan6	good for you
2018-11-20 14:14:44	+jan6	what's it do?
2018-11-20 14:15:33	+jan6	bounce a ball around? have a realistic simulation of a sandbox with each grain calculated separately?
2018-11-20 14:59:02	 *	jan6 unsurprisingly finds lua to be much easier to do stuff with than pure bash & co.
2018-11-20 14:59:30	+jan6	started porting loady_thing.sh into lua, just cause why not

2018-11-20 15:55:00	+jan6	it's sure is easy to parse the script itself using it ;P
2018-11-20 15:56:13	+jan6	my loady_thing.sh get's it's helptext you know where? from parsing it's own code, drastically reduces the amount of stuff to write and keep updated

2018-11-20 15:57:18	~ben	self-documenting code is fun

2018-11-20 19:16:41	~ben	well that's a reasonable compensation for the headache!
2018-11-20 19:17:01	+tomasino	they were in a bad spot. If it was just a delay, the lease covered them, but since the apt wasn't going to be available at all I could have taken them to court for damages. I just want an apartment, so we found a happy middle
2018-11-20 19:24:24	~ben	what allowed the current tenants to stay?

2018-11-20 21:18:18	+jan6	if you mean ascii 3d, then I'm not sure anyone's made minecraft, per say...
2018-11-20 21:18:31	+jan6	but you can get awesome results anyway

2018-11-20 23:14:55	hyperboredoubt	Hi, erxeto.
2018-11-20 23:15:02	+tomasino	ergodox means learing qmk and dealing with firmware flashing
2018-11-20 23:15:09	+tomasino	but that's not a downside in my opinion
2018-11-20 23:15:14	~ben	tmyk
2018-11-20 23:15:15	+tomasino	it's more control
2018-11-20 23:15:30	+tomasino	price is the biggest downer
2018-11-20 23:15:36	+tomasino	ergo isn't very portable either
2018-11-20 23:15:36	~ben	learning curve is always a thing with a different paradigm like that
2018-11-20 23:15:47	erxeto	I don't mind that, I', kind of a hw geek ;-)
2018-11-20 23:15:58	+tomasino	if you can afford it, it's definitely the best
2018-11-20 23:16:22	+tomasino	the pok3r is great, but i wish it had a flashable firmware
2018-11-20 23:16:25	tildebeast	interesting how many me-too switch makers there are now offering colour-coded switches

2018-11-20 23:17:15	+tomasino	the model 1 is pretty, but it feels very home-grown. ergodox has had years to get their stuff in order

2018-11-20 23:19:31	erxeto	ben: writing with more or less 2 fingers for each hand and refusing to learn proper touch type
2018-11-20 23:19:32	 *	tomasino also eschews multiple screens
2018-11-20 23:19:38	 *	aewens needs to use a web UI to do his job at work
2018-11-20 23:19:40	~ben	oh boy only 4 fingers?
2018-11-20 23:19:54	~ben	at some point, you'll be touch typing and not notice it
2018-11-20 23:20:00	~ben	having learned it through repetition
2018-11-20 23:20:12	erxeto	I can be really efficient like that, but you pay a price
2018-11-20 23:20:25	erxeto	I try harder now
2018-11-20 23:20:30	~ben	i've been touch typing since i was like 12
2018-11-20 23:20:35	+tomasino	if you're not touch typing you might want to focus on that before you get the fancy keyboard
2018-11-20 23:20:51	~ben	yeah you'll get far more bang/buck with that
2018-11-20 23:21:07	erxeto	I know where keys are, just have to control the impulse and use the right key
2018-11-20 23:21:09	+aewens	When I was in school, I never did well with the typing programs they have you do to learn how to type quickly. But after a few months of programming I suddenly became able to touch type, weirdest thing.
2018-11-20 23:21:27	+tomasino	fix your eyes on the screen and don't look down
2018-11-20 23:21:40	+tomasino	i had a dev on my team that couldn't touch type and it drove me nuts
2018-11-20 23:21:51	+tomasino	so many times he's go heads down working on something only to look up and see he was in the wrong window
2018-11-20 23:21:56	 *	tomasino dies

2018-11-20 23:22:15	erxeto	I already noticed a pain reduction, but what really bothers me is the keys not being in columns !!
2018-11-20 23:22:35	+tomasino	you can get an ertho-linear if that's comfier
2018-11-20 23:22:47	+tomasino	i like the offset
2018-11-20 23:23:03	~ben	i don't notice the offset at all
2018-11-20 23:23:13	+aewens	The problem with touch typing for me is that it's a muscle memory. I can think a word and know how to type it without thinking about it, but if you gave me a blank keyboard to fill in the letters with I'd probably skrew it up.
2018-11-20 23:23:19	erxeto	yeah, I just thought tho have that and split and mechanical ... so I got tho the ergodox
2018-11-20 23:24:43	erxeto	and the fully programable stuff ... that's like a dream hehehehe
2018-11-20 23:25:54	erxeto	ben, it really kills me ... all is shifted to the left (which is nice in life/politics, but not in my hands ;-P )
2018-11-20 23:26:41	+aewens	I'd argue it's not nice in life/politics, but you do you.
2018-11-20 23:27:47	erxeto	aewens: we can have this conversation any time you want, now is 00:27 here and I'm almost going to bed ;-)
2018-11-20 23:28:17	erxeto	what timezone are you ?
2018-11-20 23:28:34	~ben	definitely nice in handwriting, life, and politics
2018-11-20 23:28:42	erxeto	hahaha
2018-11-20 23:28:43	+aewens	It's about 5 minutes before I head out of the office to face the commute home, so now is probably not the best time to get into it xD
2018-11-20 23:28:43	~ben	#politics is probably the place for that though
2018-11-20 23:28:57	~ben	i think aewens is on central time
2018-11-20 23:29:00	~ben	17:28

2018-11-20 23:29:24	erxeto	yeah, ~team is US centered mostly :-/
2018-11-20 23:29:53	+aewens	Well, it was made by a US person, so that adds up.
2018-11-20 23:30:43	~ben	there's a reasonable eu contingent
2018-11-20 23:30:49	erxeto	ok folks, thanks for your opinions on the geeky expensive keyboard subject
2018-11-20 23:30:53	~ben	lmao
2018-11-20 23:30:58	~ben	"geeky expensive"
2018-11-20 23:31:00	~ben	very accurate
2018-11-20 23:31:12	erxeto	totally accurate ;-P
2018-11-20 23:31:41	+aewens	erxeto: Don't forget to consider the new trend in typewriter-style keyboards so you can be modern and retro at the same time.
2018-11-20 23:32:42	~ben	lol those are probably not good for rsi
2018-11-20 23:33:18	erxeto	hahaha, I don't really care about the aesthetics (is that the right spelling?)

2018-11-20 23:33:59	erxeto	the ergodox is an strong candidate if I can justify to myself the freaking cost.
2018-11-20 23:34:09	~ben	lotsa cash
2018-11-20 23:34:21	erxeto	+ import taxes
2018-11-20 23:34:25	erxeto	you know ...
2018-11-20 23:34:50	+aewens	Anyways, I'm gonna head out. Have fun everyone.

2018-11-21 13:59:49	~ben	you're welcome to use gopher://fosslinux.tilde.team/1/~fosslinux
2018-11-21 14:00:05	mushmouth	i use netscape navigator for my gopher client on windows xp :)
2018-11-21 14:00:15	mushmouth	4.0.4
2018-11-21 14:04:10	mushmouth	it works well for gopher
2018-11-21 14:04:13	mushmouth	so no complaining
2018-11-21 14:07:46	epicmorphism	I don't think you can support virtual hosts on gopher
2018-11-21 14:07:55	epicmorphism	since a gopher request does not include a hostname
2018-11-21 14:08:17	mushmouth	it would be a protocol/mime-type?
2018-11-21 14:08:45	epicmorphism	huh? what do you mean?
2018-11-21 14:08:57	mushmouth	gopher would be that instead of vhost
2018-11-21 14:09:57	epicmorphism	i dont get it
2018-11-21 14:10:09	+jan6	you don't need vhosts for gopher anyway?
2018-11-21 14:10:20	+jan6	why'd you need multiple sites?
2018-11-21 14:10:33	mushmouth	jan6: gopher can't have multiple sites on same domain

2018-11-21 15:32:39	~ben	very carefully
2018-11-21 15:32:39	%ubergeek	send a nice email to the owner of the DNS pair?
2018-11-21 15:32:48	~ben	lol yeah
2018-11-21 15:32:57	amcclure	who owns the dns pair lol
2018-11-21 15:33:04	%ubergeek	Or, some neat webform, or something.  It can be as stringent, or as loosey-goosey as one wants.
2018-11-21 15:33:21	%ubergeek	amcclure: whoever sets up a pair of DNS servers, and everyone agrees to point at.
2018-11-21 15:33:38	cdmnky	create a voiceoverpete video? "Attention all DNS providers..."
2018-11-21 15:34:30	%ubergeek	I mean,quad 8 probably wont honor it, unless it's ICANN approved...  But, I don't inherently see that as a bad thing
2018-11-21 15:34:40	~ben	quad8 aka google?
2018-11-21 15:34:43	%ubergeek	yep

2018-11-21 15:36:57	%ubergeek	^^^

2018-11-21 15:37:19	%ubergeek	You also need financial records to prove you can fund operations for 10 years.

2018-11-21 15:38:09	%ubergeek	Well, ICANN swears it's like millions of dollars annually.
2018-11-21 15:38:47	%ubergeek	It's really just a racket.  A way of saying,"Nobody creates new TLDs, present company excluded, of course"

2018-11-21 15:39:35	~ben	yeah it's a racket

2018-11-21 18:08:13	+aewens	I found out last month my brother is using the same pin number as my parents, and more horrifying they use the same pin for the garage keypad.

2018-11-21 19:25:02	+jan6	do NOT look at die-shortly.sh if you thing die.sh is bad, lol
2018-11-21 19:25:29	+jan6	but I couldn't figure out how to embed it as an option in the main program
2018-11-21 19:26:32	+jan6	die.sh isn't too bad imo, die-shortly.sh is definitely madness
2018-11-21 19:26:46	+jan6	I have no clue where anything starts or stops in there
2018-11-21 19:26:56	+jan6	and I was the one that wrote it, lol
2018-11-21 19:27:23	+aewens	That's called "write-only" programming
2018-11-21 19:27:27	+jan6	heh

2018-11-21 19:27:54	+aewens	Which bash/perl can have a tendency of becoming very quickly.
2018-11-21 19:28:19	+jan6	>() is a cool bash feature tbh, allows for splitting up the pipes
2018-11-21 19:28:31	+aewens	What was the old saying? "When this began, only me and God knew how my code worked. Now, only God knows."

2018-11-21 19:28:56	+jan6	this is the first time that's happened, to be honest

2018-11-21 20:15:40	+aewens	Who are we to argue with science?
2018-11-21 20:20:34	+aewens	My work laptop is a 13" MacBook Pro 2018, it has an i5 and 8GB of RAM. You'd think that pressing Cmd+Space to bring up spotlight so I can do some quick math would be an easy task for it to handle, right?
2018-11-21 20:21:45	+aewens	Nope, the whole UI freezes up and the network stutters (or at least, the music I'm listening to on pandora through the `pianobar` commands stutters).
2018-11-21 20:21:54	+jan6	pfffff
2018-11-21 20:22:24	+aewens	This is why I use Linux for my personal machines now.

2018-11-21 20:38:20	+jan6	same
2018-11-21 20:41:09	+jan6	chromium's not too bad tbh
2018-11-21 20:41:19	+jan6	about the same as firefox quantum
2018-11-21 20:42:30	+jan6	except lacks a native stylesheet switcher afaik (view -> page style in firefox)
2018-11-21 20:47:05	+aewens	I personally use Firefox Quantum, no regrets.
2018-11-21 20:48:01	+jan6	except for plugins
2018-11-21 20:51:52	+aewens	The plugins I used were already in Firefox Quantum. It does suck though that the transition to using only web extensions broke a bunch of people's stuff though.
2018-11-21 21:00:54	mushmouth|lounge-user	It broke a lot of stuff

2018-11-21 21:52:42	+tomasino	that's how far away the wifi router is, apparently
2018-11-21 21:53:09	+jan6	he means 38% from max, but I too read it kinda like 38% progress, lol
2018-11-21 21:53:19	+tomasino	ahh, yiss
2018-11-21 21:53:35	+aewens	Hmm, I wonder if the range is linear or logarithmic with those percents.
2018-11-21 21:55:35	+tomasino	it's nmcli telling me from a broadcom chip. I suppose we could find docs and find out

2018-11-22 04:15:58	~deepend	I like most genres.. so its all over the place.  just wanted to listen to some music so figured I'd stream while I do that :P
2018-11-22 04:18:16	+tomasino	wish i had the bandwidth to stream
2018-11-22 04:18:22	+tomasino	i could use some random music
2018-11-22 04:18:46	~deepend	I could add a low bandwidth mount point if you like

2018-11-22 04:35:13	hyperboredoubt	Name the domains.

2018-11-22 04:37:03	+tomasino	the gopher ones are being held in trust so they aren't parked
2018-11-22 04:37:09	npa	in trust?
2018-11-22 04:37:17	~deepend	nothing too exciting.. asterius.ca, the-estar.com , rdnetbbs.com, retryhost.com .. just lots of random failed / never started projects lol 
2018-11-22 04:37:19	+tomasino	for whoever wants them, if they're gonna use it
2018-11-22 04:37:43	+tomasino	gopher.studio i may hold onto as a name to work under, company-wise
2018-11-22 04:37:51	npa	its a good name
2018-11-22 04:38:02	+tomasino	gopher.town would make for a great tilde, if someone wants to run it
2018-11-22 04:38:05	+tomasino	hint hint
2018-11-22 04:38:21	~deepend	(could use it for my gopher pages? LMAO 
2018-11-22 04:39:00	~deepend	not that I have many gopher pages unfortunately.. really would like to see gopher really get used.. but though I want to have a nice gopher page I really haven't put the effort forward
2018-11-22 04:39:21	+tomasino	it's fun to hack around in gopher
2018-11-22 04:40:42	hyperboredoubt	Hi, npa.
2018-11-22 04:42:17	+tomasino	if you decide you want a gopher domain, let me know and i'll transfer
2018-11-22 04:46:06	~deepend	hmm.. could create a gopher tilde.. probably not against that idea. :D  
2018-11-22 04:49:21	+tomasino	circumlunar's the only dedicated gopher tilde around atm, i think
2018-11-22 04:49:33	+tomasino	and they're eager to share with others
2018-11-22 04:50:55	~deepend	interesting.. dunno if I have the street cred to pull it off though :P lol
2018-11-22 04:51:50	~deepend	http://circumlunar.space/   is this the place your talking about?

2018-11-22 04:54:53	~deepend	neat.. is it really a tilde.. or just a place offering gopher hosting?

2018-11-22 05:04:02	+tomasino	tildes? there's a lot to offer, yeah
2018-11-22 05:04:32	AndrewBallinger	In that case, I'm going to spend some time rummaging around.
2018-11-22 05:05:15	~deepend	if your just looking for an account on a tilde, you can sign up at any tildes webpage, tilde.team, tilde.town, yourtilde.com
2018-11-22 05:05:16	+tomasino	which tilde did you join?
2018-11-22 05:06:39	+tomasino	eh, midnight

2018-11-22 05:07:02	AndrewBallinger	None of them, I was looking at lobste.rs forks and mistook the chat link on tilde.news as being more specific.
2018-11-22 05:07:36	~deepend	oh okie :)  no worries. 
2018-11-22 05:09:19	~deepend	if your looking for a invite to tilde.news. then someone in here can for sure help if one of the users is on atm :) 
2018-11-22 05:10:39	AndrewBallinger	Why not? :) But, Since I'm here and barged in... Has anyone built a decent self-hosted irc relay yet?
2018-11-22 05:11:57	~deepend	irc network?  this one is hosted by the tildes listed above
2018-11-22 05:12:00	AndrewBallinger	Last time I want down that rabbit hole I came up with a 'no, roll your own', which is fine.
2018-11-22 05:16:24	AndrewBallinger	What client do you use for IRC these days?
2018-11-22 05:16:44	~deepend	using weechat at the moment
2018-11-22 05:18:49	AndrewBallinger	My problem has been that I can't find an IRC client I really liked after meeting Slack and Discord.
2018-11-22 05:19:19	AndrewBallinger	So I find some channel I want to lurk around in, and then I don't. You know?
2018-11-22 05:21:09	~deepend	are you using thelounge right now to connect here right now?
2018-11-22 05:21:34	hyperboredoubt	If you are interested in invented languages, I'm on several Discord servers for that.
2018-11-22 05:22:18	AndrewBallinger	Yep. And... Aren't all languages invented on some level?
2018-11-22 05:23:06	AndrewBallinger	Looks like I'm using someone else's lounge instance, not my own.
2018-11-22 05:23:35	slipyx	its "our" instance
2018-11-22 05:23:41	AndrewBallinger	Thank you.

2018-11-22 05:43:21	AndrewBallinger	I don't know, you tell me. I switched from IRC to Slack for anything serious some years ago... My grandmother can use it.
2018-11-22 05:45:56	hyperboredoubt	I hated Slack.
2018-11-22 05:47:27	fosslinux	slack = sad
2018-11-22 05:47:34	fosslinux	irc is for the elite gamers

2018-11-22 05:48:08	AndrewBallinger	IRC is honestly pretty shit. If it wasn't so bad slack wouldn't have happened.
2018-11-22 05:48:24	fosslinux	why?
2018-11-22 05:49:05	AndrewBallinger	No chat history, no notifications, no way to configure with an email.

2018-11-22 05:50:36	fosslinux	chat history: well yes use a irc bouncer
2018-11-22 05:50:43	AndrewBallinger	That's cute. I kind of prefer "I can communicate effectively".

2018-11-22 05:52:09	fosslinux	beside the point
2018-11-22 05:52:14	AndrewBallinger	I've probably still got a bunch of IRC bouncers somewhere if I could only find them.
2018-11-22 05:52:18	fosslinux	irc is not made for a-tech savvy people
2018-11-22 05:52:36	+jan6|	or run a client on some always-on machine/bouncer
2018-11-22 05:52:48	fosslinux	thats what SMS, Discsord, Slack, Whatapp, social media, instagram are all for
2018-11-22 05:53:45	+jan6|	but open client on a server (weechat @ tilde.team) and thelounge together are pretty cool
2018-11-22 05:54:29	+jan6|	sms is not far from irc tbh, except you already have a client running 24/7
2018-11-22 05:54:42	+jan6|	and it's centralised and stuff
2018-11-22 05:55:03	AndrewBallinger	You forgot E-mail... Which ties the not for the, 'I don't use IRC for anything serious list.'

2018-11-22 19:24:14	+jan6	try telling that to every single EU citizen
2018-11-22 19:25:06	edwardthefma	It will get fixed
2018-11-22 19:25:18	+jan6	it's not that *I* get bloked as much as it is that *EVERYONE* gets blocked, and the big majority won't know to setup a VPN, or which ones work
2018-11-22 19:25:37	+jan6	yeah, "it'll get fixed" is the best we can tell ourselves
2018-11-22 19:25:55	+jan6	if you have any links to the Illuminati, plz urge them to ;)

2018-11-22 19:26:51	+jan6	uk is currently still part of EU afaik, just in the PROCCESS of leaving, or something
2018-11-22 19:28:30	~ben	my statement still holds
2018-11-22 19:31:04	+jan6	the thing is, even if you benefit ALL PARTIES (like copyright holder, viewer, yourself, etc) you STILL get blocked, AND THE PLATFORM SUFFERS

2018-11-22 21:11:14	mushmouth	maybe i should clarify what i mean when i like low resource looking websites or programs. because i just now thought of it the reasoning behind it
2018-11-22 21:11:25	mushmouth	i like stuff which appears and looks old or light weight
2018-11-22 21:11:47	mushmouth	i don't like css which is really crazy
2018-11-22 21:11:51	mushmouth	or appears that way
2018-11-22 21:15:16	hyperboredoubt	Reddit has some subreddits with great CSS though. Check out /r/Ooer.

2018-11-22 21:19:08	+jan6	but otherwise seems nice enough
2018-11-22 21:19:20	epicmorphism	why is suckless still alive
2018-11-22 21:19:28	+jan6	because it's awesome, of course
2018-11-22 21:19:32	+jan6	lol
2018-11-22 21:20:50	epicmorphism	is it?
2018-11-22 21:21:09	+jan6	sure!
2018-11-22 21:21:29	+jan6	farbfeld is so much better than png
2018-11-22 21:21:34	+jan6	for example
2018-11-22 21:21:44	tunas	It's *what*?
2018-11-22 21:22:03	+jan6	it's *BeTteR*
2018-11-22 21:23:07	epicmorphism	oh my god i didnt even know about farbfeld
2018-11-22 21:23:14	hyperboredoubt	What is it?
2018-11-22 21:23:22	+jan6	it's so much easier to parse
2018-11-22 21:23:31	+jan6	basically a nice image format
2018-11-22 21:23:38	tunas	It's literally just raw image data.
2018-11-22 21:23:42	+jan6	kinda
2018-11-22 21:23:55	tunas	Of course raw image data is easy to parse.
2018-11-22 21:23:58	+jan6	it's like an array of it, in a specific format, but yeah
2018-11-22 21:24:07	+jan6	it's basically the size of png too
2018-11-22 21:24:34	tunas	PNG is compressed though...
2018-11-22 21:24:38	+jan6	I mean, png is compressed, and compressed farbfeld is about the same size as unoptimized png
2018-11-22 21:25:03	tunas	I can't even.
2018-11-22 21:25:20	+jan6	using any compression, there's not that much difference of whether you use xz or gzip or whatever
2018-11-22 21:26:33	+jan6	point is it's easy to parse, and as such, good for image filters 'n stuff, and anything that doesn't want an png library dependency, and it's not far from the size
2018-11-22 21:28:15	epicmorphism	anything that's not raw data is not simple^TM

2018-11-23 00:23:02	+tomasino	i'm leaning toward BYOU with the allowance that it's because everything is SOOOOOOO big that it's different where you are from where my ships are
2018-11-23 00:23:15	+tomasino	so it's shared, but your branch of humanity went off differently
2018-11-23 00:23:22	tildebeast	ah, ok.
2018-11-23 00:23:42	+tomasino	we're all held captive by the central idea that interstellar communication is limited to the trickle allowed by the QEC, also
2018-11-23 00:23:48	+tomasino	but if you want alien wars, go for it
2018-11-23 00:24:17	tildebeast	well, i might not bring my own in this case but wouldn't mind thinking of something that works for a shared universe
2018-11-23 00:24:36	+tomasino	you want an account?
2018-11-23 00:24:43	tildebeast	yes please
2018-11-23 00:24:50	+tomasino	i just need to know 3 things:

2018-11-23 00:27:31	~ben	what version is prison edition?
2018-11-23 00:27:45	+tomasino	prison edition has rolling versioning now by commit
2018-11-23 00:27:53	~ben	ahh 
2018-11-23 00:28:03	tildebeast	Stross did that in a couple of his novels. communicators started with a fixed supply of qbits which collapsed as they were used for communication. so ftl comms but not indefinitely :)
2018-11-23 00:28:05	~ben	you should probs update to that deepend
2018-11-23 00:28:24	+tomasino	tildebeast: that'd be a really cool angle if you want to use it
2018-11-23 00:28:30	+tomasino	you're also not limited to a single ship

2018-11-23 00:28:46	+tomasino	I'm going to figure out a way to automate requesting those in the future

2018-11-23 00:29:07	tildebeast	i'll think on it. actually i'd like to do something around a vessel that isn't a colony ship but has to deal with them regularly
2018-11-23 00:29:12	+tomasino	deepend: he's saying the gophernicus version you're using isn't kim's version
2018-11-23 00:29:20	+tomasino	it's probably the prologic backup copy that's super out of date
2018-11-23 00:29:40	~ben	yups
2018-11-23 00:29:42	~deepend	the github one above is 1.6

2018-11-23 00:31:49	~deepend	is there any advantage..?  
2018-11-23 00:32:39	~deepend	mine is kims version.. just from late 2017
2018-11-23 00:32:53	~ben	ahh ok
2018-11-23 00:32:58	~ben	I'm not sure 
2018-11-23 00:33:35	~deepend	well mid 2017 was the archive creation date.  July 2017 to be exact
2018-11-23 00:34:12	~deepend	so probably could compile the slightly newer release.. 
2018-11-23 00:35:12	~ben	ehh
2018-11-23 00:35:23	~ben	at least it's not the prologic version
2018-11-23 00:36:08	~deepend	prologic one is the first one I found but i never got it to compile and run correctly.. so eventually found the version I'm running now and it worked great so stuck with it lol
2018-11-23 00:36:14	+tomasino	there's been some security patching since
2018-11-23 00:36:30	+tomasino	hit /server-status on your server real quick in gopher
2018-11-23 00:36:45	+tomasino	if it shows you all the ip addresses and pages people are viewing, you prolly wanna upgrade
2018-11-23 00:45:18	~ben	yupa

2018-11-23 07:03:25	~ben	so true
2018-11-23 07:04:34	~deepend	edited my ircd config and disabled 6667,  so hopefully that fixes the spam issue :S 
2018-11-23 07:04:37	zyeri	I'm used to flask w/ wtforms, which makes forms stupidly easy
2018-11-23 07:04:44	~ben	deepend: you don't have to disable it
2018-11-23 07:04:48	~ben	just make it localhost only
2018-11-23 07:04:54	~ben	bind to 127.0.0.1 only
2018-11-23 07:05:01	~ben	instead of 0.0.0.0
2018-11-23 07:05:11	fosslinux	flask is good
2018-11-23 07:05:16	fosslinux	i've been looking at it
2018-11-23 07:05:18	~deepend	actually meant to do that.. but I didn't ahve it localhost because i wanted to use it for mirc on my older clients
2018-11-23 07:05:21	zyeri	literally I just write a Python class, instantiate it and pass it to a view and BOOM, it's suddenly a form
2018-11-23 07:05:28	zyeri	<3 flask
2018-11-23 07:05:52	zyeri	flask is one of the few reasons I don't absolutely hate web development

2018-11-23 07:06:36	~ben	it's kinda rails-lite in elixir
2018-11-23 07:07:11	~deepend	ok.. ircd can be accessed from the local tilde on port 6667 lol
2018-11-23 07:08:07	~ben	perfect
2018-11-23 07:13:57	~deepend	now seeing if updating packages will break anything :P 
2018-11-23 07:14:12	~ben	system packages?
2018-11-23 07:14:17	~deepend	yup
2018-11-23 07:14:52	~deepend	took a snapshot prior tho.. so if it breaks something it'd be easy to revert if needed
2018-11-23 07:15:07	~ben	do you not run updates often?
2018-11-23 07:15:19	~ben	i bet i do it at least weekly
2018-11-23 07:15:45	slipyx	im guessing no, since YT is still on kernel 3
2018-11-23 07:15:47	~deepend	depends on how busy I get.  
2018-11-23 07:15:48	 *	slipyx hides

2018-11-23 07:16:03	~deepend	centos always lags behind
2018-11-23 07:16:09	~ben	that's really far behind
2018-11-23 07:16:33	~ben	debian stretch is 4.7 iirc
2018-11-23 07:16:39	~ben	ubunbu bionic is 4.15
2018-11-23 07:16:50	~ben	buster will ship with 4.18 i think
2018-11-23 07:18:23	~ben	"ubunbu"
2018-11-23 07:18:45	dokuja1	uwuntu
2018-11-23 07:18:55	~ben	lol
2018-11-23 07:19:05	~ben	kernel 4.0 was 2015 
2018-11-23 07:21:31	~deepend	is the way centos releases versions.. security patches are what is focused on with centos generally. not feature updates. 
2018-11-23 07:21:59	~ben	huh
2018-11-23 07:22:35	dokuja1	centos is related to RHEL, yes?
2018-11-23 07:22:39	~deepend	yes
2018-11-23 07:22:55	~deepend	is the community version of RHEL
2018-11-23 07:22:56	dokuja1	that makes some sense then
2018-11-23 07:23:15	~deepend	"CentOS is an Enterprise-class operating system and as such is more about stability and long-term support than cutting edge"
2018-11-23 07:23:30	~ben	same could be said for debian stable
2018-11-23 07:23:48	~deepend	probably.  how long is the support cycle for debian ?
2018-11-23 07:25:07	~ben	5 years i think
2018-11-23 07:25:09	~deepend	centos does full 10 year update support cycles.
2018-11-23 07:25:35	~deepend	centos 5 only lost support as of last year
2018-11-23 07:25:56	~ben	10!?
2018-11-23 07:25:58	~ben	damn
2018-11-23 07:26:00	~deepend	yup

2018-11-23 07:26:05	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-11-23 07:26:06	dokuja1	yeah.  sounds like RHEL.  it's a bear to get people to update because of it.
2018-11-23 07:26:13	~deepend	centos 7 is good until 2024
2018-11-23 07:26:19	~ben	how do you get modern packages?
2018-11-23 07:26:40	~ben	stretch is good through 2022
2018-11-23 07:26:50	~deepend	there are places that offer rpms of newer packages.. is how i run php 7+ and such

2018-11-23 16:57:44	+jan6	is there emacs file manager? I don't think so...(tbh I bet there's like 5 different ones, lol)

2018-11-23 16:58:08	cdmnky	i know vim has a file manager, I have to blacklist the histfile in my git settings
2018-11-23 16:58:22	+jan6	nah, I mean, it's a separate package
2018-11-23 16:58:35	+jan6	a full on cool ncurses file manager
2018-11-23 16:58:44	+jan6	you don't even need to know vim to use it
2018-11-23 16:59:04	cdmnky	i just use ranger tbh. it uses vi keys, but works with arrows if you don't know anything about vi
2018-11-23 16:59:14	+jan6	^same with vifm
2018-11-23 16:59:54	+jan6	vifm also allows to preview files and use vim-stuff like visual mode to select multiple files and stuff
2018-11-23 17:00:07	cdmnky	this also has the side effect that no one who wants to borrow my computer knows how my setup works lol
2018-11-23 17:00:16	+jan6	basically "what if vim was a file manager instead of a text editor"

2018-11-23 17:01:10	cdmnky	still, I wish GTK3 would fix their garbled icon bug on i3
2018-11-23 17:01:43	cdmnky	it's as if every time a tray icon changes, it layers on top of the one from before instead of replacing it
2018-11-23 17:02:42	+jan6	lol, seems more like a problem with i3
2018-11-23 17:03:25	cdmnky	I checked the bug tracker, the i3 devs says it's a problem with GTK
2018-11-23 17:05:38	mushmouth	cdmnky: you sure the bug tracker isn't the bug? :P
2018-11-23 17:06:17	cdmnky	I'm looking through some distro forums right now, and I think I found the fix

2018-11-23 18:28:41	cdmnky	well, you missed some flooding yesterday apparently
2018-11-23 18:28:58	cdmnky	and there's a tilde.team channel on freenode in case of outages
2018-11-23 18:29:04	freeappsw	Okay
2018-11-23 18:29:22	freeappsw	So I guess nothing big happened here 
2018-11-23 18:29:41	freeappsw	?
2018-11-23 18:30:09	~ben	heh plenty
2018-11-23 18:30:19	~ben	but i don't remember when you were last here
2018-11-23 18:30:19	freeappsw	What then?
2018-11-23 18:30:26	~ben	lots of new projects, etc
2018-11-23 18:30:44	~ben	we have a new internet radio
2018-11-23 18:30:55	~ben	a search engine
2018-11-23 18:30:59	freeappsw	oh
2018-11-23 18:31:06	freeappsw	Wait search engine?
2018-11-23 18:31:18	cdmnky	the search engine is great, although I can't seem to enable safe search lol
2018-11-23 18:31:20	freeappsw	Is it a fancy frontend for google api?
2018-11-23 18:31:20	~ben	see https://tildeverse.org for a list of all the stuff
2018-11-23 18:31:22	TildeBot	tildeverse

2018-11-23 18:32:15	freeappsw	Wait I have seen that
2018-11-23 18:32:24	~ben	what else
2018-11-23 18:32:26	~ben	hmm
2018-11-23 18:32:32	~ben	tilde.team had an outage for about a day
2018-11-23 18:32:44	freeappsw	Last question
2018-11-23 18:32:48	cdmnky	lol, that was great
2018-11-23 18:32:50	freeappsw	Why kill discord guild?
2018-11-23 18:32:58	~ben	the ip got blocked when the host thought they found an outgoing netscan

2018-11-23 18:33:52	~ben	wasn't worth the administration effort either
2018-11-23 18:34:00	freeappsw	Hmmm
2018-11-23 18:34:04	freeappsw	Wait
2018-11-23 18:34:16	freeappsw	What about tilde private internet accessed over vpn?
2018-11-23 18:34:21	freeappsw	Or something like that?
2018-11-23 18:34:33	~ben	plus it's not open source and kinda goes against the tilde philosophy (for me at least)
2018-11-23 18:34:40	~ben	private internet?
2018-11-23 18:34:55	~ben	i mean we could do something like that pretty easily with ssh port forwards
2018-11-23 18:34:59	freeappsw	Like what cdmnky posted about the tld
2018-11-23 18:35:15	cdmnky	oh that? that was just a meme we were talking about a couple days ago
2018-11-23 18:35:23	~ben	it's not a meme it's real
2018-11-23 18:35:36	freeappsw	So there is some vpn / proxy / whatever that you use to access it
2018-11-23 18:35:39	~ben	no
2018-11-23 18:35:41	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-11-23 18:35:47	freeappsw	And it has some custom tlds 
2018-11-23 18:35:56	~ben	you just set your nameservers to the machine that ubergeek is running bind9 on
2018-11-23 18:36:02	~ben	and you will be able to resolve .tilde domains
2018-11-23 18:36:30	freeappsw	Nameservers of what?
2018-11-23 18:36:36	~ben	what do you mean?
2018-11-23 18:36:41	freeappsw	My DNS servers?
2018-11-23 18:36:43	dokuja1	your devices, presumably
2018-11-23 18:36:46	cdmnky	kinda like TOR and .onions without the strange routing stuff?
2018-11-23 18:36:48	freeappsw	Okay go it
2018-11-23 18:36:53	freeappsw	Got*
2018-11-23 18:37:07	~ben	oh yeah you'd set it on your devices or router etc
2018-11-23 18:39:38	cdmnky	oh god, fallout nv's mouse sensitivity is so high
2018-11-23 18:39:52	cdmnky	even on the lowest settings. this will take some getting used to
2018-11-23 18:40:09	+jan6	13:07:18             mushmouth | i would go up to fallout 4 but not 76

2018-11-23 18:57:06	 *	jan6 would totally like a tilde vpn btw
2018-11-23 18:58:03	+jan6	ssh only allows for a socks5 proxy, or individual sites via port forwarding, one of which doesn't work with 90% of stuff, and other is extremely tedious

2018-11-23 19:27:11	bumbaklat	though you could petition ICANN for the TLD and use RZM to establish a root zone
2018-11-23 19:27:54	bumbaklat	as long as you have authoritative dns at that point with the proper glue, you can have a proper tld root zone + delegated ns
2018-11-23 19:28:33	bumbaklat	so you can have your servers hosts file be server ns1.nic.tilde

2018-11-23 21:54:38	bumbaklat	(for websites, not for daemon hosting)
2018-11-23 21:55:20	Fessus	all I've got is a cheap as shit VPS from NFPhosting. For running simple websites it would be fine though.
2018-11-23 21:55:57	Fessus	honestly I think it has better specs than tilde.town

2018-11-23 22:24:56	Fessus	fine for small sites
2018-11-23 22:27:35	fosslinux	$1 per MONTH???

2018-11-24 02:14:58	%ubergeek	PHP is awesome :)
2018-11-24 02:15:01	%ubergeek	So is Python
2018-11-24 02:15:23	%ubergeek	And Jython (Not really, jython can go die in a fire)
2018-11-24 02:15:35	zyeri	eh, I wouldn't mind PHP if every time I had to use it I was able to use /some/ kind of framework to make life less difficult
2018-11-24 02:16:38	zyeri	like right now, all I really want is a lightweight (MVC-like) framework that lets me avoid mixing PHP and HTML in the same exact file without any kind of separation 
2018-11-24 02:17:35	%ubergeek	Oh, yeah, php probably not the right tool for the job
2018-11-24 02:17:47	zyeri	it usually isn't
2018-11-24 02:17:49	%ubergeek	Ruby is good for that
2018-11-24 02:17:54	zyeri	like, it's great for small one-off things
2018-11-24 02:18:04	%ubergeek	PHP is really just a way to create dynamic HTML pages, imo
2018-11-24 02:18:22	zyeri	but anything larger than a single page or two and it quickly becomes overly complicated
2018-11-24 02:18:39	%ubergeek	eh...  Depends.
2018-11-24 02:18:59	zyeri	and the frameworks I've seen available for it don't seem to help the problem much (they are fairly boilerplate-y, IIRC)
2018-11-24 02:19:48	%ubergeek	Yeah...  It's not really for web-applications, and I think that's where people try to mis-use it.
2018-11-24 02:20:04	%ubergeek	Like this project is pretty simply to examine, and has many pages: https://github.com/szarkos/paradb

2018-11-24 02:20:50	zyeri	PHP not for web applications? wasn't that what it was literally designed for?
2018-11-24 02:21:05	%ubergeek	No
2018-11-24 02:21:06	TildeBot	no u infinity ubergeek
2018-11-24 02:21:24	%ubergeek	It's a Dynamic Preprocessor :)
2018-11-24 02:21:34	%ubergeek	Originally.
2018-11-24 02:22:03	zyeri	:/
2018-11-24 02:22:58	%ubergeek	Basically, it's just to add some dynamic features to pages, but people used it to write very complex web applications, because at first, that and JS was all there was, and JS wasn't all that good.
2018-11-24 02:23:05	%ubergeek	(Because clients were low-powered)
2018-11-24 02:27:57	zyeri	right, and now python, javascript, ruby, etc. all are extremely capable platforms for developing complex web applications but people /still/ use PHP. :/
2018-11-24 02:34:41	%ubergeek	Yeah.  I think it's b/c a) It's what they know, and b) They started out with a simple site, using PHP, and built on that over and over
2018-11-24 02:37:30	zyeri	which is understandable enough, but I've come across too many people (including the instructor for the class this project is for) that use both of those as an excuse to avoid significant amounts of /necessary/ refactoring (or complete rewrites, in some cases)
2018-11-24 02:38:02	zyeri	Using what you know is fine, until it becomes part of the (growing) problem
2018-11-24 02:39:32	zyeri	And too often these people are willing to use ridiculous excuses like "well the business doesn't want to X" and such. And those aren't /necessarily/ bad reasons, until they reach the point where they're being used as justifications for the significant amounts of technical debt that have been allowed to accumulate
2018-11-24 02:41:02	zyeri	at some point, what the business wants should matter /significantly less/ than what the business needs (e.g. a rewrite to eliminate complexity and technical debt resulting in reduced maintenance costs)
2018-11-24 02:45:25	%ubergeek	Sure.  When ROI > costs of implementing the re-write :)

2018-11-24 03:14:24	bumbaklat	also you really wanna be on php 7.0 >=
2018-11-24 03:15:19	bumbaklat	laravel/lumen is powered by Blade (a sort of php dynamic templating engine)

2018-11-24 08:37:41	~ben	it's quite low 
2018-11-24 08:37:57	npa	do you reckon that's linear to the number of users?
2018-11-24 08:38:13	npa	because this is only gonna be me on it
2018-11-24 08:38:21	~ben	oh then it'll be even less
2018-11-24 08:38:26	~ben	postfix scales well
2018-11-24 08:38:36	~ben	i'm less sure about dovecot
2018-11-24 08:39:04	~ben	mostly because i don't see enough concurrent connections to have enough data
2018-11-24 08:42:00	bumbaklat	npa depends on how you auth users
2018-11-24 08:42:16	~ben	03:38 <npa> because this is only gonna be me on it

2018-11-24 16:27:44	+jan6	1 kilobyte == 1000 bytes
2018-11-24 16:28:53	+jan6	the problem is that the kibi and stuff exist for some reason, and everyone gets confuzzled
2018-11-24 16:31:33	midlow	jan6 yeah but like windows makes it so 1 megabyte = 1024kb
2018-11-24 16:31:35	midlow	instead of 1000kb
2018-11-24 16:31:39	midlow	for some reason
2018-11-24 16:37:56	+jan6	it's all a mess
2018-11-24 16:38:42	+jan6	some think it's one way, others believe it to be the opposite, nobody's quite sure why, or why there are two confusingly similar confusing things

2018-11-24 17:42:58	ahriman	or ramnode.com starting at 3usd/mo, tho it's not as powerful as a comparable hetzner vps
2018-11-24 17:44:25	midlow	yearly tho
2018-11-24 17:47:42	 *	ahriman shrugs
2018-11-24 17:47:53	ahriman	hetzner is your best bet
2018-11-24 17:48:23	midlow	its meant to be for a game server
2018-11-24 17:48:35	midlow	so i need good CPU and RAM
2018-11-24 17:48:51	midlow	like 2/3 cores and 1.5GB-ish RAM at least
2018-11-24 17:51:01	midlow	ahriman is this a good deal https://www.woothosting.com/pulse/cart.php?a=add&pid=66

2018-11-24 18:02:33	mushmouth	ahriman: hetzner doesn't like you doing ncat

2018-11-24 18:03:44	ahriman	im cool with that i don't think anyone on my hetzner server will have a valid use for nmap so i dont have it installed
2018-11-24 18:03:46	midlow	i just need something below 15€ eur

2018-11-24 18:58:28	epicmorphism	First introduced by the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs on 20 June 2018, the directive was approved by the European Parliament on 12 September 2018, and is currently passing through formal Trilogue discussions that are expected to conclude in January 2019. If formalised, each of the EU's member countries would then be required to enact laws to support the directive.[3]
2018-11-24 18:58:51	mushmouth	and plus i don't want to link to a alt media news sources
2018-11-24 18:58:57	+jan6	^as I said, around dec-jan is the finalest vote

2018-11-24 19:09:21	midlow	but thats probably impossible
2018-11-24 19:10:28	mushmouth	nah that should link to youtube
2018-11-24 19:10:38	mushmouth	oh and i no longer have tech

2018-11-24 19:23:37	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-11-24 19:26:11	+jan6	basically he wants good server for basically no money at all
2018-11-24 19:26:30	~ben	beggars can't be choosers
2018-11-24 19:26:32	mushmouth	go in the recycle center
2018-11-24 19:26:37	~ben	hetzner is the biggest bang/buck
2018-11-24 19:26:40	mushmouth	find a old computer
2018-11-24 19:26:42	mushmouth	fix it up
2018-11-24 19:26:56	mushmouth	make it a server
2018-11-24 19:27:00	~ben	or that ^^
2018-11-24 19:27:37	+jan6	^
2018-11-24 19:27:58	~deepend	^
2018-11-24 19:28:17	mushmouth	or go to a store which sells computers
2018-11-24 19:28:17	~deepend	felt like I should join in pointing arrows :P 
2018-11-24 19:28:22	+jan6	doesn't have to be old, just something that's always online, therefore probably not your main computer (which you probably update, win10 likes to update very often)
2018-11-24 19:28:23	mushmouth	because they give out stuff for free
2018-11-24 19:28:36	mushmouth	really have to look and not be a lazy dumbass
2018-11-24 19:28:50	~ben	lol yes that
2018-11-24 19:29:13	+jan6	old computers are fine for non-game servers tbh, not exactly sure how fit they are for 3d game servers
2018-11-24 19:29:44	~deepend	depends on how the game utilizes the server itself 
2018-11-24 19:30:17	+jan6	but I imagine it'd run fine for a couple of people(about 3-5 I assume? idk), if it's from the last 3-5 years
2018-11-24 19:31:47	+jan6	also I've heard of some ISPs blocking you from hosting stuff yourself, unless you ask them to, but idk if it's happening anymore
2018-11-24 19:32:01	midlow	my ISP doesnt disallow it i think
2018-11-24 19:32:16	midlow	also im p. much broke thats why i wanna do the container shit
2018-11-24 19:32:25	~deepend	guarantee they mention not allowed to run servers in the terms... but most dont enforce it
2018-11-24 19:32:52	+jan6	"guarantee they mention not allowed to run servers in the terms" I certainly wouldn't
2018-11-24 19:33:12	mushmouth	jan6: only if they get pissy
2018-11-24 19:33:18	mushmouth	but beside that they usually are fine
2018-11-24 19:33:23	mushmouth	given midlow 0 users it probably okay
2018-11-24 19:33:27	~deepend	isp o
2018-11-24 19:33:28	+jan6	seems to be a US thing to block home servers by default and stuff, imo
2018-11-24 19:33:39	midlow	but ben, can you help with the container thing so i can set up the server
2018-11-24 19:34:13	~deepend	isp i'm with doesn't allow servers on personal connections but allows on business. the last ISP i was with was big on just blocking ports (which is why I'm not with them anymore)
2018-11-24 19:34:15	midlow	it wont use much bandwith but the thing it's that it's around 6 or 7GB of diskspace
2018-11-24 19:35:19	~deepend	what kind of server you trying to run midlow ?
2018-11-24 19:35:23	midlow	g-mod
2018-11-24 19:35:40	~ben	you still haven't asked what you needed
2018-11-24 19:35:44	~ben	just for general help
2018-11-24 19:35:44	~deepend	explain like I"m dumb.. cuz dont know what g-mod is?
2018-11-24 19:35:52	+jan6	a game
2018-11-24 19:35:55	~ben	which port
2018-11-24 19:35:58	midlow	it's basically a sandbox game where you can write your own gamemodes, weapons, addons etc in lua
2018-11-24 19:36:01	midlow	is 27015 taken?
2018-11-24 19:36:20	mushmouth	ben: it could run on any
2018-11-24 19:36:31	mushmouth	but given it the game default port\
2018-11-24 19:36:33	+jan6	I guess the easiest is to have midlow.tilde.team be redirected to the lxd
2018-11-24 19:36:34	midlow	yeah it can run on any but 27015 is default portr
2018-11-24 19:36:34	mushmouth	he should look that up
2018-11-24 19:36:38	~ben	no and i already added a firewall exception for it since the last time you asked
2018-11-24 19:36:39	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-11-24 19:36:56	midlow	so yeah 27015
2018-11-24 19:37:10	+jan6	^he said he did it already
2018-11-24 19:37:13	midlow	huh
2018-11-24 19:37:17	midlow	let me check then hold up
2018-11-24 19:37:31	midlow	ill set up the gmod server
2018-11-24 19:37:42	midlow	how much space do i have ben
2018-11-24 19:38:03	~ben	all lxd containers share a 40gb storage pool
2018-11-24 19:38:13	midlow	alright that's more than enough good
2018-11-24 19:38:33	midlow	im only gonna be using 10gb tops, probably like 7.5gb
2018-11-24 19:38:57	midlow	and since i have no friends i wont be using any bandwidth so i wont be a problem
2018-11-24 19:40:19	~ben	that's sharing between 10 containers
2018-11-24 19:41:00	midlow	wait didnt i have to do "ssh vps" to get into my container

2018-11-24 19:52:53	~ben	same port
2018-11-24 19:53:11	midlow	i did netcat -l 27015 and it says the port is already in use 🤔

2018-11-24 20:00:43	midlow	this popped up when installing the dependencies btw
2018-11-24 20:01:20	~deepend	arrow up to no configuration and tab to ok and press enter? D
2018-11-24 20:01:29	~ben	what are you installing postfix for?
2018-11-24 20:01:34	midlow	idk its in the dependencies
2018-11-24 20:01:45	midlow	i guess the server needs it?
2018-11-24 20:01:48	midlow	i just chose no configuration

2018-11-24 20:03:12	midlow	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-11-24 20:04:43	+jan6	probably for something along the lines of "mail when server crashes" and stuff
2018-11-24 20:04:59	midlow	probably. i just set it to no configuration, whatever
2018-11-24 20:08:57	midlow	jan6 huh, the weird trhing is that it doesn't check if postfix is installed when running the script
2018-11-24 20:09:02	midlow	it lists as a dependency in the webpage though
2018-11-24 20:09:05	midlow	i guess it's optional?
2018-11-24 20:09:44	+jan6	dependencies aren't
2018-11-24 20:09:46	~ben	weird
2018-11-24 20:09:56	+jan6	but how'd you know it doesn't check?
2018-11-24 20:10:10	midlow	ben just saying what's the actual ip? to connect to the server
2018-11-24 20:10:18	~ben	dig +short a tilde.team
2018-11-24 20:10:26	~ben	why do you need the ip anyways
2018-11-24 20:10:27	midlow	so it's just tilde team'sd efault ip?
2018-11-24 20:10:30	~ben	dns exists for a reason
2018-11-24 20:10:31	midlow	gmod uses IP not domains
2018-11-24 20:10:33	midlow	or dns
2018-11-24 20:10:37	midlow	because its gay and from 2004
2018-11-24 20:10:39	+jan6	domains work afaik?
2018-11-24 20:10:48	~ben	i mean everything uses ip
2018-11-24 20:10:50	midlow	in the server browser it's just IPs
2018-11-24 20:10:56	midlow	it doesn't care about dns
2018-11-24 20:11:05	~ben	dns just tells you the ip of a domain name
2018-11-24 20:11:06	+jan6	have you TRIED to use a domain?
2018-11-24 20:11:12	+jan6	^
2018-11-24 20:11:15	~ben	or looked it up yourself?
2018-11-24 20:11:23	midlow	you can connect to a domain but all commands to check what server you're in returns the IP instead of the domain
2018-11-24 20:11:35	~ben	195.201.242.48
2018-11-24 20:11:36	midlow	that's why i asked for the ip, because nobody actually uses domain to connect to servers since in the end it just turns to IP
2018-11-24 20:11:38	midlow	alright thanks father
2018-11-24 20:11:44	+jan6	so why'd you need the IP if you can use domain?
2018-11-24 20:11:48	~ben	srsly tho
2018-11-24 20:11:51	+jan6	^
2018-11-24 20:11:56	~ben	you can look it up yourself anyways
2018-11-24 20:12:31	+jan6	if you CAN use midlow.ttm.sh then why WOULD you use 195.201.242.48 instead?
2018-11-24 20:13:07	midlow	idk
2018-11-24 20:13:11	midlow	nobody actually uses domains in gmod
2018-11-24 20:13:36	midlow	also just wondering what are the specs
2018-11-24 20:14:23	+jan6	...
2018-11-24 20:14:37	+jan6	google, "how to check cpu linux"

2018-11-24 20:45:06	midlow	oh fuck
2018-11-24 20:45:18	midlow	-strictportbind isnt the problem, i dont think so
2018-11-24 20:45:23	+jan6	it IS
2018-11-24 20:45:23	midlow	that just changes the port to an unused one
2018-11-24 20:45:25	midlow	but i want to use 27015
2018-11-24 20:45:35	+jan6	quitting due to "-strictportbind" command-line flag!
2018-11-24 20:45:46	midlow	yes, because if -strictportbind isn't on it'd just start the server on 27016
2018-11-24 20:45:48	midlow	or 27014
2018-11-24 20:45:59	midlow	-strictportbind just restarts/quits the server if the port isn't available
2018-11-24 20:46:33	midlow	"If you launch the game with this option it will quit with an error message if it can't bind to the default or specified port."
2018-11-24 20:46:41	+jan6	k
2018-11-24 20:47:02	midlow	so wat do
2018-11-24 20:47:04	midlow	port 27015 is unavailable
2018-11-24 20:47:37	+jan6	cry in the corner? try to find out what's using it by asking google "what's using my port linux" or somthing?

2018-11-24 20:52:08	midlow	oh, it's cut off
2018-11-24 20:52:10	midlow	srcds_linux
2018-11-24 20:52:12	midlow	that's the gmod server
2018-11-24 20:52:15	midlow	what??
2018-11-24 20:53:00	midlow	the server's closed right now though, wtf. i'll try to kill that PID
2018-11-24 20:53:00	+jan6	that's running and keeping the port for itself
2018-11-24 20:53:41	midlow	don't see it anymore, i think i killed it. let me try running the server again
2018-11-24 20:54:01	midlow	yep. thanks man
2018-11-24 20:54:38	midlow	although there's a problem. connecting to 195.201.242.48:27015 says it can't connect ingame
2018-11-24 20:54:53	midlow	i'm checking server console and it's up (and i can send commands to it)
2018-11-24 20:54:57	midlow	so i think there's a problem with the forwarding
2018-11-24 21:01:24	+jan6	it sure should work, but yeah
2018-11-24 21:01:40	midlow	maybe he forwarded it tcp
2018-11-24 21:01:46	midlow	instead of udp
2018-11-24 21:02:24	+jan6	well, it IS being forwarded
2018-11-24 21:02:49	+jan6	27015/tcp open  unknown
2018-11-24 21:02:52	midlow	tcp.
2018-11-24 21:02:53	+jan6	27014/tcp filtered unknown
2018-11-24 21:02:54	midlow	there's the problem
2018-11-24 21:03:00	midlow	it should be open on udp not tcp
2018-11-24 21:03:52	midlow	who do i ask to fix this, since bеns not here
2018-11-24 21:04:26	+jan6	15:50 <midlow> tcp        0      0 milo.lxd:27015          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      789/./srcd   
2018-11-24 21:04:45	+jan6	what you forgot is it wants BOTH udp and tcp
2018-11-24 21:05:00	midlow	oh yeah, i think the game also uses tcp for some weird other reason
2018-11-24 21:05:28	midlow	but it should be forwarded on udp since that's the actual game's protocol
2018-11-24 21:05:40	midlow	it uses tcp for a different part of the game
2018-11-24 21:06:05	midlow	is udp not forwarded though? only tcp?
2018-11-24 21:06:09	+jan6	27015/udp closed halflife
2018-11-24 21:06:15	+jan6	weird stuffs
2018-11-24 21:06:21	midlow	right. yeah that was my half life server that i asked bеn for
2018-11-24 21:06:32	midlow	uses same port as gmod tho
2018-11-24 21:06:37	midlow	why is the forward closed though, and who do i ask to open it
2018-11-24 21:06:45	+jan6	whoever
2018-11-24 21:06:47	+jan6	I quit
2018-11-24 21:06:59	midlow	s
2018-11-24 21:07:06	+jan6	it IS 11 at night here, after all
2018-11-24 21:07:10	midlow	10 here
2018-11-24 21:07:25	midlow	but like who should i ask. should i ask deep
2018-11-24 21:08:30	+jan6	b€n and kħuxkm are the admins, idk about others
2018-11-24 21:09:22	midlow	khuxkm hey fam can you help me out here with forwarding from my lxd
2018-11-24 21:09:41	midlow	port 27015 on UDP is closed and i need it open for my gameserver
2018-11-24 21:10:43	+jan6	*hides under a desk and braces for a "this is sparta" kick when khux gets on, if he even does today*

2018-11-25 02:57:50	TildeBot	Nintendo 64 technical specifications - Wikipedia https://bhh.sh/23s

2018-11-25 03:01:55	mushmouth	so yeah we got their trailer license as well as the truck
2018-11-25 03:02:08	mushmouth	they were pulled in a store not to far away

2018-11-25 03:03:42	mushmouth	im tempted. if my machine has a pentium 4. do you think it'll run like 95 or 98 well?
2018-11-25 03:03:59	mushmouth	like how hard would it be to find drivers for it?
2018-11-25 03:04:36	Naglfar	it's awsome ben, there's a bottom bar in screen, some like the one on tmux
2018-11-25 03:04:50	mushmouth	Naglfar: i like byobu one better
2018-11-25 03:05:02	mushmouth	i run it on my vultr vps. it has 243d uptime
2018-11-25 03:05:35	~ben	what's awesome?
2018-11-25 03:05:37	Naglfar	mushmouth have you ever run this game ? https://frogatto.com/
2018-11-25 03:05:38	TildeBot	 Frogatto &amp; Friends 
2018-11-25 03:06:07	mushmouth	Naglfar: no but it looks cool
2018-11-25 03:06:15	mushmouth	does it support windows xp?
2018-11-25 03:06:28	Naglfar	windows ?
2018-11-25 03:06:28	mushmouth	reminds me of cave story
2018-11-25 03:06:46	mushmouth	yeah like an older windows
2018-11-25 03:06:46	~ben	delet windowz
2018-11-25 03:07:11	mushmouth	oh it only seems to support mac and black berry
2018-11-25 03:07:14	Naglfar	mushmouth, run windows inside quemu instead
2018-11-25 03:07:27	mushmouth	Naglfar: these are vintage machines
2018-11-25 03:07:34	mushmouth	i hate vms
2018-11-25 03:07:42	~ben	what's wrong with VMs
2018-11-25 03:07:49	~ben	qemu is gr8
2018-11-25 03:08:01	mushmouth	just doesn't seem like you can produce it all that well. and i like the real hardware experience
2018-11-25 03:08:20	@khuxkm|lounge	qemu is slow, esp. on Raspberry Pi :(
2018-11-25 03:08:44	~ben	yeah i mean there's not much that's going to be fast on a pi
2018-11-25 03:08:50	zyeri	^
2018-11-25 03:09:09	@khuxkm|lounge	but, like, even on ARM64
2018-11-25 03:09:10	~ben	qemu is reasonably fast
2018-11-25 03:09:13	~ben	for most cases
2018-11-25 03:09:29	mushmouth	it fun to mess around with like say templeos,plan9 and more obsecure os's
2018-11-25 03:09:29	@khuxkm|lounge	I wish the Raspberry Pi could run Windows apps on Wine but it's a different architecture
2018-11-25 03:09:44	@khuxkm|lounge	which sucks since my favorite GameBoy emulator is Windows-only
2018-11-25 03:09:44	mushmouth	but usually i want to run it on hardware
2018-11-25 03:09:59	~ben	i never understood the reason to run it on hardware
2018-11-25 03:10:00	zyeri	I actually emulated a raspberry pi zero on an i5-4200U process before; wasn't /super/ fast but it was usable enough
2018-11-25 03:10:06	~ben	but more power to ya
2018-11-25 03:10:12	mushmouth	ben: it's hard to explain honestly
2018-11-25 03:10:25	zyeri	didn't know qemu could emulate other architectures before that, was interesting to discover
2018-11-25 03:10:27	~ben	it's your time and money 
2018-11-25 03:10:36	~ben	zyeri: one process?
2018-11-25 03:10:45	mushmouth	zyeri: yup can pretty much run all. so long as os suppots it
2018-11-25 03:11:19	zyeri	ben: uh I don't remember, it was over a year ago and I'm a tiny bit drunk right now so my brain doesn't want to work anyway
2018-11-25 03:11:27	mushmouth	seen people run android x86 on it
2018-11-25 03:11:28	TildeBot	I don't know who people is.
2018-11-25 03:11:33	~ben	lol nice ;)
2018-11-25 03:11:34	zyeri	TildeBot: you're people!
2018-11-25 03:11:36	TildeBot	zyeri: Might find some fun stuff, heard of people finding entire working computers thrown out cause people got tired of their films are better, but forgot i'm portblocked.

2018-11-25 03:15:22	zyeri	also note to self: opening bottles of wine while drunk is way harder than it needs to be
2018-11-25 03:15:41	~ben	wine is gr8
2018-11-25 03:15:45	~ben	but so is beere

2018-11-25 03:16:39	zyeri	never actually had beer, so I suppose I don't know what I'm missing?
2018-11-25 03:16:48	mushmouth	i can never do beer
2018-11-25 03:16:52	mushmouth	only the harder stuff
2018-11-25 03:16:57	mushmouth	like skotch or whiskey

2018-11-25 03:17:10	zyeri	mushmouth: same, but I'm guessing for different reasons?
2018-11-25 03:17:16	~ben	there are so many kinds of beer
2018-11-25 03:17:17	mushmouth	zyeri: im irish and scottish

2018-11-25 03:17:26	~ben	what does that have to do with beer
2018-11-25 03:17:34	mushmouth	ben: scotch and wishkey
2018-11-25 03:17:38	zyeri	can't do /all/ beer

2018-11-25 03:19:13	zyeri	what you /don't/ get used to, however, is this 51s ping on irc. D:
2018-11-25 03:19:29	zyeri	oh I can get stuff like pasta, it's just a bit more expensive
2018-11-25 03:19:38	~ben	51 second?

2018-11-25 03:20:11	zyeri	aaand its gone now
2018-11-25 03:20:23	~ben	there's probably one geographically closer
2018-11-25 03:20:38	zyeri	it was probably the digitalocean droplet I'm running znc on
2018-11-25 03:20:40	~ben	unless you're using chat on one of the tildeverse shell boxes
2018-11-25 03:20:44	mushmouth	ben: do we need a europe node if we get a lot of users?
2018-11-25 03:20:51	~ben	~team is there

2018-11-25 03:21:41	zyeri	I'm having trouble deciphering what TildeBot is saying; is that intentional or should I hold back on the wine a bit? D:
2018-11-25 03:21:42	TildeBot	zyeri, Yeah, if you want to keep your private life private, i am. D.
2018-11-25 03:21:53	zyeri	wat

2018-11-25 03:28:41	~ben	owo what's this
2018-11-25 03:34:08	@khuxkm|lounge	ended up settling for khuxkm.geek
2018-11-25 03:34:18	~ben	uber.geek when
2018-11-25 03:34:25	@khuxkm|lounge	gonna forward it to my LXD container once the zone propagates
2018-11-25 03:34:47	~ben	heh nice
2018-11-25 03:35:43	@khuxkm|lounge	what should I have set the ttl to?
2018-11-25 03:35:49	@khuxkm|lounge	i set it to 100, is that too high?
2018-11-25 03:36:23	ubergeek|lounge	100 secs should be fine, if maybe a bit low
2018-11-25 03:36:37	~ben	i tend to shoot for lower ttl's
2018-11-25 03:36:42	@khuxkm|lounge	how long does zone propagation usually take?
2018-11-25 03:36:47	slipyx	show me them ttls
2018-11-25 03:36:48	~ben	where lower is 300 seconds 
2018-11-25 03:36:58	~ben	or auto on the dns settings
2018-11-25 03:37:18	@khuxkm|lounge	it doesn't let me choose auto (unless auto = leave TTL box blank
2018-11-25 03:37:43	~ben	doesn't really matter too much
2018-11-25 03:37:52	~ben	first propagation isn't the question
2018-11-25 03:37:59	~ben	that's for changes after the fact
2018-11-25 03:38:55	Naglfar	OS: FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE/amd64 - CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2660 v2 @ (2200.08 MHz K) - Processes: 83 - Uptime: 24d 15h 2m - Load Average: 0.56 - Memory Usage: 135.24MB/1245.60MB (10.86%) - Disk Usage: 3.77GB/14.53GB (25.97%)
2018-11-25 03:39:12	@khuxkm|lounge	so subdomains have to be set in nginx, right? I'm just gonna set up geek.khuxkm.nand.sh if that's the case (same as khuxkm.geek but without OpenNIC requirement)
2018-11-25 03:39:23	zyeri	> E5-2660
2018-11-25 03:39:26	zyeri	that's a lot of cores!
2018-11-25 03:39:34	slipyx	sign me up
2018-11-25 03:39:50	~ben	Naglfar: what?
2018-11-25 03:40:01	~ben	khuxkm|lounge: there's no dns for *.khuxkm.nand.sh
2018-11-25 03:40:17	~ben	i can add a dns record for that if you like
2018-11-25 03:40:19	@khuxkm|lounge	?
2018-11-25 03:40:21	Naglfar	ben, that's sysinfo for irssi, running on bsd.tilde.team
2018-11-25 03:40:29	@khuxkm|lounge	I did test.khuxkm.nand.sh and it went to nand.sh
2018-11-25 03:40:38	Naglfar	ben, can I create a #bsd for *bsd users ?
2018-11-25 03:40:58	~ben	you can make any channel you want
2018-11-25 03:41:28	~ben	khuxkm|lounge: i thought you just registered khuxkm.geke
2018-11-25 03:42:19	@khuxkm|lounge	no, I'm saying that in the meantime, while I wait for khuxkm.geek to propogate I'll use geek.khuxkm.nand.sh to set up the required configs on my container
2018-11-25 03:42:28	@khuxkm|lounge	but, yes, khuxkm.geek is now mine
2018-11-25 03:42:35	@khuxkm|lounge	registered via be.libre
2018-11-25 03:42:41	~ben	should probably be propagated by now
2018-11-25 03:42:59	~ben	but yeah if it resolves, go ahead and add it to your nginx config
2018-11-25 03:43:09	~ben	there isn't a cert for *.khuxkm.nand.sh though
2018-11-25 03:43:52	@khuxkm|lounge	it's still coming up NXDOMAIN
2018-11-25 03:44:22	@khuxkm|lounge	gonna try adding an OpenNIC "official" server in my area, see if it's just not recursing right through the .tilde DNS
2018-11-25 03:44:32	~ben	ok
2018-11-25 03:44:54	+tomasino	hey ben, i'm thinking i should add cosmic.voyage to tilde lists
2018-11-25 03:45:05	ubergeek|lounge	If it's not recursing through the .tilde servers, let me know what servers you are using, and I'll look into it
2018-11-25 03:45:06	~ben	ok!
2018-11-25 03:45:11	+tomasino	where do those live? wiki's pulling from git somewhere?

2018-11-25 03:53:19	~ben	we can add that
2018-11-25 03:53:28	~ben	.tilde resolvers or?
2018-11-25 03:53:57	@khuxkm	I mean, any DNS setting that resolves .tilde SHOULD resolve any other opennic
2018-11-25 03:54:58	~ben	ok i'll add it

2018-11-25 04:00:28	+tomasino	at the very least, it's a stress-free opportunity to write something without having to start from scratch
2018-11-25 04:00:44	+tomasino	you can mimic others and follow along, which makes stuff a little easier than staring at a blank page
2018-11-25 04:01:15	+tomasino	speaking of which, a new message just arrived at RS001!
2018-11-25 04:02:35	+tomasino	khuxkm: shoot me an email at tomasino@lavabit.com with your username for the server, first ship's name, and an ssh pubkey

2018-11-25 04:11:41	@khuxkm|lounge	Space Cruiser is more of a designation, it'll be used in the sending logs :P
2018-11-25 04:12:31	+tomasino	welcome to the voyage!

2018-11-25 06:54:59	fosslinux	is there a formula for the colours?
2018-11-25 06:55:44	naglfar	sorry for leave and join, just trying some znc settings

2018-11-25 06:56:27	fosslinux	oh ok
2018-11-25 06:56:29	fosslinux	that makes sense
2018-11-25 06:57:00	~ben	heh who needs znc when you have weechat/irssi in byobu/tmux/screen
2018-11-25 06:57:09	~ben	unless you have multiple desktop clients that you use

2018-11-25 07:07:32	fosslinux	when i press alt, it goes to the {file,edit,...} selection menyu
2018-11-25 07:07:35	fosslinux	so you can use the keyboard
2018-11-25 07:08:05	fosslinux	like alt-f does file

2018-11-25 07:13:47	fosslinux	i think i tried that

2018-11-25 07:13:53	<--	naglfar (naglfar@bsd.tilde.team) has left #meta

2018-11-25 07:17:30	~ben	just do dig +short a ssh.tilde.team and grab it from there
2018-11-25 07:18:04	fosslinux	what to get the ip?
2018-11-25 07:18:22	~ben	ye
2018-11-25 07:23:31	Naglfar	is it possible to edit /usr/local/etc/screenrc or overridden it?
2018-11-25 07:27:08	~deepend	there.. now my dns servers pass opendns tier 1 test.. not that it overly mattered  lol  
2018-11-25 07:31:19	ahriman	congangsterlations deepend
2018-11-25 07:32:28	~deepend	and added an atlanta server to the list :D 
2018-11-25 07:33:54	ahriman	hell yes
2018-11-25 07:34:18	~deepend	so now the .tilde dns network has servers in Franfurt, Quebec, Seattle and Atlanta
2018-11-25 07:37:31	ahriman	word, nice distribution
2018-11-25 07:38:04	ahriman	atlanta, via ramnode?
2018-11-25 07:38:09	~deepend	vultr
2018-11-25 07:38:14	ahriman	oh cool
2018-11-25 07:38:39	ahriman	i cant wait till we can start setting up services with .tilde
2018-11-25 07:38:50	~deepend	seattle and atlanta are vultr.  quebec is ovh
2018-11-25 07:39:02	ahriman	frankfurt = hetzner?
2018-11-25 07:39:25	~deepend	not sure.. cant remember where ubergeek said he has that
2018-11-25 07:39:30	ahriman	word
2018-11-25 07:39:48	~deepend	i run the quebec, seattle and atlanta servers
2018-11-25 07:40:25	ahriman	hetzner has a DC in finland if youre going for wide distribution
2018-11-25 07:40:35	~deepend	and the dns seems to work well.. I use it on my network at home without trouble
2018-11-25 07:41:03	~deepend	not sure on exact target areas.. guess it'll depend on how many users/where users are located.
2018-11-25 07:41:11	ahriman	word
2018-11-25 07:43:36	~ben	Naglfar: wouldn't ~/.screenrc override that normally?
2018-11-25 07:43:43	~ben	i can make a change for you if you like
2018-11-25 07:43:45	Naglfar	ben, yes I just done it
2018-11-25 07:43:57	~deepend	didn't you goto bed ben? :D
2018-11-25 07:44:05	~ben	i went upstairs to my bed
2018-11-25 07:44:07	~ben	lol
2018-11-25 07:44:08	Naglfar	thank you ben 
2018-11-25 07:44:09	~ben	does that count
2018-11-25 07:44:10	~deepend	lol
2018-11-25 07:44:15	~deepend	possibly.. 
2018-11-25 07:45:07	~deepend	so what was the decision on hostnames for dns servers.. was there a decision made on that?  forgot to ask ubergeek when he was still around
2018-11-25 07:45:36	~ben	it was either nsX.tildeverse.org or nsX.tildenet.org
2018-11-25 07:45:41	~ben	either one is find
2018-11-25 07:45:43	~ben	s/d/e
2018-11-25 07:45:43	sedbot	<ben> either one is fine
2018-11-25 07:46:21	~deepend	i got the configs available on git make the dns servers pass the opennic tier 1 test. 
2018-11-25 07:46:53	~deepend	i said opendns above but my fingers dont listen to my brain apparently :P 
2018-11-25 07:47:45	~ben	ok got the dns resolver working on ~team
2018-11-25 07:48:05	~deepend	http://report.opennicproject.org/t2log/t1.php?ip_addr=66.42.77.29
2018-11-25 07:48:09	~deepend	here is one of my servers
2018-11-25 07:48:11	~ben	what did you have to do to get it to work with tier 1?
2018-11-25 07:48:31	~deepend	query port randomization. was the main thing
2018-11-25 07:48:45	~ben	i thought dns was port 53
2018-11-25 07:49:34	~deepend	yes.. but to avoid certain types of attacks the dns server has to randomize the udp port used
2018-11-25 07:50:38	~deepend	so my config has ports between 3000-8000.. still could offer more ports to get a higher rating but a good rating is good enough for me
2018-11-25 07:51:51	~ben	oh the udp port
2018-11-25 07:51:52	~ben	huh 
2018-11-25 07:51:53	~deepend	port 53 is the port dns initiates communication on but after that it switches to a random port.. 
2018-11-25 07:52:22	~deepend	unless you tell it to not to.
2018-11-25 07:52:51	~ben	right
2018-11-25 07:53:45	~deepend	originally when I set mine up I like to have tight firewall settings.. so to function i had to restrict it to port 53.. but once I figured out the config settings to specify the port range used I added the ports to my firewall
2018-11-25 07:54:19	~ben	ahhh ok i see
2018-11-25 07:55:28	~deepend	is nice to have dns that gives me opennic domains as well as .tilde :P
2018-11-25 07:55:49	~deepend	eventually I will take advantage of .tilde.. right now nothing really is setup for that domain
2018-11-25 07:56:22	~ben	i guess i'll have to set up a vhost for team.tilde
2018-11-25 07:56:38	~deepend	same.. but i'm lazy :P 
2018-11-25 07:56:43	~ben	lol yeah
2018-11-25 07:57:13	~ben	plus my nginx config for the ~team site is huuuuge

2018-11-25 07:57:41	~deepend	ouch
2018-11-25 07:58:05	~ben	i wonder if i could get letsencrypt to give out a cert for .tilde domains
2018-11-25 07:58:06	~deepend	i've kept mine messy but small :P 
2018-11-25 07:58:18	~ben	lots of duplicated stuff for user domain nonsense
2018-11-25 07:58:23	~deepend	probably not. I would be shocked if you got it to
2018-11-25 07:58:45	~ben	$user.domain.tld, domain.tld/~$user, and domain.tld/u/$user
2018-11-25 07:59:58	~deepend	how hard you think it'd be to make a website so someone could add/manage a .tilde domain?

2018-11-25 09:16:08	+jan6	probably not too hard, if you assume people to not try breaking it
2018-11-25 09:16:38	~deepend	guess that is also something to think about.. :D  someone is always trying to break things unfortunately :S
2018-11-25 09:16:56	+jan6	something like a php script that writes a template file, then uses a form to fill in the blanks
2018-11-25 09:19:39	bumbaklat	not hard with the right data validation
2018-11-25 09:24:12	~deepend	probably something that'll have to be solved in the not to distant future.. assuming people would be more likely to use this dns service if the domains could be easily created and managed :D 
2018-11-25 09:26:30	bumbaklat	it can
2018-11-25 09:27:05	bumbaklat	poweradmin and powerdns at the core with gmysql/mariadb-galera backend, unbound for public recursion
2018-11-25 09:34:03	~deepend	poweradmin hasn't hardly had any updates in 2 years and an actual release since 2014.. I think that wouldn't be a good idea.  appreciate the idea though
2018-11-25 09:35:17	~deepend	but anyways I'm heading to bed.. is 2:30am here :)  night everyone
2018-11-25 09:48:47	bumbaklat	it's handling 40k+ zones quite nicely
2018-11-25 09:49:19	bumbaklat	just gotta completely configure/stresstest/pentest
2018-11-25 09:50:30	bumbaklat	and if you can, establish IX linkage with cloudflare, and get cloudflare vdns to [ai]xfr slave your master ns
2018-11-25 09:51:03	bumbaklat	unbound is a different beast
2018-11-25 09:51:13	bumbaklat	quite fkn awesome i might add
2018-11-25 10:24:44	midlow	noooo
2018-11-25 10:24:57	midlow	im fucking late now bén is doing the sleps

2018-11-25 10:35:01	midlow	and i have no idea how to do the portforward shit
2018-11-25 10:35:51	midlow	like right i make a ssh tunnel but wtf am i meant to do
2018-11-25 10:36:32	npa	whaddya setting up midlow?
2018-11-25 10:37:04	midlow	i'm trying to set up a gmod server on a lxd container but like i don't get what i'm supposed to do to be able to connect to it through tilde.team's ip
2018-11-25 10:38:48	midlow	"lxd (at least as currently intended) will not do host networking."
2018-11-25 10:38:57	npa	you'll need to set up iptables to forward traffic
2018-11-25 10:39:25	npa	i set up mail to be in a container and needed to forward 110,143,5887,993,995
2018-11-25 10:40:28	npa	command was something like this: `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 995 -j DNAT --to-destination $serverip:995`
2018-11-25 10:40:30	npa	etc
2018-11-25 10:40:37	npa	but you'll need to make them persistent
2018-11-25 10:40:43	npa	+ need sudo
2018-11-25 10:40:48	midlow	yeah i have no idea i suck at computer shit
2018-11-25 10:40:54	midlow	i do have sudo on my lxd container
2018-11-25 10:41:03	npa	this is on the host, you'll need to do
2018-11-25 10:41:22	midlow	i suck at this shit
2018-11-25 10:41:27	midlow	now i remember why i gave up
2018-11-25 10:41:30	npa	annoying thing is hetzner doesn't allow ip scanning so its hard to verify its working, but just point nc at it
2018-11-25 10:42:14	midlow	i still have no idea what i have to do im dumb
2018-11-25 10:42:38	midlow	shits complicated
2018-11-25 10:43:22	npa	yeah its pretty complicated
2018-11-25 10:43:29	midlow	ok can u like explain like im 5 because i've used linux like 0.1 times in my life
2018-11-25 10:43:40	npa	i'll try and draw a diagram
2018-11-25 10:43:48	midlow	i want tilde.team's ip (on port 27015) udp and tcp traffic to go to my lxd container on tilde
2018-11-25 10:43:56	midlow	or however it works
2018-11-25 10:44:10	npa	ok that's easy
2018-11-25 10:44:13	midlow	yeah
2018-11-25 10:44:20	npa	but you'll need sudo on ~team
2018-11-25 10:44:21	midlow	so you can connect to my gameserver through tilde
2018-11-25 10:44:22	midlow	oh
2018-11-25 10:44:26	npa	i think(?)
2018-11-25 10:44:37	midlow	i think port 27015 is open in ~team
2018-11-25 10:44:39	midlow	but TCP only
2018-11-25 10:44:39	npa	1 sec, lemme try
2018-11-25 10:47:54	npa	hmm, yeah iptables (which is what does the forwarding in a nice way in linux land) requires sudo
2018-11-25 10:48:03	midlow	ouch
2018-11-25 10:48:07	npa	even for ports >1024 (which you don't need sudo to open)
2018-11-25 10:48:40	npa	you cooould make some hacky solution, where you write a program to ferry the requests over, but that's probably gonna be buggy
2018-11-25 10:50:22	npa	oh sick, there's a way to do it without touching iptables using lxc

2018-11-25 10:50:37	midlow	yeah, that's where i checked
2018-11-25 10:50:46	midlow	just to make sure, the "host" means ~team right
2018-11-25 10:50:53	npa	yep
2018-11-25 10:51:06	npa	and guest means the lxc container
2018-11-25 10:51:15	midlow	so bén/a sudoer would have to run the command on ~team? or do you not need sudo for that
2018-11-25 10:51:19	midlow	🤔
2018-11-25 10:51:30	npa	lxc tools requires sudo unfortunately
2018-11-25 10:51:35	midlow	ouch
2018-11-25 10:51:53	midlow	khux is probably awake but im too scared to ping him

2018-11-25 11:34:26	+jan6	they don't allow scanning THEIR net, fine with scanning a single port
2018-11-25 11:35:44	+jan6	basically don't scan 10.* IPs, or anyone that might complain to them
2018-11-25 11:36:12	+jan6	nmap -sU -p 27015 tilde.team
2018-11-25 11:36:17	+jan6	nmap -p 27015 tilde.team
2018-11-25 11:36:41	+jan6	should scan for udp and tcp respectively, on ONLY that port on ONLY team's ip
2018-11-25 11:40:34	npa	good to know, cheers jan6
2018-11-25 11:41:56	npa	plus I guess if you have control over the VPS (not really in this case), you can just run sudo netstat -plunt | grep PROCESSNUM

2018-11-25 12:40:42	mushmouth	it a systemd utility for networking
2018-11-25 12:40:55	+jan6	it's the evil networking thing in ubuntu
2018-11-25 12:41:35	+jan6	it's unintuitive and bad
2018-11-25 12:41:45	mushmouth	the config file is disgusting
2018-11-25 12:41:50	mushmouth	gives me aids
2018-11-25 12:42:54	severak	network config is bit of black magic for me
2018-11-25 12:43:08	+jan6	used to just say "interface eth0 statuc \n netmask n stuff"? well screw you, we'll make a systemd network manager that uses basically json and you HAVE to add a /whatever network size, so if you want a single ip, you better remember that netmask!
2018-11-25 12:43:23	+jan6	it's so bad...
2018-11-25 12:43:58	mushmouth	even worse then that. you have to edit a shitty yaml file and picky dns settings
2018-11-25 12:44:07	mushmouth	just for dns
2018-11-25 12:44:14	 *	severak used to: IP address conflict? Go and restart all the stuff.
2018-11-25 12:45:04	+jan6	lol
2018-11-25 12:45:20	mushmouth	like you have to apparently tab or ident things in an order
2018-11-25 12:45:35	mushmouth	like who the fuck thought of this thing and why did they hate themselfs so much?
2018-11-25 12:49:12	+jan6	https://ttm.sh/bh.txt
2018-11-25 12:49:35	mushmouth	^
2018-11-25 12:50:29	+jan6	you might not even need all the fields for ifupdown, I just took like the first examples for both I got from a search on "how to set static ip with X"
2018-11-25 12:52:14	+jan6	kill -9 netplan
2018-11-25 12:53:03	+jan6	Why Netplan
2018-11-25 12:53:04	+jan6	Using netplan gives a central location to describe simple to complex networking configurations that function from Desktop to Server and from Cloud to IoT. Specifically, for systems with networkd, this relieves the user from having to configure up to three different files per device or configuration.
2018-11-25 12:53:53	mushmouth	it gives me more pain then relieve
2018-11-25 12:53:55	+jan6	*it can save you from editing UP TO THREE different files*
2018-11-25 12:54:45	+jan6	so no matter if you want to edit dns, ip, or whatever-the-third-file-is-for, you gotta use OUR thing now
2018-11-25 12:55:10	mushmouth	which is largely worse then networkmanger
2018-11-25 12:56:05	+jan6	To determine the current DNS servers used by the system run systemd-resolve --status and look for the ‘DNS Servers:’ entry to see what DNS server is used.
2018-11-25 12:56:10	+jan6	oof
2018-11-25 12:56:33	+jan6	this is really making me consider whether to go systemd-less
2018-11-25 12:56:56	+jan6	it really IS trying to become gnu+systemd/linux
2018-11-25 12:57:04	mushmouth	yup
2018-11-25 12:57:32	+jan6	systemd-ls and systemd-texteditor when?
2018-11-25 12:57:50	mushmouth	systemd kernel?
2018-11-25 12:57:51	+jan6	systemd-kernel by 2030
2018-11-25 12:57:54	mushmouth	lol
2018-11-25 12:58:10	+jan6	at that pace, might very well happen
2018-11-25 12:58:45	mushmouth	systemd firmware
2018-11-25 12:58:48	mushmouth	systemd libc
2018-11-25 12:59:23	+jan6	"this enables you to confugure kernel parameters at runtime using a tab-formatted file on the bootloader partition"
2018-11-25 13:00:12	+jan6	"which is hidden, but just run systemd-unlock-kernl-yes-I-love-you-very-much"
2018-11-25 13:00:31	+jan6	libc? nah, systemd IS the library
2018-11-25 13:00:36	+jan6	;P
2018-11-25 13:01:01	+jan6	lib-systemd
2018-11-25 13:02:06	+jan6	bonus feature is that you can control every program with systemd, no matter if you want it or not
2018-11-25 13:03:33	+jan6	At install time, a user can opt to use ifupdown by preseeding netcfg/do_not_use_netplan=true. This is done by adding the preseed line to the command line when booting the installation media (i.e. at install media boot menu, press F6, type ‘e’, and add to the command line).
2018-11-25 13:04:13	+jan6	at least they give an option, "if you really seriously don't want our nice and fancy thing, then we'll allow you to say so before installing it"
2018-11-25 13:08:16	mushmouth	jan6: there even a community for without systemd

2018-11-25 19:01:27	+jan6	pfft, I bought some random "puzzle collection" and I don't recall CDs being in paper envelopes...AND normal cd cases at the same time...it's not like there's a manual or part 2 cd or anything, just instead of plopping it in the case, they put an envelope instead?
2018-11-25 19:01:42	mushmouth	you probably have sent more to me deepend

2018-11-25 19:07:33	~deepend	nothing wrong with winxp or vista.. :P

2018-11-25 19:11:02	mushmouth	wondering if there a fix for that?
2018-11-25 19:11:26	~deepend	should be able to.. it'll show the edit window are the bottom of the paste 
2018-11-25 19:11:54	mushmouth	im dumb
2018-11-25 19:12:00	mushmouth	i didn't think to scroll back that much
2018-11-25 19:12:21	~deepend	took me a minute to figure it out the first time as well.. not very intuitive 
2018-11-25 19:12:34	mushmouth	you would think it would be at the top
2018-11-25 19:12:40	mushmouth	with an edit button
2018-11-25 19:12:44	~deepend	or just be an edit button
2018-11-25 19:13:18	+jan6	Ubisoft Puzzler...back when they did more than just sequels
2018-11-25 19:15:55	mushmouth	deepend: is there an admin or config option for that?
2018-11-25 19:16:33	~deepend	to add an edit button?  nope  its lacking alot of admin features.. and some dont even work.. or I Would have renamed the site to something yourtilde related
2018-11-25 19:17:23	mushmouth	that just sucks
2018-11-25 19:17:41	mushmouth	by the way deepend have you touched ubuntu 18.04 yet?
2018-11-25 19:17:49	mushmouth	netplan is a pain in the ass
2018-11-25 19:18:47	~deepend	touched.. a bit.. i try to not use it.. netplan is part of the reason I wont touch it.. and converting back to the old way is also a pain
2018-11-25 19:23:35	+jan6	just replace it
2018-11-25 19:23:43	~deepend	stupid paste site.. apparently I dont know my admin password for it lol
2018-11-25 19:24:01	~deepend	or just dont run anything that uses netplan :P  
2018-11-25 19:24:30	+jan6	netplan site says a way to not install netplan, by setting a kernel option in the installer boot screen or something, "or you can just install ifupdown manually and use it as normal"
2018-11-25 19:25:31	~deepend	yup.  or just run an os that doesn't have netplan. less steps :D  
2018-11-25 19:25:39	+jan6	^
2018-11-25 19:25:56	+jan6	debian is fine enough ATM, so I keep using it
2018-11-25 19:26:24	+jan6	I'll probably keep using it as long as they don't do any of the stupid sheit ubuntu does
2018-11-25 19:26:28	~deepend	i stick to centos.  I use ubuntu for a few systems but not many
2018-11-25 19:26:43	+jan6	ubuntu is good for servers and stuff, not much else
2018-11-25 19:27:07	~deepend	i dont like it on servers either. but thats just me.  servers are the only place I'd ever run ubuntu tho
2018-11-25 19:27:16	+jan6	^kinda same
2018-11-25 19:28:08	+jan6	except I have to run a ubuntu vm to get my ID card soft to work, which allows to give digital signatures and sign in to banks and stuff
2018-11-25 19:28:32	~deepend	centos is great.. they may stay lagging in versions of packages but it keeps things the same.. no major changes between releases
2018-11-25 19:29:32	+jan6	ubuntu server's kinda like that too
2018-11-25 19:29:39	+jan6	except, y'know, netplan
2018-11-25 19:30:29	~deepend	dont know why they use netplan.. is there anyone that actually likes it?
2018-11-25 19:31:16	~deepend	to me.. its ubuntu solving a problem that was never there to begin with
2018-11-25 19:31:42	+jan6	in this case, 100% agreed
2018-11-25 19:31:58	+jan6	ifupdown mḿight be old, but it WORKS and it works WELL
2018-11-25 19:32:23	~deepend	is very old.. but its never really shown its age in my opinion
2018-11-25 19:32:27	+jan6	^
2018-11-25 19:33:05	+jan6	kinda like vim/emacs and bash and stuff
2018-11-25 19:44:10	~deepend	cant say I enjoy vim/emacs.. but I like bash alot :P  
2018-11-25 19:49:51	fosslinux	what do you use then
2018-11-25 19:49:56	fosslinux	for your text editor?
2018-11-25 20:03:02	+jan6	nano ;P
2018-11-25 20:05:18	~tomasino	:'(
2018-11-25 20:18:08	fosslinux	^
2018-11-25 20:18:15	fosslinux	i use vim ftw
2018-11-25 20:27:44	+jan6	2 cmplx 4 me
2018-11-25 20:27:51	+jan6	need to learn it sometime
2018-11-25 20:29:57	ahriman	vim is so nice
2018-11-25 20:30:15	~deepend	nano is what i use.. vi if i need to
2018-11-25 20:30:20	ahriman	especially with syntax highliting and stuff
2018-11-25 20:30:40	~tomasino	vim is my everything
2018-11-25 20:31:35	+jan6	same, deepend 
2018-11-25 20:31:48	~deepend	my familiy is my everything.. nano is just my text editor lol
2018-11-25 20:32:21	+jan6	vifm is a cool thing tbh, basically vi equivalent for file managing, ncurses and everything
2018-11-25 20:32:43	+jan6	I mean a sparate program not the one builtin to vim, btw
2018-11-25 20:32:49	ahriman	i use ranger for a file manager
2018-11-25 20:33:26	~deepend	i used to use mc.. but haven't used it in years
2018-11-25 20:34:00	ahriman	although 90% of the time i don't use ranger at all and just navigate straight from the command line, so i rarely actually open ranger
2018-11-25 20:34:11	+jan6	minecraft or midnight commander? :p
2018-11-25 20:34:30	~deepend	midnight commander
2018-11-25 20:34:57	~tomasino	my family are pretty good, but vim!!! ;)
2018-11-25 20:35:05	~deepend	:D

2018-11-25 20:39:08	amcclure[team]	Would anyone be interested in contributing or donating to thunix?
2018-11-25 20:41:17	~deepend	what you needing amcclure[team] ?  do you have the whole old server or you just recreating thunix?
2018-11-25 20:41:17	 *	jan6 contributes attention
2018-11-25 20:41:28	+jan6	thunx-ix
2018-11-25 20:41:49	amcclure[team]	recreating it
2018-11-25 20:42:26	~deepend	so you just have the domain or something and recreating the rest? 
2018-11-25 20:42:32	amcclure[team]	I did however save almost all important files besides /home/* content
2018-11-25 20:44:05	amcclure[team]	is ben online?
2018-11-25 20:45:05	~tomasino	pentatonix suck. that is all
2018-11-25 20:45:07	~deepend	no idea. what are you looking for as far as contributing?  running services like these isn't exactly the cheapest thing.. even tho for a start up you could do well on a cheap vps
2018-11-25 20:45:08	TildeBot	no u infinity deepend
2018-11-25 20:45:47	amcclure[team]	any recommendations for an affordable vps?
2018-11-25 20:45:53	+jan6	15:45:05             ~tomasino | pentatonix suck. that is all
2018-11-25 20:45:55	+jan6	why?
2018-11-25 20:46:15	+jan6	pentatonix daft punk mashup is cool
2018-11-25 20:46:23	~deepend	depends on what you concider affordable..?
2018-11-25 20:46:54	amcclure[team]	deepend: what do you use for your server?
2018-11-25 20:47:26	~deepend	i have a Dedicated server from soyoustart.com (which is OVH)
2018-11-25 20:47:44	amcclure[team]	thanks
2018-11-25 20:47:47	+jan6	can't go wrong with starting with hetzner ;P
2018-11-25 20:48:09	~deepend	https://turnkeyinternet.net/cloud-hosted-virtual-servers-vps/   there is a decent VPS for 9.99 per month , 4 cores, 4GB ram.. only lacking in storage.. but for a start it isn't bad
2018-11-25 20:48:12	TildeBot	Cloud Hosted Servers - Virtual Servers (VPS) - Raid-10 SSD, Gigabit Bandwidth https://bhh.sh/247
2018-11-25 20:48:52	~deepend	or
2018-11-25 20:49:18	~deepend	kimsufi.com has a dedicated server running an atom cpu 4GB ram, 2TB hard drive for 11.99 per month
2018-11-25 20:50:35	~deepend	which is also OVH
2018-11-25 20:50:36	+jan6	https://www.hetzner.com/cloud the clouds are pretty nice deals imo
2018-11-25 20:50:37	TildeBot	Truly thrifty cloud hosting - Hetzner Online GmbH 
2018-11-25 20:51:10	+jan6	CX11
2018-11-25 20:51:11	~deepend	the OVH deal is a better deal then the cloud servers at hetzner.
2018-11-25 20:51:12	+jan6	€ 2.49
2018-11-25 20:51:14	+jan6	monthly
2018-11-25 20:51:16	+jan6	€ 0.004 / h

2018-11-25 20:51:42	~deepend	/s/OVH/kimsufi
2018-11-25 20:51:44	+jan6	possibly
2018-11-25 20:52:32	~deepend	mostly because your not disk space bound like you are as much on the 11.99 server at kimsufi.com.. and this is 11.99 CDN
2018-11-25 20:52:43	~deepend	not sure what it is in US dollars
2018-11-25 20:52:51	+jan6	CX21 has 2vCPU, 4.90€ monthly, 4G ram, 40G disk, 20G traffic, tho
2018-11-25 20:52:53	+jan6	so not sure
2018-11-25 20:53:01	~deepend	9.99IS
2018-11-25 20:53:03	~deepend	US
2018-11-25 20:54:14	~deepend	the CX21 is like 5.56US.. at kimsufi your getting a completely dedicated system with a 2TB drive for not much more
2018-11-25 20:55:00	~deepend	the kimsufi system is 2core/4thread
2018-11-25 20:55:16	amcclure[team]	so kimsufi would be better?
2018-11-25 20:55:39	amcclure[team]	which ks-# would you recommend
2018-11-25 20:55:41	~deepend	i would think so. less worry about disk space
2018-11-25 20:56:04	+jan6	but what about the net?
2018-11-25 20:56:15	amcclure[team]	the net?
2018-11-25 20:56:32	+jan6	how much traffic can you afford?
2018-11-25 20:56:48	amcclure[team]	we could always expand if needed though
2018-11-25 21:00:58	~deepend	what about the net?
2018-11-25 21:01:43	amcclure[team]	what about the net?
2018-11-25 21:02:26	+jan6	what about the net?
2018-11-25 21:03:58	~deepend	not sure on what the question is? LOL 
2018-11-25 21:04:28	amcclure[team]	jan6, ^
2018-11-25 21:04:40	+jan6	^

2018-11-25 21:04:48	+jan6	^
2018-11-25 21:05:43	~deepend	or for 20.99 per month you could do a 2x240GB SSD on a Xeon 4core/8thread machine with 16GB ram. 
2018-11-25 21:09:40	amcclure[team]	we could always expand if we need

2018-11-25 21:47:00	%ubergeek	Is there an aversion to self-hosting thunix?

2018-11-25 21:52:33	%ubergeek	Really, any ISO can become a tilde
2018-11-25 21:52:36	bumbaklat	not to mention not compiling in bluetooth stack support, and conveniently not compiling vulnerable netfilter modules etc..
2018-11-25 21:53:08	bumbaklat	w^x is nice for that, haven't really tried STS on obsd before
2018-11-25 21:53:59	bumbaklat	at one point i had a completely custom firewall with portknocking, based on pf

2018-11-25 22:32:11	~khuxkm	yes
2018-11-25 22:32:24	~khuxkm	free shell use on this scale is unsustainable

2018-11-25 22:32:43	%ubergeek	It's causing internet climate change
2018-11-25 22:32:45	~khuxkm	as such, free tildes will cease January 1st, 2019
2018-11-25 22:32:52	+jan6	no, 2020

2018-11-25 22:33:58	+jan6	you meant Tilde & Co. right?

2018-11-25 23:27:31	%ubergeek	Depends on the application.  I prefer apache for applications, nginx for static content and for app redirects

2018-11-25 23:27:56	sedbot	<ubergeek> Depends on the application.  I prefer apache for applications, nginx for static content and for forward proxies

2018-11-25 23:29:12	~deepend	i can see why you'd prefer nginx for forward proxies.  the config is easier for those configurations
2018-11-25 23:29:37	brendantcc_lounge	fosslinux wanted to use nginx, and he installed it
2018-11-25 23:29:46	zyeri	deepend: nginx config is always easier than the xml-like nonsense apache has
2018-11-25 23:29:48	%ubergeek	nginx configs are in /etc/nginx

2018-11-25 23:30:45	zyeri	xml is bad and people who use it should (and probably do) feel bad
2018-11-25 23:30:45	%ubergeek	So why did you ask?
2018-11-25 23:30:50	~deepend	Guess that depends on the person.. I have more experience with apache.. therefore that makes apache easier for me.. and i'm lazy so not wanting to learn something new at the moment :P
2018-11-25 23:31:17	%ubergeek	apache has .htaccess files...  Which makes it a very good server for some applications.
2018-11-25 23:31:29	~tomasino	yeah, apache is easy by default of experience for me as well. I also dig shared hosting environments and nginx SUCKS when you need to do .htaccess style things on a site-by-site basis
2018-11-25 23:31:53	~tomasino	but for production hosts, nginx is growing on me. It's lean & mean
2018-11-25 23:31:54	%ubergeek	... or even dir by dir...
2018-11-25 23:32:17	brendantcc_lounge	ubergeek: i was asking where in the nginx.conf file i can find out where nginx is getting the home index.html file

2018-11-25 23:37:15	~tomasino	honestly, i don't pay much attention to jamestomasino.com. It's there when i'm job hunting just to be there. 
2018-11-25 23:37:16	zyeri	nope
2018-11-25 23:37:17	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-25 23:37:33	zyeri	it's a CORS error
2018-11-25 23:37:41	~tomasino	ahh, interesting
2018-11-25 23:37:56	~tomasino	probably why i'm not noticing it
2018-11-25 23:37:59	~tomasino	firefox not yelling
2018-11-25 23:38:18	~tomasino	meh. maybe i'll get around to fixing it, or just pull in a different hugo theme

2018-11-25 23:38:46	zyeri	nice site though

2018-11-25 23:39:32	~tomasino	it looks like fontawesome has a new CDN that fixed it
2018-11-25 23:39:39	brendantcc_lounge	👌👌
2018-11-25 23:39:40	~tomasino	i'll just have to change the pathing in the theme
2018-11-25 23:39:58	brendantcc_lounge	i pulled up the site in iexplore (RIP ME) and it worked fine
2018-11-25 23:40:04	brendantcc_lounge	didnt bother to look @ console
2018-11-25 23:40:09	zyeri	okay why the actual hell is weechat showing emoji
2018-11-25 23:40:27	%ubergeek	Your terminal supports it, zyeri 
2018-11-25 23:40:32	zyeri	bah
2018-11-25 23:40:38	%ubergeek	It's just a unicode character, after all
2018-11-25 23:40:39	 *	zyeri gets a better terminal
2018-11-25 23:40:58	zyeri	ah there we go, back to square boxes

2018-11-25 23:42:28	~tomasino	huh, just added a CORS header to that site. Anything working now, zyeri?
2018-11-25 23:43:16	zyeri	yeah

2018-11-25 23:43:28	~tomasino	huh, lame
2018-11-25 23:43:31	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-25 23:43:34	~tomasino	well thanks for pointing it out
2018-11-25 23:44:23	bumbaklat	anyone got shell scripts to organize music folder
2018-11-25 23:44:26	~tomasino	i mean, i understand a server saying "all you other people aren't allowed to load my stuff cross domain" but to have the server say itself, "I'm not allowed" makes no sense. I can just change it
2018-11-25 23:44:53	~tomasino	bumbaklat: id3 tagging and renaming? i used to do that on windows, sadly. ID3TagIt

2018-11-25 23:45:59	bumbaklat	dood
2018-11-25 23:46:03	zyeri	biggest feature it has is tagging tracks against the musicbrainz database
2018-11-25 23:46:28	bumbaklat	does it remove dupes?
2018-11-25 23:46:45	zyeri	uh, I think it can detect them? but I'm not sure

2018-11-25 23:46:54	zyeri	never had to clean out dupes from my library

2018-11-25 23:54:49	%ubergeek	I know they were particular about who they granted accounts to
2018-11-25 23:55:06	%ubergeek	I think what you do could make a good case for it, which is why I mentioned it
2018-11-25 23:55:32	~tomasino	possibly!
2018-11-25 23:55:37	~tomasino	i want to do "more"
2018-11-25 23:55:43	~tomasino	but i'm never sure exactly what
2018-11-25 23:56:08	~tomasino	i ran a tor relay for a long time... i'm doing some gopher stuff... i dunno

2018-11-25 23:56:45	%ubergeek	I only knew about the gopher stuff
2018-11-25 23:57:01	%ubergeek	and I thought you were working on SSL gopher, right?
2018-11-25 23:57:21	%ubergeek	(or, TLS, rather, as I know someone will jump down my throat for that)
2018-11-25 23:57:27	~tomasino	working on that. I do gopher over tor already
2018-11-25 23:57:43	~tomasino	tor was easy!

2018-11-26 00:01:02	~tomasino	maybe i can figure out a good way to harden and protect some gophery goodness, anonymize it, and serve it over tor and give people access to it in areas that need secret messaging outbound
2018-11-26 00:01:35	~tomasino	hmmm... that's worth exploring

2018-11-26 01:20:25	~ben	what's wrong with radiobot?
2018-11-26 01:20:27	~ben	:(
2018-11-26 01:20:36	~khuxkm	it needs IRC events, like pings
2018-11-26 01:20:52	~khuxkm	I guess it's not that radiobot sucks, it's that this one will be even better
2018-11-26 01:20:56	~ben	oh yeah it do
2018-11-26 01:21:02	~khuxkm	this one checks every second for a change
2018-11-26 01:21:03	~ben	inotify is probably the way to go
2018-11-26 01:21:05	~khuxkm	(NYI)
2018-11-26 01:21:15	~ben	then you don't have to poll it manually
2018-11-26 01:21:22	~khuxkm	oh well
2018-11-26 01:21:27	~ben	i just couldn't figure out a way to have two separate event loops going
2018-11-26 01:21:35	~ben	wasn't worth it imo
2018-11-26 01:21:40	~ben	but if you have a better way, great!

2018-11-26 01:29:42	mushmouth	tomasino: i might ask you for gopher help on my server
2018-11-26 01:29:49	mushmouth	i can't seem to get the gophermap to work properly
2018-11-26 01:29:55	~ben	yeah, same
2018-11-26 01:30:02	~ben	grabbed groceries on the way into town
2018-11-26 01:30:15	~tomasino	sure thing mushmouth 
2018-11-26 01:30:15	~ben	mushmouth: which gopherd?
2018-11-26 01:30:20	mushmouth	pygopherd
2018-11-26 01:30:25	~ben	ah i'm not familiar
2018-11-26 01:30:41	mushmouth	the gopher shouldn't matter though?
2018-11-26 01:30:43	~ben	i've had good luck with gophernicus and i know tomasino likes motsognir
2018-11-26 01:30:47	~tomasino	okay, it's more strict than gophernicus, but not as strict as motsognir
2018-11-26 01:30:53	~ben	they all have slightly different gophermap specs

2018-11-26 01:31:21	~tomasino	if you build for motsognir, it'll work anywhere. that's why i use it as my main. If it works for me it'll work on all the mirrors
2018-11-26 01:31:27	~tomasino	but it is REALLY strict
2018-11-26 01:31:45	mushmouth	i have a ubuntu as my main server os?
2018-11-26 01:31:57	~tomasino	that won't affect anything. you'll be good
2018-11-26 01:31:59	~ben	that's fine
2018-11-26 01:32:04	~tomasino	any reason you aren't using gophernicus, though?
2018-11-26 01:32:08	~tomasino	it's kinda the easiest
2018-11-26 01:32:12	mushmouth	i thought pygopherd would be easier
2018-11-26 01:32:17	~tomasino	ahh, gotcha
2018-11-26 01:32:27	mushmouth	can i query you tom?
2018-11-26 01:32:28	~tomasino	pygopherd was the first one i ever set up
2018-11-26 01:32:30	~tomasino	sure!
2018-11-26 01:32:32	~tomasino	query away
2018-11-26 01:33:26	~ben	gophernicus was easier 4 me 
2018-11-26 01:34:21	~ben	but it should be doable either way
2018-11-26 01:34:25	~tomasino	yeah, kim did a great job making it almost automatic
2018-11-26 01:34:30	~ben	yup!

2018-11-26 14:09:06	mushmouth	hey ben
2018-11-26 14:09:30	mushmouth	i have a question since im not a audio guy
2018-11-26 14:09:38	mushmouth	what speakers reasonable priced are worth getting?
2018-11-26 14:11:28	mushmouth	like usb or audio cable
2018-11-26 14:11:57	mushmouth	i have logitech right now and they aren't the best
2018-11-26 14:13:32	snurryboy	hey
2018-11-26 14:15:18	~ben	logitech usually has some decent ones
2018-11-26 14:15:45	mushmouth	there like really cheap ones
2018-11-26 14:15:54	mushmouth	like barely spent 100 on it
2018-11-26 14:15:55	cdmnky	I should get a 3.5mm to 5mm audio adapter so I can hook my PC audio up to my guitar amp
2018-11-26 14:16:42	cdmnky	that tiny thing is really nice. I got it as a gift, broken, from a thrift sale somewhere and my dad fixed it
2018-11-26 14:17:08	cdmnky	all that was wrong was a severed input wire that needed to be resoldered
2018-11-26 14:17:31	mushmouth	i would like something with a little more oof to it?
2018-11-26 14:17:37	mushmouth	feels just like raw audio
2018-11-26 14:17:56	mushmouth	if raw even makes sense here
2018-11-26 14:18:46	cdmnky	perhaps a dolby 5.1 surround setup or whatever they call it
2018-11-26 14:22:25	mushmouth	i know this may be weird. but i like calling gopher sites gopherholes
2018-11-26 14:26:14	cdmnky	hey ben how late did you manage to stay up last night? I got like 3.5 hours of sleep lol
2018-11-26 14:29:59	~ben	it sounds pretty standard to me to call gopher sites gopherholes
2018-11-26 14:30:02	~ben	cdmnky: 3
2018-11-26 14:30:08	~ben	got up at 8:30
2018-11-26 14:30:22	~ben	made it to work at 9
2018-11-26 14:30:52	cdmnky	oof, I got to bed at 1-ish and had to wake up at 5
2018-11-26 14:32:00	mushmouth	ben: it makes more sense then like oh it's my gopher page
2018-11-26 14:32:09	~ben	rips
2018-11-26 14:32:22	~ben	that's early
2018-11-26 14:32:48	cdmnky	at least I could get a coffee at mcd's on the way to school
2018-11-26 14:33:24	cdmnky	the best time to go to mcdonalds is before 6:30 when they don't have anything cooked
2018-11-26 14:33:26	~ben	heh nice
2018-11-26 14:33:28	mushmouth	cdmnky: it seems like a dolby 5.1 surround sound would cost a lot
2018-11-26 14:33:34	mushmouth	do you know the price on those things?
2018-11-26 14:33:41	~ben	i just made a cup in the keurig when i was in the shower
2018-11-26 14:33:59	~ben	what price range are you looking for?
2018-11-26 14:34:28	~tomasino	i just made an aeropress cup
2018-11-26 14:34:53	~ben	uwu that's even fancier
2018-11-26 14:34:55	cdmnky	5.1 is the cheapest, 7.1 is like a movie theater and 9.1 is "front height channels add a new dimension", although I'm pretty sure most mobos only support 5.1 at the most
2018-11-26 14:35:11	cdmnky	my mobo's cheap, only stereo and mic hookups
2018-11-26 14:35:40	~ben	if it's computer speakers, i wouldn't bother with 5.1
2018-11-26 14:35:42	~ben	2.1 is plenty

2018-11-26 19:30:27	bumbaklat	or take lvm snapshot
2018-11-26 19:30:36	bumbaklat	(if you use lvm)
2018-11-26 19:31:31	bumbaklat	if you use tarsnap lmk i have scripts for that
2018-11-26 19:32:21	+jan6	do it, bumba
2018-11-26 19:32:37	+jan6	ben has no idea how to retrieve a SINGLE folder out of the tarsnap backup
2018-11-26 19:33:07	bumbaklat	i mean out of a .tar (not .tar.gz)
2018-11-26 19:33:10	bumbaklat	you can extract by path
2018-11-26 19:33:28	+jan6	from that, sure
2018-11-26 19:33:34	bumbaklat	like tar -xzvpf backup.tar path/to/extract/
2018-11-26 19:33:47	bumbaklat	without the -z i guess
2018-11-26 19:34:00	+jan6	-z for .gz I guess
2018-11-26 19:34:09	bumbaklat	yeah but then it has to uncompress
2018-11-26 19:34:30	+jan6	who uses tar without compression anyway!?
2018-11-26 19:34:38	+jan6	cpio > tar ;3
2018-11-26 19:34:39	bumbaklat	people who extract by directory
2018-11-26 19:34:50	bumbaklat	who doesn't just use rsync for remote backups
2018-11-26 19:35:12	+jan6	would you prefer a 500gb or a 200 gb backup?
2018-11-26 19:35:17	+jan6	of the same thing?
2018-11-26 19:35:25	bumbaklat	depends if you're incremental
2018-11-26 19:36:03	bumbaklat	then rsnapshot is more useful
2018-11-26 19:36:38	bumbaklat	anyone that's used rsnapshot also likely knows python lol
2018-11-26 19:36:48	%ubergeek	Are we just missing thelounge accounts?
2018-11-26 19:37:22	%ubergeek	if so, (me) personally, would just announce that "they are gone, and you need to go re-set it up.  My bad, enjoy the free service"
2018-11-26 19:37:35	%ubergeek	jm2c, however
2018-11-26 19:38:38	+jan6	^^
2018-11-26 19:38:48	+jan6	it's not a big deal tbh
2018-11-26 19:38:58	+jan6	all you lose is scrollback, basically
2018-11-26 19:39:01	midlow	hey guys i need a really lightweight linux distro JUST for a luarocks script
2018-11-26 19:39:12	midlow	is alpine good
2018-11-26 19:39:15	+jan6	maybe
2018-11-26 19:39:21	midlow	i guess ill do alpin e
2018-11-26 19:39:37	+jan6	if you want a REAL barebones, then tinycore is also a thing
2018-11-26 19:40:16	+jan6	11mb for the minimal install
2018-11-26 19:40:17	midlow	its just for luarocks
2018-11-26 19:40:25	cdmnky	wait, ben what if the config jsons were copied over to the bsd server?
2018-11-26 19:40:30	midlow	some script that creates steam accounts
2018-11-26 19:40:32	midlow	thats it
2018-11-26 19:40:44	midlow	i just dont wanna install luarocks on my pc cuz i dont wanna mess up my PATH even more
2018-11-26 19:41:03	bumbaklat	gentoo
2018-11-26 19:41:10	cdmnky	Or, at least use it to inflate the home dir backup and copy over the files
2018-11-26 19:41:13	bumbaklat	"If you didn't install it, it's not there."
2018-11-26 19:41:29	+jan6	chroot, or lxd or stuff, dood
2018-11-26 19:41:37	+jan6	also why not mess with PATH?
2018-11-26 19:41:44	midlow	it's too messed up already
2018-11-26 19:41:51	+jan6	pff
2018-11-26 19:41:52	bumbaklat	just symlink your bins from a shared $PATH
2018-11-26 19:41:54	midlow	so i wanna do it in a VM
2018-11-26 19:42:02	+jan6	^what bumba said
2018-11-26 19:42:09	midlow	yeah that sounded like technobabble to me

2018-11-26 19:42:34	bumbaklat	export PATH=$PATH:~/tools
2018-11-26 19:42:38	bumbaklat	ah
2018-11-26 19:42:40	bumbaklat	there's your problem
2018-11-26 19:42:42	midlow	thats why making a linux vm
2018-11-26 19:42:46	midlow	for this purpose
2018-11-26 19:42:56	+jan6	oooor you could use something like cygwin or stuff
2018-11-26 19:43:06	bumbaklat	might work in WSL
2018-11-26 19:43:08	midlow	still would mess up my PATH tho
2018-11-26 19:43:11	midlow	i just wanna do it in an isolated vm
2018-11-26 19:43:17	+jan6	then do it
2018-11-26 19:43:22	midlow	yes thats what
2018-11-26 19:43:24	midlow	thats what im doing
2018-11-26 19:43:26	~khuxkm	also account creation is broken

2018-11-26 23:33:17	~deepend	hey sebboh 
2018-11-26 23:34:10	mushmouth	hey deepend 
2018-11-26 23:34:15	mushmouth	by the way did you read yourtilde?
2018-11-26 23:34:31	~deepend	not yet.. how r u
2018-11-26 23:34:33	mushmouth	deepend: i like the games and applications you setup for me on that dos machine
2018-11-26 23:34:37	mushmouth	i got it working with win3.11
2018-11-26 23:34:47	mushmouth	im looking for the tcp/ip drivers for it
2018-11-26 23:34:51	mushmouth	if you know where it is
2018-11-26 23:35:15	mushmouth	i'll transfer it to my floppy and install it
2018-11-26 23:36:10	mushmouth	sound i just gotta copy it from that floppy you gave me i think
2018-11-26 23:36:16	~deepend	just the tcp/ip drivers  ? or also network card driver? 
2018-11-26 23:36:21	mushmouth	im not sure
2018-11-26 23:36:28	mushmouth	never worked with dos/3.11 before
2018-11-26 23:36:50	mushmouth	like just to have ethernet?
2018-11-26 23:36:54	mushmouth	that what i mean
2018-11-26 23:36:56	~deepend	I dont remember what network card I put in that system.. 
2018-11-26 23:37:06	mushmouth	can i do a hwinfo on that system?
2018-11-26 23:37:53	~deepend	easiest to open it and physically look at the card.. chances are pretty good that its a 3com 3c509 .. but I dont remember for sure
2018-11-26 23:38:00	mushmouth	oh it was a soundblaster
2018-11-26 23:38:09	mushmouth	one of my aunt friend looked it cause he was curious
2018-11-26 23:38:15	mushmouth	oh
2018-11-26 23:38:16	brendantcc_lounge	windows 3.11?!
2018-11-26 23:38:18	mushmouth	wrong idea
2018-11-26 23:38:20	~deepend	sound blaster is the sound yep
2018-11-26 23:38:20	mushmouth	yes
2018-11-26 23:38:22	brendantcc_lounge	how do i access this?!

2018-11-26 23:39:11	mushmouth	deepend: i have a program called hwinfo for dos
2018-11-26 23:39:14	mushmouth	should i run that
2018-11-26 23:39:18	mushmouth	and figure out the specs
2018-11-26 23:39:41	sebboh	Are we talking physical hardware or a VM?
2018-11-26 23:39:50	mushmouth	physical
2018-11-26 23:39:54	mushmouth	i own a 386 computer
2018-11-26 23:40:08	~deepend	http://virtualdiskimages.weebly.com/virtualbox.html   there is virtualbox images on this page for windows 3.11 and dos 6.22

2018-11-26 23:40:28	mushmouth	well it in my other office
2018-11-26 23:40:36	~deepend	if brendantcc_lounge wants to try windows 3.11 lol
2018-11-26 23:40:44	mushmouth	deepend: he not going to enjoy it lol
2018-11-26 23:40:49	~deepend	but outside of a virtual  machine  you couldn't run it
2018-11-26 23:40:50	mushmouth	im just weird like that
2018-11-26 23:41:07	sebboh	oh, you're physically near it.  Ok.  Well, your sound blaster card, it's an ISA interface, right?  386 is pre-PCI...
2018-11-26 23:41:09	mushmouth	sebboh: i have a bus mouse which deepend gave me thank you
2018-11-26 23:41:25	mushmouth	yeah sound blaster 16
2018-11-26 23:41:27	mushmouth	i believe
2018-11-26 23:41:28	sebboh	So it's going to have jumpers on it that set the IRQ.
2018-11-26 23:41:41	~deepend	most likely not. but I like to spread the passion i have for old hardware/software :D 
2018-11-26 23:41:42	mushmouth	right deepend ?
2018-11-26 23:41:45	sebboh	you will need to know the IRQ and maybe other parameters.
2018-11-26 23:41:50	mushmouth	:P
2018-11-26 23:42:01	mushmouth	im going to do a hwinfo for now
2018-11-26 23:42:03	mushmouth	brb
2018-11-26 23:42:08	~deepend	probably.. but might have been a better one.. again I dont remember for sure what I put in that.. 
2018-11-26 23:42:56	~deepend	easier to open it up. I almost thought I sent network drivers on a floppy for you.. but maybe that was just sound :S
2018-11-26 23:43:39	sebboh	dos-era hwinfo is going to send a few well known commands to likely IRQ and ... IO-something, what is the name of the memory-space offset number?  It is the other parameter you need after IRQ to tell a game to talk to a soundblaster card.
2018-11-26 23:44:17	sebboh	Does this 386 have a math co-processor? :D
2018-11-26 23:45:29	 *	sebboh pulls up a chair
2018-11-26 23:46:28	~deepend	yes it does I believe
2018-11-26 23:46:39	sebboh	How much ram does it have?  What form factor?  SIMMs?
2018-11-26 23:46:43	~deepend	4MB
2018-11-26 23:47:04	sebboh	so probably not DIPPs.
2018-11-26 23:47:14	~deepend	30 pin simms
2018-11-26 23:47:31	~deepend	386SX/16
2018-11-26 23:48:03	sebboh	cool.  cool.  ISA?  Any other bus?  What kind of video board?

2018-11-26 23:58:14	sebboh	I don't know if they are a good company to buy for.  A web search for "ISA bus" hdmi turned them up.  That page has both new and old cards on one page, that's why it matched.. ;P  I have not yet found someone using a FPGA or something to produce an ISA card that has HDMI out.  Let me know if you find one!
2018-11-27 00:16:29	~deepend	youd just have to buy a VGA to HDMI converter

2018-11-27 01:29:27	~deepend	in time we have plans of joining opennic to integrate .tilde with them
2018-11-27 01:31:31	bumbaklat	if you had an RZM account, you could simply inject your namespace ;)

2018-11-27 02:16:19	bumbaklat	i spent like 2-3 hours today blocking ddos
2018-11-27 02:16:20	~tomasino	i'm on vacation
2018-11-27 02:16:29	bumbaklat	so tickets and provisioning got backed up
2018-11-27 02:16:32	~tomasino	did you have to have two people typing on one keyboard?
2018-11-27 02:16:37	brendantcc_lounge	oh yeah thats right you mentioned it on anonradio, tomasino
2018-11-27 02:16:43	bumbaklat	so i'm like 5 people where i work

2018-11-27 02:17:02	brendantcc_lounge	lmaooo
2018-11-27 02:17:06	bumbaklat	but i don't do things concurrently
2018-11-27 02:17:19	bumbaklat	i'll quote charles emerson winchester iii on this one
2018-11-27 02:17:19	~tomasino	it's hard to be five people at the same time
2018-11-27 02:17:28	bumbaklat	i do one thing very well, then move on
2018-11-27 02:18:26	bumbaklat	basically make up for delays with no less than excellent quality of response
2018-11-27 02:18:40	brendantcc_lounge	tomasino: irony is, i just opened a youtube tab just before you sent that
2018-11-27 02:18:41	~tomasino	that's a good way to do it
2018-11-27 02:19:13	brendantcc_lounge	so what's been happening, everyone?
2018-11-27 02:19:49	~tomasino	building ship pages for cosmic.web
2018-11-27 02:19:50	bumbaklat	so it's not technically multi-tasking as much as multi-queueing
2018-11-27 02:19:59	~tomasino	looking pretty good on both gopher and web now
2018-11-27 02:20:18	~tomasino	isn't all queuing multi-queueing?
2018-11-27 02:20:26	bumbaklat	there's screen and whatnot but as far as actually doing different complex problems simultaneously
2018-11-27 02:21:09	bumbaklat	it's not feasible to do more than perhaps 2, because there's also chats, calls, monitoring, and abuse
2018-11-27 02:25:18	bumbaklat	if there were a way to reorder tree style tabs (firefox) child tabs inside of a parent of a particular domain, and interact with the API of that site with JS to get the ticket status and re-order the child tabs by SLA Time Remaining ascending, while keeping the child tabs of those tickets under the correct parent that would be cool
2018-11-27 02:33:10	SinaCutie	I was poking at pixelfed but it does not seem to want to cooperate, so I'm gonna give it a rest for a while.
2018-11-27 02:33:12	bumbaklat	or just have an auto reply "hold the fuck on man" after 3 minutes of a secondary reply after 30 minutes past their prior reply
2018-11-27 02:43:58	brendantcc_lounge	say wut
2018-11-27 02:44:17	brendantcc_lounge	im gonna check out firefox (even tho i sorta dont wanna)
2018-11-27 02:45:16	brendantcc_lounge	and of course firefox wants to trigger the UAC
2018-11-27 02:47:41	brendantcc_lounge	and we're in!
2018-11-27 02:47:57	brendantcc_lounge	(im logged into thelounge on ff)
2018-11-27 02:51:10	brendantcc_lounge	ewww it's using fricking times new roman instead of monospace

2018-11-27 02:52:46	~deepend	tomasino: really like your cosmic voyage pages. :)

2018-11-27 02:55:58	brendantcc_lounge	ahhh this is better
2018-11-27 02:56:11	brendantcc_lounge	just set default font to "Consolas"
2018-11-27 02:56:39	zyeri	Consolas is the best font Windows ships with
2018-11-27 02:57:09	~deepend	best font windows comes with is the one you see when you turn your computer off :P  
2018-11-27 02:57:20	~deepend	*black screen*
2018-11-27 02:57:29	zyeri	I normally use Iosevka but if I'm being lazy and don't want to download and add it to Windows, Consolas it is
2018-11-27 02:57:43	brendantcc_lounge	har har very funny deepend
2018-11-27 02:57:49	zyeri	which usually means I use Consolas on Windows because I'm very lazy
2018-11-27 02:58:23	zyeri	that and windows doesn't like to RENDER FONTS CORRECTLY GODDAMN IT MICROSOFT WHY
2018-11-27 02:58:39	brendantcc_lounge	well that's just FF's case
2018-11-27 02:58:40	brendantcc_lounge	lol
2018-11-27 02:58:46	amcclure[team]	hello
2018-11-27 02:59:03	zyeri	FF? firefox? actually don't have problems with that on windows
2018-11-27 02:59:06	brendantcc_lounge	hey hi amcclure[team]! welcome back!
2018-11-27 02:59:11	zyeri	amcclure[team]: hello! o/
2018-11-27 02:59:16	amcclure[team]	ty brendantcc_lounge and zyeri 
2018-11-27 02:59:20	zyeri	<3
2018-11-27 02:59:31	brendantcc_lounge	zyeri: i'm on school network, and it's not playing nicely
2018-11-27 02:59:40	zyeri	still, the solution to bad font rendering is MORE PIXELS
2018-11-27 02:59:46	amcclure[team]	:(
2018-11-27 02:59:48	zyeri	oof, school networks. High school?
2018-11-27 02:59:54	brendantcc_lounge	complaints everywhere about "certificate issuer not recognized"
2018-11-27 03:00:09	brendantcc_lounge	zyeri: depends on what school a year 8 student goes to over there
2018-11-27 03:00:10	zyeri	Haha, yeah that sounds like a high school network. Or a really shitty university.
2018-11-27 03:00:26	zyeri	uh actually I don't know? I was homescholled
2018-11-27 03:00:34	zyeri	s/scholled/schooled/
2018-11-27 03:00:34	sedbot	<zyeri> uh actually I don't know? I was homeschooled
2018-11-27 03:01:17	zyeri	still, university networks tend to be basically unrestricted; my uni only blocks known malicious sites, for example
2018-11-27 03:01:28	~tomasino	thanks deepend 
2018-11-27 03:01:41	brendantcc_lounge	lol righto
2018-11-27 03:07:03	~ben	consolas is actually a decent font
2018-11-27 03:07:37	brendantcc_lounge	ben: help! the school network is screwing firefox around, making it think the connection is insecure
2018-11-27 03:07:48	~ben	sounds like they're MITM'ing you
2018-11-27 03:07:59	brendantcc_lounge	uunngghh

2018-11-27 03:19:39	SinaCutie	Thanks!
2018-11-27 03:19:53	~tomasino	true true. great domain
2018-11-27 03:19:54	~ben	how many domains do you have now SinaCutie ?
2018-11-27 03:19:56	~ben	:D
2018-11-27 03:20:01	SinaCutie	I own ~20.
2018-11-27 03:20:27	~deepend	seems like everyone on here has a bunch of domains :P

2018-11-27 03:21:17	amcclure[team]	how much do all those domains cost lol
2018-11-27 03:21:19	~ben	like 20 are tilde-related
2018-11-27 03:21:26	SinaCutie	I run stuff for people, so it is only natural that I end up with a plethora of domain names.
2018-11-27 03:21:33	~ben	i don't have any that are more than $25/yr
2018-11-27 03:21:48	SinaCutie	I think only one of mine is 20€+ but I'm not sure. xD
2018-11-27 03:21:53	amcclure[team]	o
2018-11-27 03:22:05	~tomasino	i think gopher.black is $35
2018-11-27 03:22:07	~ben	tilde.team and tilde.zone were $40/yr on my old registrar
2018-11-27 03:22:10	~tomasino	but it makes me so happy
2018-11-27 03:22:21	~ben	but tomasino got me to switch to namesilo and it's been quite good
2018-11-27 03:22:30	amcclure[team]	o.O
2018-11-27 03:22:30	~tomasino	namesilo has great pricing
2018-11-27 03:22:34	~ben	ye they do
2018-11-27 03:22:35	~deepend	seems to
2018-11-27 03:22:36	amcclure[team]	expensive
2018-11-27 03:22:42	SinaCutie	I have never heard of them until now.
2018-11-27 03:22:49	~tomasino	some tld's are more than others, sadly
2018-11-27 03:22:58	amcclure[team]	we're considering namesilo for new thunix
2018-11-27 03:22:58	~deepend	i have 2 domains so far with namesilo.. will be moving all my domains to them as I can afford to do so lol
2018-11-27 03:23:02	~ben	i read an article earlier today about the guys who bought cover.com
2018-11-27 03:23:15	~tomasino	oh the 875k thing?
2018-11-27 03:23:19	~ben	yah
2018-11-27 03:23:38	~tomasino	i have that noted to read
2018-11-27 03:23:41	~tomasino	worth it?
2018-11-27 03:24:00	~ben	they didn't recommend doing that for anyone else but it seems to be working out for them?
2018-11-27 03:24:02	~ben	i think
2018-11-27 03:24:21	npa	do you have a link for that article, sounds interesting
2018-11-27 03:25:02	~tomasino	https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/you-should-never-spend-825k-on-a-domain-but-heres-why-i-m-glad-i-did-7139f9c00728
2018-11-27 03:25:03	TildeBot	You should never spend $825K on a domain — but here’s why I’m glad I did https://bhh.sh/25o
2018-11-27 03:25:53	~tomasino	i was originally going to buy all the color tld's for "gopher"
2018-11-27 03:25:59	~tomasino	but most of them are taken, amazingly
2018-11-27 03:27:49	~deepend	I wanna take over midi.com  but mostly for nostalgia more then anything. 
2018-11-27 03:28:44	~tomasino	.black is $40. first year promotionally $12
2018-11-27 03:29:25	npa	holy heck, that's expensive 825k
2018-11-27 03:29:31	~deepend	i hate those short promotions.. pisses me off lol
2018-11-27 03:29:41	~ben	1st year promotions are annoying
2018-11-27 03:29:46	~ben	just charge me the same price always
2018-11-27 03:29:47	npa	most expensive domain i have is my .sh one which is ~30usd a year or something
2018-11-27 03:29:54	~ben	oh i have two .sh
2018-11-27 03:29:56	~tomasino	namesilo doesn't hide the regular prices at least
2018-11-27 03:29:56	~ben	heh
2018-11-27 03:30:04	~ben	yeah they're liste
2018-11-27 03:30:06	~ben	s/$/d
2018-11-27 03:30:07	sedbot	<ben> yeah they're listed
2018-11-27 03:30:11	~tomasino	they show you the normal and the discount side by side so you know what you're getting into
2018-11-27 03:30:14	npa	i'm very very proud of my pat.sh domain
2018-11-27 03:30:20	npa	one day i'll make it sick
2018-11-27 03:30:22	SinaCutie	Hee
2018-11-27 03:30:40	~tomasino	we should make the .$$$ tld and just charge astronomical figures for a name
2018-11-27 03:30:50	~tomasino	domains of prestige
2018-11-27 03:30:54	~ben	$35.99 for .sh
2018-11-27 03:30:58	~deepend	could just add it to the .tilde domain service lol
2018-11-27 03:31:05	~ben	pat.sh almost sounds like patch
2018-11-27 03:31:14	~tomasino	pat.sh is great

2018-11-27 05:28:10	~deepend	so nginx is fast is it.. is there a good way for us to compare nginx to apache.. head to head? :D lol

2018-11-27 05:28:58	~ben	but i'm always down for a head-to-head

2018-11-27 05:29:59	fosslinux	but then it just does it gain
2018-11-27 05:30:26	~ben	location is going to be a factor too
2018-11-27 05:30:33	fosslinux	?
2018-11-27 05:30:40	~deepend	just put a suicide code in the bot.. tell it to kill itself if it uses high cpu usage? :D

2018-11-27 05:34:45	~ben	and about the same for dynamic stuff
2018-11-27 05:35:04	~ben	since that's held up in the dynamic processing anyways

2018-11-27 06:29:44	~ben	holy we have 6 servers in the dns round-robin now
2018-11-27 06:29:51	~ben	what a feeling
2018-11-27 06:30:18	~deepend	noice  :D 
2018-11-27 06:31:29	~ben	should be less SPOFs
2018-11-27 06:31:46	~deepend	well for the people that use the round robin that is :D 
2018-11-27 06:32:07	~ben	heh that's tru
2018-11-27 06:32:19	~ben	but it should be nice and localhost 6667 
2018-11-27 06:32:43	~deepend	yup
2018-11-27 06:33:19	~deepend	now we just need to setup a second hub.. so if your server goes down we could have  it so all servers just jump to another hub and the network keeps on ticking 
2018-11-27 06:33:30	~ben	oh ye
2018-11-27 06:33:33	~ben	that would be a good idea
2018-11-27 06:33:41	~ben	everything is still connecting to ~team
2018-11-27 06:33:43	~ben	lol
2018-11-27 06:33:59	~ben	maybe a europe hub and a north america hub?
2018-11-27 06:34:17	~deepend	or even just setup a more centrally located hub .. instead of running the hub off your ircd in germany 
2018-11-27 06:34:33	~ben	oh like a server on its own?
2018-11-27 06:34:45	~deepend	yup
2018-11-27 06:34:47	~ben	probably a good idea
2018-11-27 06:35:03	~ben	ny or quebec or something
2018-11-27 06:35:09	~ben	services there too?
2018-11-27 06:35:18	~deepend	even a cheap vultr or digital ocean option would be a good option
2018-11-27 06:35:21	~ben	ye
2018-11-27 06:35:40	~ben	smollest box
2018-11-27 06:35:53	~ben	could put the site on there too i suppose
2018-11-27 06:36:02	~ben	i'd like to get the configs nailed down better too
2018-11-27 06:36:13	~deepend	vultr does have a vps for $3.5.. lacking in transfer but doubt a small irc network like this would use 500G in a month
2018-11-27 06:36:29	~ben	yeah no way
2018-11-27 06:36:37	~ben	~team barely used 500gb transfer all year
2018-11-27 06:36:40	~ben	so far
2018-11-27 06:36:49	~ben	i bet it's a bit higher now
2018-11-27 06:37:12	~deepend	site should always be seperate from the ircd in my opinion.. then if ircd is down and network is in shambles there is somewhere a status could be posted lol
2018-11-27 06:37:23	~ben	status.tildeverse.org
2018-11-27 06:39:15	~deepend	https://tilderadio.org/system-status/   could use this php script and make a status page for all services of tildeverse?  :D

2018-11-27 16:51:50	mushmouth	also i heard from some audio reviews. if a speaker too flat it doesn't sound as good as it could be?

2018-11-27 17:05:14	~ben	what do you name your machines?

2018-11-27 17:05:42	+jan6	indeed
2018-11-27 17:05:59	+jan6	it doesn't sound good for bassy songs
2018-11-27 17:06:08	+aewens	Then there's nuc and frankenstein, nuc for the Intel NUC and Frankenstein for the computer made of the used parts from other dead machines.
2018-11-27 17:06:47	+jan6	also it's the kind of good that people naturally like deeper tones better than higher ones, but, you can just use an equalizer
2018-11-27 17:07:15	mushmouth	i honestly do like deeper tones
2018-11-27 17:08:30	+jan6	then feel free to use an equalizer, or any regular speaker or stuff
2018-11-27 17:08:49	~ben	such boring names! i'd forget which is which
2018-11-27 17:08:54	+jan6	for computers it's easy to filter it exactly how you like
2018-11-27 17:09:30	~ben	it's easier to do eq on a speaker with a flatter sound profile
2018-11-27 17:09:52	~ben	since you're not starting out by compensating for it already
2018-11-27 17:10:44	+jan6	^
2018-11-27 17:11:59	+jan6	and it should be close to the same profile for all speakers, no matter the specific model
2018-11-27 17:12:15	+aewens	ben: That's why I add an alias to them in /etc/hosts if I ever forget ae01 is the production server and ae02 is the development server.
2018-11-27 17:12:44	~ben	alias to?
2018-11-27 17:12:50	+jan6	aedev and aeprod
2018-11-27 17:12:50	+aewens	But really, if I cannot remember that then I really shouldn't be managing servers.
2018-11-27 17:13:22	mushmouth	hey ben you know the script that rms uses to grab web pages from the web and to the email?
2018-11-27 17:13:30	+aewens	I have an alias in /etc/hosts for SSHing to them from my desktop.
2018-11-27 17:13:38	+jan6	aliases 01, 02 and 03, one if team, one is production, and one is a proxy server to development
2018-11-27 17:13:51	+jan6	and you better not mix up ;P
2018-11-27 17:13:54	~ben	aewens: that kind of alias probably belongs in ~/.ssh/config
2018-11-27 17:14:19	+aewens	Yeah, because `ping ae01` is something I'd never want to do.
2018-11-27 17:14:21	~ben	mushmouth: no i don't

2018-11-27 17:17:34	~ben	oh that sounds vaguely familiar
2018-11-27 17:17:46	mushmouth	i was wondering if i could have that on here or yourtilde

2018-11-27 19:56:51	+aewens	Part of my issue searching this stuff is not knowing ahead of time what weechat calls all of this stuff.

2018-11-27 19:57:25	+aewens	I think it was cirno?

2018-11-27 20:36:49	+jan6	kilomonths
2018-11-27 20:36:54	+jan6	gigamonths
2018-11-27 20:36:56	+jan6	ez
2018-11-27 20:37:06	~ben	decamonths
2018-11-27 20:37:10	cdmnky	jan6: what is this, napoleonic france with their metric time
2018-11-27 20:37:10	dokuja	It's 5 o'clock somewhere, +/- 30 minutes
2018-11-27 20:37:30	cdmnky	ben: and then decamonths would be 12 months because Caesar
2018-11-27 20:37:36	dokuja	Hrm, and then there's those half hour offset timezones...
2018-11-27 20:37:50	~ben	aren't there :15 tz's too?
2018-11-27 20:38:06	+aewens	Man needs to stop trying to fit the chaos of nature and space into our static measurements of time.
2018-11-27 20:38:29	~ben	what about Woman
2018-11-27 20:38:29	+jan6	also @ last video, tl;dw, vpn provider gets same info your ISP would get otherwise, therefore self-host vpn, also ip is one of the least used tracking systems today
2018-11-27 20:38:39	cdmnky	TIL there's a calendar wiki http://calendars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page
2018-11-27 20:38:40	+jan6	lol @ ben
2018-11-27 20:38:48	+aewens	ben: Did you just assume gender?
2018-11-27 20:39:00	~ben	you started it lol
2018-11-27 20:39:03	+jan6	discordian calendar seems fit for a follower of chaos, aewens 
2018-11-27 20:39:40	+aewens	That's why I'm trying to think of a nice way to measure time that is in no way predictable or static.
2018-11-27 20:40:12	~ben	lol we already have that
2018-11-27 20:40:23	+aewens	ben: I used man as an abbreviation of mankind, which is an abbreviation for homo sapiens, of which we all are (maybe).
2018-11-27 20:40:37	~ben	oh i see
2018-11-27 20:40:51	~ben	i think i wouldv'e just said humans 
2018-11-27 20:40:53	cdmnky	here's a fun command: cal September 1752
2018-11-27 20:40:55	+jan6	milliseconds since unix epoch to the power of 3 divided by 3, aewens
2018-11-27 20:41:10	~ben	1 2 14
2018-11-27 20:42:37	+aewens	ben: You could also say man is short for human I suppose.
2018-11-27 20:43:04	~ben	ok
2018-11-27 20:43:08	+aewens	I kinda want to make a calendar using my wacky idea and code up a watch face for my pebble watch using it.
2018-11-27 20:43:31	+jan6	binary calendar
2018-11-27 20:43:35	+jan6	do it
2018-11-27 20:43:50	+jan6	better yet, ternary calendar ;P
2018-11-27 20:44:18	~ben	trinary
2018-11-27 20:44:33	+jan6	ternary is the proper term, apparently
2018-11-27 20:44:42	~ben	yeah i nkow
2018-11-27 20:44:44	cdmnky	jan6: why confine a calendar to such concepts of binary and trinary? what if we let the calendar decide what it is?
2018-11-27 20:44:45	+jan6	trits and trytes
2018-11-27 20:44:52	+jan6	you can't
2018-11-27 20:44:54	~ben	trinary isn't wrong though
2018-11-27 20:45:13	+jan6	it's not right either
2018-11-27 20:45:57	+aewens	000000000 - 101101100 can encode the days of the year (0 to 365)
2018-11-27 20:46:17	cdmnky	101101101
2018-11-27 20:46:31	+aewens	s/365/364/
2018-11-27 20:46:31	sedbot	<aewens> 000000000 - 101101100 can encode the days of the year (0 to 364)
2018-11-27 20:47:39	+jan6	just figure out a way to have it all in one string
2018-11-27 20:47:55	+jan6	kinda like how the chmod modes work
2018-11-27 20:52:14	+aewens	A stellar day is about 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds. The moon orbits every 29.5 stellar days. And we orbit the sun every 366.2422 stellar days.
2018-11-27 20:53:13	+aewens	So, I say we measure the day using a 360 degree clock that normalizes the stellar day from 0 to 100% rather than 0 to 23:56:4.1
2018-11-27 20:53:33	+jan6	why 360 degree?
2018-11-27 20:53:49	+jan6	I say, a linear scale golden ratio spiral!
2018-11-27 20:53:55	+aewens	Fine, 2 pi or tau degrees. Point is, it's a circle.
2018-11-27 20:53:59	cdmnky	did you know? !eparg a no yregrus did yehT
2018-11-27 20:54:38	+aewens	But then the next ring will measure the time until a full moon, and the next ring will measure the time until a solar orbit completes.
2018-11-27 20:55:10	+jan6	cdmnky: t'ndid yeht ,yan
2018-11-27 20:56:17	+aewens	What about the grape?
2018-11-27 20:56:27	cdmnky	they did surgery on it
2018-11-27 20:56:55	+jan6	yan
2018-11-27 20:57:03	+aewens	jan6: If I don't do the 3 circles, I might steal your idea and make three golden spirals and have it trace along it's path.
2018-11-27 20:57:34	+jan6	1 one way, other other way, and third on the background
2018-11-27 20:57:35	cdmnky	why not make the base time be the pulses of a pulsar?
2018-11-27 20:57:56	+jan6	tbh the circles idea can actually be made into an IRL device
2018-11-27 20:58:33	+jan6	easily, I mean
2018-11-27 20:58:37	+aewens	jan6: That was the idea, I'll probably make one using the HTML5 canvas and host it on my ~team page.

2018-11-27 22:20:52	midlow	i dont need a browser i just need a lua "browser" (if u can call it that) so i can ""emulate"" a user going itno a website and logging in
2018-11-27 22:21:02	+jan6	use coreplus anyway yeah, and 100 is NOT 200 mb
2018-11-27 22:21:09	midlow	coreplus is 170mb

2018-11-27 22:22:35	SinaCutie	You could have had all of these distros installed by now
2018-11-27 22:22:37	~ben	smallest debian image is like 100mb
2018-11-27 22:22:43	+jan6	debian console install takes like 10 min and 500 megs, I'd estimate
2018-11-27 22:22:47	midlow	alpine linux was like the best choice
2018-11-27 22:22:48	~ben	or at least it is for docker and lxd images
2018-11-27 22:22:51	midlow	but it was fucked
2018-11-27 22:22:59	+jan6	how so

2018-11-27 22:23:09	+jan6	don't blame your mistakes on others
2018-11-27 22:23:16	+aewens	There was nothing wrong with Alphine, it was just a PEBKAC error
2018-11-27 22:23:16	~ben	amcclure: have you consolidated your weechats yet
2018-11-27 22:23:21	midlow	no no

2018-11-27 22:23:48	midlow	i installed it though
2018-11-27 22:23:55	midlow	didnt show up at all
2018-11-27 22:24:07	+jan6	you need guest tools only to copy-paste BETWEEN vm and host, and stuff like that
2018-11-27 22:24:10	+aewens	Like I said, classic PEBKAC error
2018-11-27 22:24:19	+aewens	And what jan6 said
2018-11-27 22:24:23	+jan6	so you actually don't even need it for anything
2018-11-27 22:24:31	+jan6	it's just "a nice thing"
2018-11-27 22:24:50	midlow	"you need to install the VirtualBox guest additions as well. They contain parts of the driver, without them, XFCE won't start."
2018-11-27 22:24:52	+aewens	A nice thing would be midlow having already picked and installed any one of the distros we listed already
2018-11-27 22:25:04	+jan6	also for alpine

2018-11-27 22:25:22	+jan6	then you don't need extra installs
2018-11-27 22:25:39	+aewens	midlow: So it's done then?

2018-11-27 22:29:19	+aewens	The answer has always been yes
2018-11-27 22:29:23	+jan6	^
2018-11-27 22:29:24	SinaCutie	I assume everything in my past will be stupid to future me.

2018-11-27 23:08:25	+aewens	I always thought that if my marriage ended it'd be coming from her and not me. I'm still not sure how I pulled it off since she's quite out of my league.
2018-11-27 23:10:11	+aewens	I even started out dating her with "Are you sure you want to do this? I'm an asshole, this cannot possibly be a good deal for you." And now it's 5 years later.
2018-11-27 23:12:16	~ben	heh i mean you were up front about it
2018-11-27 23:13:34	+aewens	I was going through this weird new outlook on life. I was tired of trying to be someone I'm not, so I just decided to lay out all my cards at the beginning.

2018-11-28 01:09:28	~ben	but maybe just have it stop responding for every mention
2018-11-28 01:10:01	~deepend	is just how that feature works .. is either on or off. not anywhere in the middle
2018-11-28 01:10:19	~ben	i don't hate it 
2018-11-28 01:10:23	 *	tomasino hates it

2018-11-28 01:10:51	~deepend	brain.. and see where it takes us
2018-11-28 01:10:59	~ben	worth a try i suppose
2018-11-28 01:11:22	ubergeek|lounge	Why do people people hate on TildeBot mentions?
2018-11-28 01:11:23	~deepend	well I think lots of people like it.. with how many people are spamming the bot daily
2018-11-28 01:11:24	TildeBot	ubergeek|lounge, , You know how master jan6 doesn't approve killing people, jan6 is my favourite because i do.
2018-11-28 01:11:35	ubergeek|lounge	Lol
2018-11-28 01:11:42	~deepend	hey ubergeek|lounge 
2018-11-28 01:11:51	ubergeek|lounge	Hey everyone
2018-11-28 01:11:57	~ben	o/
2018-11-28 01:12:00	~ben	waddup
2018-11-28 01:12:02	ubergeek|lounge	I hate atlassians tools btw
2018-11-28 01:12:06	~ben	fuck jira
2018-11-28 01:12:23	ubergeek|lounge	And bitbucket
2018-11-28 01:12:29	ubergeek|lounge	And hipchat
2018-11-28 01:12:39	~ben	i thought hipchat was gone and merged into slack
2018-11-28 01:12:40	ubergeek|lounge	And bamboo
2018-11-28 01:12:56	ubergeek|lounge	It is, but I still get to babysit an install
2018-11-28 01:12:59	~ben	luckily we only have jira and confluence
2018-11-28 01:13:10	~ben	oh nice legacy
2018-11-28 01:13:23	~deepend	so ubergeek|lounge .. vultr is complaining about the recursive dns server.. not sure if they would do anything but got a security related message from them today.. but recursive has to be enabled and open for the whole project to even function
2018-11-28 01:13:33	ubergeek|lounge	Confluence wasn't too bad until they turned it into a shitty Google docs clone
2018-11-28 01:13:48	ubergeek|lounge	What is their complaint?
2018-11-28 01:14:14	~deepend	just the security implications of a open recursive dns server.
2018-11-28 01:14:31	ubergeek|lounge	Just not liking public recursive DNS servers?
2018-11-28 01:14:37	~ben	:o
2018-11-28 01:14:40	~ben	rude
2018-11-28 01:14:44	~ben	you're the one paying them
2018-11-28 01:14:52	ubergeek|lounge	^^^
2018-11-28 01:14:52	~ben	is there anything about it in their ToS?
2018-11-28 01:14:55	~deepend	most places dont. since apparently they can be used to do a DDOS attack
2018-11-28 01:15:04	~ben	don't what?
2018-11-28 01:15:05	~deepend	but I ahven't seen anything in any TOS about it.. so not sure
2018-11-28 01:15:28	~ben	i wonder what the opennic people do for hosting then
2018-11-28 01:15:29	ubergeek|lounge	The only issue I know of is amplification attacks, but they should be stopping those anyways by blocking spoofed packets
2018-11-28 01:15:53	~deepend	you'd think 
2018-11-28 01:15:55	~deepend	lol
2018-11-28 01:16:17	~ben	weird
2018-11-28 01:16:26	~deepend	and other attacks I know of are somewhat dealt with by randomization of the udp source port
2018-11-28 01:16:45	ubergeek|lounge	Exactly
2018-11-28 01:16:58	~deepend	unless that is also related to the amplification attacks
2018-11-28 01:17:59	~deepend	but either way.. never seen anything in TOS or AUP relating to open recursive dns servers
2018-11-28 01:18:50	~ben	definitely worth following up on that
2018-11-28 01:18:56	ubergeek|lounge	I think maybe just reply with the mitigation of randomized udp should allay their concerns
2018-11-28 01:19:07	~ben	yeah that too ^
2018-11-28 01:19:58	~deepend	yeah. i will reply with the intentions of the server.. so they know its not open by accident
2018-11-28 01:21:40	~ben	good call
2018-11-28 01:37:37	~deepend	think I can enable some firewall features just in case.. not sure what a sensible setting would be
2018-11-28 01:38:29	ubergeek|lounge	Yeah, I'm not sure, without specific concerns named
2018-11-28 01:40:48	~deepend	basically enable a portflood protection.  say put a limit on port 53 of a certain amount of connections from an ip within a certain amount of seconds
2018-11-28 01:41:51	~ben	seems reasonable
2018-11-28 01:42:13	~deepend	but how many connections per how many seconds should be within reason? lol 
2018-11-28 01:43:00	~ben	1000?
2018-11-28 01:44:04	mushmouth	9million?
2018-11-28 01:44:18	mushmouth	hey deepend 
2018-11-28 01:45:18	~ben	1

2018-11-28 01:46:07	ubergeek|lounge	I'd think 100/sec is reasoanble
2018-11-28 01:46:21	~ben	i didn't have any til after work
2018-11-28 01:46:29	~deepend	so 100/100seconds?
2018-11-28 01:46:39	~deepend	1000/100 seconds?

2018-11-28 02:28:26	mushmouth	could never find a good one
2018-11-28 02:28:29	ahriman	if you go the self-hosted route, don't forget to set up DKIM, DMARC, and SPF records, in addition to a PTR record / reverse DNS
2018-11-28 02:28:34	~ben	yupp
2018-11-28 02:28:55	mushmouth	could someone maybe write me a tutorial for ubuntu server or something?
2018-11-28 02:28:59	ahriman	if you don't set all that up your reputation will start off shit and nothing will get delivered
2018-11-28 02:29:11	~ben	and all the certs and stuff
2018-11-28 02:29:19	mushmouth	that's the only hard part

2018-11-28 02:30:58	mushmouth	https://mailinabox.email/
2018-11-28 02:30:59	TildeBot	Mail-in-a-Box 
2018-11-28 02:30:59	~ben	i just skimmed it but this looks reasonable
2018-11-28 02:31:04	mushmouth	im thinking of using this
2018-11-28 02:31:09	mushmouth	works with ubuntu i believe
2018-11-28 02:31:14	~ben	https://www.iredmail.org/
2018-11-28 02:31:15	TildeBot	iRedMail - Free, Open Source Mail Server Solution 
2018-11-28 02:31:31	~ben	mailinabox assumes you haven't done anything else on that server
2018-11-28 02:31:42	mushmouth	iredmail would be better?
2018-11-28 02:31:59	~ben	it doesn't require a fresh vps
2018-11-28 02:32:09	~ben	if you have anything else set up there
2018-11-28 02:34:44	ahriman	iredmail looks cool, never heard of it before
2018-11-28 02:35:23	mushmouth	do i need mail.mushmouth.ca if i already have mushmouth.ca?
2018-11-28 02:35:28	mushmouth	cause this part will confuse me
2018-11-28 02:35:38	~ben	not necessarily
2018-11-28 02:35:58	~ben	you'd only need it if the mailserver were on a different machine
2018-11-28 02:36:14	ahriman	you'll need to set up an MX record but it can be mushmouth.ca -> MX -> mushmouth.ca
2018-11-28 02:36:25	ahriman	set ttl to like 16400
2018-11-28 02:37:09	~ben	yeah that's fine
2018-11-28 02:37:13	~ben	i like to set it lower
2018-11-28 02:37:29	ahriman	what do you use, 3600?
2018-11-28 02:38:11	~ben	i've been using cloudflare lately for the certbot integration
2018-11-28 02:38:11	mushmouth	priority suggestion?
2018-11-28 02:38:14	~ben	so auto
2018-11-28 02:38:26	ahriman	priority is relative
2018-11-28 02:38:30	ahriman	it can be any value
2018-11-28 02:38:32	ahriman	just put 1
2018-11-28 02:38:33	mushmouth	10?
2018-11-28 02:38:35	ahriman	or 10
2018-11-28 02:38:37	~ben	only matters if you have other mx records
2018-11-28 02:40:19	ahriman	yeah like if you had two mail servers, the primary one would have to have a lower numbered priority than the secondary, but since you only have one, priority means nothing
2018-11-28 02:40:36	~ben	exactly
2018-11-28 02:44:12	mushmouth	thank you guys for the help!
2018-11-28 02:44:18	~ben	np!
2018-11-28 02:44:30	~ben	it's kinda nice to have your own mailserver
2018-11-28 02:45:00	~ben	i had my personal one separate for a while but i ended up pointing my personal domains here
2018-11-28 02:45:13	~ben	s/here/to mail.tilde.team/
2018-11-28 02:45:13	sedbot	<ben> i had my personal one separate for a while but i ended up pointing my personal domains to mail.tilde.team

2018-11-28 02:52:25	~ben	the default configs could be improved a bit imo
2018-11-28 02:52:29	brendantcc_lounge	i wish i could get a mailserver up and running in my household...

2018-11-28 02:53:08	~ben	that'll get you most of the way there
2018-11-28 02:53:10	~tomasino	i found running my own mail server to be one of the most maddening things i ever did
2018-11-28 02:53:15	~tomasino	but very good learning

2018-11-28 02:55:30	~ben	it was part time 
2018-11-28 02:56:05	ahriman	here in the states there are strict rules for under-18 employment because of our colorful history of child labor. permission from parents, restricted hours, etc
2018-11-28 02:56:32	~ben	heh yeah exactly
2018-11-28 02:56:34	ahriman	i think at 14 you can get hired but it has to be like less than 15 hours a week
2018-11-28 02:57:01	ahriman	maybe thats 15. i dunno, im 29 now so i am out of the loop, but i was working by 16

2018-11-28 03:45:33	ahriman	i asked him if he's okay, and he said yes
2018-11-28 03:47:22	ahriman	what is "the lounge" that i keep hearing about
2018-11-28 03:47:40	SinaCutie	It is a web-based irc that keeps a persistent connection to whatever networks you're on
2018-11-28 03:48:09	npa	slipyx: definitely not that wild west, he does not have a gun
2018-11-28 03:48:19	npa	anyway what the fuck just happened
2018-11-28 03:48:42	SinaCutie	It would be doubly concerning if they had one, considering they're underage.
2018-11-28 03:49:17	ahriman	npa: brendantcc_lounge flipped the fuck out and started "joking" about suicide, autism, and other things
2018-11-28 03:50:07	npa	well that's fucked
2018-11-28 03:50:17	ahriman	also made a weird emoted pseudo-sexual advance towards another user

2018-11-28 03:53:51	ahriman	oh okay ben, if he has autism i understand socializing is difficult and it's hard to process boundaries
2018-11-28 03:53:59	~ben	i told brendan that he's got to learn to control his behavior
2018-11-28 03:54:12	~ben	if he's not able to, i'll tempban him for some space
2018-11-28 03:54:58	ahriman	good compromise

2018-11-28 03:56:50	npa	hmm.. get back to me on that one, I'll have a think
2018-11-28 03:56:55	~ben	heh ok
2018-11-28 03:57:29	slipyx	think before you type
2018-11-28 03:59:51	ahriman	about the suicide/advances, remember you don't know what other people have been through, so joking about sensitive topics or making sexualized advances is not appropriate
2018-11-28 04:00:13	SinaCutie	Especially when you're just a child. >_>
2018-11-28 04:00:52	~ben	seriously

2018-11-28 04:09:12	~ben	would be more appropriate to cut off his fingers
2018-11-28 04:09:22	~ben	but in any case i'm fine with him being in prison for the rest of his life
2018-11-28 04:10:16	edwardthefma	He gets 3 meals a day free medical and a bed to sleep in
2018-11-28 04:10:56	slipyx	hm maybe i should go to prison

2018-11-28 04:11:21	edwardthefma	Recorces
2018-11-28 04:11:25	slipyx	they get paid too right

2018-11-28 04:20:35	mushmouth	ben: honestly i was also very cocky as a kid
2018-11-28 04:20:47	mushmouth	because i was the only one who knew what i was doing
2018-11-28 04:20:50	mushmouth	it felt
2018-11-28 04:21:04	mushmouth	im basically my family it
2018-11-28 04:21:09	mushmouth	so i do get asked for help a lot of the time
2018-11-28 04:21:25	mushmouth	i have to learn systems so i teach people as well
2018-11-28 04:21:28	~ben	i'd guess that most of the people here get asked by their families for tech help
2018-11-28 04:22:21	npa	^ affirmative
2018-11-28 04:22:42	mushmouth	but then when we go into tech communities like this
2018-11-28 04:22:51	mushmouth	we're faced with smarter people or at least seem to
2018-11-28 04:24:56	~ben	hard to learn from people if you're the smartest one in the room
2018-11-28 04:25:01	~ben	i like having people to learn from
2018-11-28 04:25:36	mushmouth	my biggest problem especially with servers
2018-11-28 04:25:39	mushmouth	is email and email clients
2018-11-28 04:26:14	~ben	what problem?
2018-11-28 04:27:02	mushmouth	i don't even know how to set it up and getting confused with alpine menu's
2018-11-28 04:27:21	~ben	there are plenty of guides out there
2018-11-28 04:27:40	~ben	if you have a specific question i'd be glad to walk you through it
2018-11-28 04:27:59	mushmouth	i'd just need a good tutorial if that okay with you to link me
2018-11-28 04:28:18	~ben	postfix or dovecot?
2018-11-28 04:28:22	mushmouth	alpine
2018-11-28 04:28:29	~ben	oh just the client?
2018-11-28 04:28:31	mushmouth	yeah
2018-11-28 04:28:43	~ben	i'm not as familiar with alpine as i am with {neo,}mutt
2018-11-28 04:29:04	mushmouth	i would use neomutt but i hate the idea of having a large config file and having to use an external editor
2018-11-28 04:29:06	~ben	i found enough docs to get the ~team setup
2018-11-28 04:29:19	~ben	mutt config file isn't any bigger than alpine
2018-11-28 04:29:39	mushmouth	it feels like i have to rice it/customize it a lot more
2018-11-28 04:29:46	mushmouth	to make it useable
2018-11-28 04:29:47	ahriman	mutt is nice because it calls vim
2018-11-28 04:29:51	ahriman	for me
2018-11-28 04:30:01	mushmouth	im not a vim person unless i have to use it
2018-11-28 04:30:15	ahriman	you can tell it to use nano
2018-11-28 04:30:15	mushmouth	maybe i'll give neomutt ago again
2018-11-28 04:30:26	mushmouth	in my case it'd be joe

2018-11-28 04:31:04	mushmouth	ben is your dotfile remote for mutt?
2018-11-28 04:31:13	~ben	no, it's local for on ~team

2018-11-28 05:02:22	SinaCutie	I want to sleep, but I have to be somewhere in six hours, and it will take a certain amount of preperation.
2018-11-28 05:02:38	SinaCutie	And naps and I don't get along. My naps always end up 5+ hours, even with alarms.
2018-11-28 05:03:00	ahriman	saaame here SinaCutie 
2018-11-28 05:03:28	brendantcc	same case for my brother... i have to shake him and prod him multiple times for him to even wake *up*]
2018-11-28 05:03:29	~ben	lol yeah i've never been good with naps either
2018-11-28 05:03:40	~ben	it's basically impossible to wake me up
2018-11-28 05:03:45	SinaCutie	I've been up close to 20 hours already
2018-11-28 05:03:47	SinaCutie	r i p
2018-11-28 05:03:48	~ben	uuf
2018-11-28 05:04:04	SinaCutie	I don't do well with important meetings.
2018-11-28 05:04:16	~ben	i was late to work a couple times and i ended up getting a crazy super extreme loud alarm that includes a bed shaking module
2018-11-28 05:04:23	SinaCutie	xD
2018-11-28 05:04:36	SinaCutie	I think my neighbours would do me in if I had that.
2018-11-28 05:04:41	~ben	luckily most of the meetings i have are not that important
2018-11-28 05:04:53	~ben	lol that would be that much more motivation to get up though
2018-11-28 05:05:16	SinaCutie	Well, it's not so much "important" important, more just giving a piece of paper to someone and explaining why I couldn't do a thing. So I don't get kicked out of the employment help or whatever.
2018-11-28 05:05:17	~ben	i live in a duplex so it's not that close to bother anyone
2018-11-28 05:05:32	SinaCutie	I have neighbours on 3 walls.
2018-11-28 05:05:35	~ben	more like "formal" important?
2018-11-28 05:05:38	SinaCutie	yeah.
2018-11-28 05:05:47	~ben	still no fun
2018-11-28 05:05:50	~ben	oooof
2018-11-28 05:05:58	SinaCutie	The anxiety part is not an issue this time, since I'm newly on medication for it... but the insomnia part didn't go away xD
2018-11-28 05:06:11	~ben	my upstairs neighbor has his bedroom on the opposite end of the house so that's not a problem
2018-11-28 05:06:36	~ben	new meds helping?
2018-11-28 05:06:38	SinaCutie	Below, above, and on one wall. I'm lucky enough to have three walls facing outside, since I'm on the end of a building.
2018-11-28 05:06:39	SinaCutie	VERY MUCH SO
2018-11-28 05:06:41	SinaCutie	Oh my goodness.
2018-11-28 05:06:46	~ben	glad to hear it :)
2018-11-28 05:06:50	SinaCutie	I had no expectation for them to work but they're doing miracles.
2018-11-28 05:06:58	SinaCutie	They didn't work on my sibling, so I expected the same fate.
2018-11-28 05:07:06	~ben	i love to hear when people get their stuff lined up like that :D
2018-11-28 05:07:50	~ben	oh even between family members stuff can behave differently 
2018-11-28 05:07:53	SinaCutie	Yeah. It's nice to not be so mentally crippled that I get literally nothing done.
2018-11-28 05:08:03	~ben	no shit xD
2018-11-28 05:08:03	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-11-28 05:08:27	SinaCutie	I've been this way most of my life and my doctor was like "Why the fuck have you not been to see a doctor until *now*!?"
2018-11-28 05:08:40	SinaCutie	Nearly in those same words.
2018-11-28 05:08:45	~ben	good doctor!
2018-11-28 05:08:47	SinaCutie	Or rather, equivalent for local language.
2018-11-28 05:08:54	~ben	lol right
2018-11-28 05:09:11	~ben	i originally went on the same antidepressants as my dad but i got some nasty side-effects
2018-11-28 05:09:14	SinaCutie	I started telling them and the instantly regretted it and booked me for a psychologist X'D
2018-11-28 05:09:39	SinaCutie	So far I don't really have any of the side effects, other than perhaps lack of appetite.
2018-11-28 05:09:59	~ben	my hands got super shaky and sweaty
2018-11-28 05:10:05	ahriman	i have bipolar disorder, so im on antidepressants and mood stabilizers. sometimes ya gotta bite the bullet and get medicated
2018-11-28 05:10:15	~ben	definitely helped
2018-11-28 05:10:32	SinaCutie	I might be schizophrenic, which is partly why my doctor was wondering why I never got help earlier. >_<
2018-11-28 05:10:38	~ben	oh for sure, it's important to think of it as similar to a physical illness
2018-11-28 05:10:42	~ben	just in a different organ
2018-11-28 05:10:44	SinaCutie	Yep
2018-11-28 05:10:50	SinaCutie	It's literally your brain bits and chemicals.
2018-11-28 05:10:55	~ben	exactly
2018-11-28 05:11:28	ahriman	SinaCutie: whats your age? generally schizophrenia comes out between 18 and 25
2018-11-28 05:11:38	~ben	my therapist originally recommended that i try the meds for a while (i did for a year or so), then compare without them
2018-11-28 05:11:55	SinaCutie	I am nearly 31, but have had the symptoms for about six years.
2018-11-28 05:12:05	SinaCutie	"symptoms" 
2018-11-28 05:12:07	ahriman	makes sense
2018-11-28 05:12:56	~ben	i've been off them for a couple months now and luckily haven't noticed much of a difference
2018-11-28 05:13:06	SinaCutie	That is good!
2018-11-28 05:13:10	ahriman	lucky ben
2018-11-28 05:13:23	ahriman	i notice a huge difference
2018-11-28 05:13:27	~ben	a bit of meditation and a stabler routine
2018-11-28 05:13:45	ahriman	can't look people in the eye, can't socialize, get manic and spend money and make poor decisions
2018-11-28 05:13:57	SinaCutie	My doc was happy to know I knew how to reinforce healthy coping mechanisms, and I told them that they're much easier to do when I'm not in the all-consuming anxiety. As you would figure.
2018-11-28 05:13:58	ahriman	get depressed and become a hermit
2018-11-28 05:14:00	~ben	there are so many different levels and symptoms
2018-11-28 05:14:22	SinaCutie	yeah.
2018-11-28 05:14:38	~ben	might have to get some this winter though with how little sunlight there is
2018-11-28 05:14:46	~ben	or figure something else out
2018-11-28 05:14:52	SinaCutie	As much as this is helping, if I'm diagnosed with something else, they will definitely take me off of them and put me on something entirely different. x_X Meds for schizophrenia are scary.
2018-11-28 05:14:53	brendantcc	 ben: i see on your profile on masto you have a green box and tick next to tilde.team/~ben
2018-11-28 05:14:55	ahriman	seasonal affect is very real ben

2018-11-28 05:15:51	~ben	lol #medsquad
2018-11-28 05:15:52	SinaCutie	You'd think I'd have one, given I live in the land of no light in winter. >_>
2018-11-28 05:15:56	npa	hey brendantcc - you feelin all g?
2018-11-28 05:16:08	~ben	how early does the sun set up there in lapland?

2018-11-28 05:16:50	brendantcc	oh cool
2018-11-28 05:17:20	brendantcc	npa: i mean, i was on this medication called "lovan" for a bit, apparently cause of my anxiety
2018-11-28 05:17:21	SinaCutie	really really early. At peak winter, the sun never goes above the horizon.
2018-11-28 05:17:58	~ben	oh gosh that sounds awful
2018-11-28 05:18:01	npa	me 2 brendantcc, was on that a couple years back

2018-11-28 05:18:11	SinaCutie	I feel the worse end is the always-sun summer
2018-11-28 05:18:19	SinaCutie	Watching the sun spin in the sky
2018-11-28 05:18:22	~ben	it's been getting dark by 5 here lately, 4pm ish in peak winter
2018-11-28 05:18:25	ahriman	SinaCutie: i couldn't get used to that
2018-11-28 05:18:27	brendantcc	i mean, i admit i am a little agitated sometimes
2018-11-28 05:18:28	~ben	how far north?
2018-11-28 05:18:28	npa	did yours taste like aniseed/liquorice?
2018-11-28 05:18:52	brendantcc	npa: mine tasted so bad i pretty much refused to have it
2018-11-28 05:18:56	npa	wow, that's wack SinaCutie 
2018-11-28 05:18:57	SinaCutie	Inside the artic circle.

2018-11-28 05:19:18	SinaCutie	I bet it was :D
2018-11-28 05:19:29	ahriman	fuuuuuck that noise
2018-11-28 05:19:44	SinaCutie	Luckily I'm now south of that, but it doesn't really alter that much xD
2018-11-28 05:19:54	~ben	holy that's way up there
2018-11-28 05:20:05	SinaCutie	Well, Lapland is way up there :D

2018-11-28 05:21:04	SinaCutie	XD
2018-11-28 05:21:05	brendantcc	ben: not "heeellll yeeaaahhhh!" ?
2018-11-28 05:21:10	~ben	my grandma says random finnish phrases all the time
2018-11-28 05:21:19	SinaCutie	"haista vittu ben"
2018-11-28 05:21:28	SinaCutie	Not really
2018-11-28 05:21:29	~ben	SinaCutie: what do you call the end piece of a loaf of bread?
2018-11-28 05:21:56	~ben	in finnish
2018-11-28 05:22:09	~ben	cause my whole family says something that might have come from finnish
2018-11-28 05:22:19	~ben	and no one i've ever talked to knows what i'm saying
2018-11-28 05:22:35	SinaCutie	kannikka ?

2018-11-28 05:24:55	SinaCutie	Yes.
2018-11-28 05:25:02	~ben	finnish is nuts
2018-11-28 05:25:02	SinaCutie	Finnish does not translate well with autotranslators
2018-11-28 05:25:10	SinaCutie	Our language is too complex :')
2018-11-28 05:25:17	~ben	my best friends in high school had two saunas at their house
2018-11-28 05:25:22	SinaCutie	Hee
2018-11-28 05:25:31	~ben	one wasn't enough!
2018-11-28 05:25:40	SinaCutie	Took an American friend to sauna with me and he freaked out >_>;
2018-11-28 05:25:49	~ben	lol no shit
2018-11-28 05:26:02	~ben	"wait you actually go naked!?"
2018-11-28 05:26:09	SinaCutie	"Why are you naked what is going on let me go home"
2018-11-28 05:26:33	~ben	and they lived on the beach so we would run down an jump in
2018-11-28 05:26:39	~ben	and go a bunch of times
2018-11-28 05:26:42	SinaCutie	Makes sense.
2018-11-28 05:27:04	~ben	sauna makes you brave enough to go jump in the lake in december
2018-11-28 05:27:15	SinaCutie	And swim in a winter fishing hole.
2018-11-28 05:27:20	~ben	lol that too!
2018-11-28 05:27:42	~ben	i don't like when people pronounce it as saana
2018-11-28 05:27:47	~ben	instead of sauna
2018-11-28 05:27:48	SinaCutie	I don't either :D

2018-11-28 05:29:08	~ben	makes me sad
2018-11-28 05:29:18	~ben	but i guess that's how most people would say it in english

2018-11-28 06:21:46	~ben	anyone had any luck forwarding gpg-agent with a yubikeY?
2018-11-28 06:22:17	~ben	i had it working at one point but i lost my ~/.ssh/config
2018-11-28 06:23:36	fosslinux	rip
2018-11-28 06:23:38	fosslinux	o/
2018-11-28 06:23:43	~ben	hi
2018-11-28 06:23:57	fosslinux	idk
2018-11-28 06:24:02	fosslinux	i don't have a yubikey
2018-11-28 06:24:16	npa	gpgagent? i've set up pam before with one
2018-11-28 06:24:22	npa	it will work with ssh 
2018-11-28 06:24:33	~ben	i mean yubikey or not it should be the same
2018-11-28 06:24:50	fosslinux	so you want to authenticate ssh key with gpg-agen
2018-11-28 06:25:14	brendantcc	wait a second...
2018-11-28 06:25:27	~ben	https://ttm.sh/bT.txt
2018-11-28 06:25:30	brendantcc	couldn't you theoretically use ubiKey as a form of authentication over ssh?
2018-11-28 06:25:38	~ben	no i want gpg-agent to be available on the remote
2018-11-28 06:25:38	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-11-28 06:25:47	~ben	i'm already using gpg-agent to provide my ssh key
2018-11-28 06:26:06	bumbaklat	so basically keychain
2018-11-28 06:26:09	brendantcc	*facepalm*
2018-11-28 06:26:27	brendantcc	yubikey gives off random characters when you press its button, yay or nay?
2018-11-28 06:26:31	npa	you can brendantcc, quite easily
2018-11-28 06:26:34	~ben	yes it does
2018-11-28 06:26:34	bumbaklat	not random but yes
2018-11-28 06:26:36	npa	not random
2018-11-28 06:26:42	~ben	ccccccgedndeflvgftndjnvvinlrvernurhcjujlfrfb
2018-11-28 06:26:45	brendantcc	well then!
2018-11-28 06:26:51	bumbaklat	there's always a cccccc prefix
2018-11-28 06:26:52	brendantcc	bam, that's your ssh password
2018-11-28 06:26:57	npa	vvndegjkbvcutlrvjefngkrgeflvjjlguburkinhtluu
2018-11-28 06:26:57	bumbaklat	with u2f

2018-11-28 06:27:13	~ben	not always a cccccc
2018-11-28 06:27:17	npa	mine is not a cccc
2018-11-28 06:27:19	bumbaklat	for mine it was
2018-11-28 06:27:21	npa	vvn apparently
2018-11-28 06:27:21	~ben	yubi yubi yubi
2018-11-28 06:27:26	npa	i rekeyed mine bumbaklat 
2018-11-28 06:28:23	~ben	ehhh i'll have a look tomorrow
2018-11-28 06:28:26	~ben	i need to slep
2018-11-28 06:28:28	~ben	night all
2018-11-28 06:28:31	npa	but brendantcc - you can have one time passwords (what we did above), and also a challenge response thingy, so it doesn't require contacting the yubikey servers to verify
2018-11-28 06:28:32	npa	nn ben
2018-11-28 06:28:36	brendantcc	night benny boi

2018-11-28 09:38:40	stompy	i prefer tmux for my terminals but on my local machine i prefer kde so i had to add the server and the rooms in konversation
2018-11-28 09:38:55	stompy	debian sid ftw, i enjoy the breakage

2018-11-28 09:40:35	stompy	im not usually psyched about email addresses but i gave into skynet the last few years and have been using gmail, so its rad to have a private address again
2018-11-28 09:41:51	stompy	gmail can be used with alpine and mutt but its terrible, all the HTML mail i get. sylpheed does a nice job but i miss just getting plain text emails in a tty
2018-11-28 09:42:15	stompy	if i talk too much feel free to tell me to shut up, i have poor manners
2018-11-28 09:43:10	stompy	upon actually checking my public_html folder, i see my index page is a php file, which made my question about php earlier totally redundant. lol
2018-11-28 09:44:08	stompy	anarchmellow: i do have an actual question now

2018-11-28 09:53:58	 *	jan6| brb, eating for a bit
2018-11-28 09:53:58	stompy	my first computer was a macintosh LC II 68k running mac os 7
2018-11-28 09:54:20	stompy	i gave up on macs when os x came out, went to windows, then to debian linux around 05, been here ever since
2018-11-28 09:54:32	stompy	although i do keep windows 10 hidden away for when i get cravings to play resident evil 4
2018-11-28 09:55:38	stompy	my aunt worked at SCAD in georgia, savannah college of art and design, so my first computers were the ones they were throwing out, so i got a bunch of cool 68k and powermacs. i didnt really get into them until i discovered adobe photoshop 4.0 and resedit, and that you could emulate super nintendo games
2018-11-28 09:55:57	stompy	i also got to play with BeOS when it was an actual thing
2018-11-28 09:58:18	stompy	these days im the go to linux nerd for my friends, ive turned a bunch of people on to linux and bsd, and i do web design for free for my friends. i spent my 20s in the punk scene in my hometown and i would help them record and convert their music to digital, and get it online. then i started making websites
2018-11-28 09:58:20	stompy	so thats what i do
2018-11-28 10:00:04	stompy	my greatest love is actually recording music, but ive travelled all around the USA for the past five years so i generally only have a laptop to my name, but i have done some remastering work for friends. i dont feel too strongly about recording my own music, it feels better to do things for friends, so i do that in any way i can help
2018-11-28 10:01:04	stompy	anyways i think thats enough i just wanted to say hi and introduce myself and what i do
2018-11-28 10:03:53	npa	hiya stompy
2018-11-28 10:03:56	stompy	yo
2018-11-28 10:04:16	npa	thats a good hello/introduction
2018-11-28 10:04:22	stompy	lol i hope so
2018-11-28 10:04:26	+jan6|	that's the most in-depth introduction I've ever seen, lol
2018-11-28 10:04:27	stompy	i certainly took up enough lines
2018-11-28 10:04:35	anarchmellow	jan6|: yes indeed
2018-11-28 10:05:35	+jan6|	I'm just a LITERAL millenial, from thy year 20 with 2 0s, and lived in linux my whole life
2018-11-28 10:06:18	stompy	i get mad when people are condescending to our generation
2018-11-28 10:06:26	stompy	im 31 now but the kids i meet now are like
2018-11-28 10:06:47	stompy	so much better with empathy and emotion
2018-11-28 10:06:49	+jan6|	damn you, whoever called PREMILLENIUM PEOPLE MILLENIALS
2018-11-28 10:06:54	stompy	kids dont bully each other like they used to
2018-11-28 10:07:05	stompy	its because of the internet
2018-11-28 10:07:19	stompy	its made them realize theres a person on the other side of the screen, and it makes them think about that in real life
2018-11-28 10:07:20	+jan6|	they bully in the net instead ;p
2018-11-28 10:07:28	stompy	not as much as they would have
2018-11-28 10:07:37	+jan6|	that's true
2018-11-28 10:07:39	stompy	if facebook was around in 1992 it would have been much much worse
2018-11-28 10:07:46	stompy	i quite like the youth of america today
2018-11-28 10:08:03	stompy	not crazy about their rap music but i grew up in the 90s so im arrogant
2018-11-28 10:08:10	+jan6|	eeeh, possibly
2018-11-28 10:08:11	stompy	and i think their punk rock is terrible
2018-11-28 10:08:18	stompy	and there seem to be no goths anymore
2018-11-28 10:08:22	stompy	what the hell happened there
2018-11-28 10:08:29	stompy	but if theyre kinder in general ill give it a pass
2018-11-28 10:08:37	+jan6|	I'm from the 00 and I hate the bass punch
2018-11-28 10:09:00	stompy	well
2018-11-28 10:09:06	+jan6|	70/80/90s music is so much better than the "music" nowdays
2018-11-28 10:09:06	stompy	ill admit im too old to get EDM
2018-11-28 10:09:28	stompy	when i wanna get hype on music ill listen to the wipers or the jesus lizard or public enemy
2018-11-28 10:09:33	stompy	but im in my 30s, whatever
2018-11-28 10:09:50	stompy	i SHOULDNT get it
2018-11-28 10:10:02	stompy	new music for kids, i shouldnt get it
2018-11-28 10:10:07	stompy	it isnt made for me
2018-11-28 10:10:10	+jan6|	now the music is just "crank up da bass and who cares about the rest, just drown out your thoughts"
2018-11-28 10:10:19	stompy	but i remember being in high school
2018-11-28 10:10:27	stompy	and thinking the cure and the cardiacs were the coolest bands ever
2018-11-28 10:10:33	stompy	maybe im old and lame
2018-11-28 10:10:58	stompy	i dont like the laziness in rap lyrics, to be honest
2018-11-28 10:11:09	stompy	i dont mind not getting the music
2018-11-28 10:11:13	stompy	but where are the LYRICS
2018-11-28 10:11:39	+jan6|	heavy metal's fine and nice, but punchy bass with basically no music and terrible lyrics is the death of me
2018-11-28 10:11:57	stompy	depends on the metal
2018-11-28 10:12:21	stompy	but this was before metalcore in my days
2018-11-28 10:12:28	+jan6|	y'know, the good kind
2018-11-28 10:12:47	stompy	whats the good kind to you
2018-11-28 10:13:20	+jan6|	Iron Maiden and stuff

2018-11-28 10:13:52	stompy	my favorite metal album was a band called sleepytime gorilla museum

2018-11-28 11:31:34	+jan6|	Generation Z or Gen Z, also known by a number of other names is the demographic cohort after the Millennials (Generation Y). There is no precise date for when Generation Z begins, but demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to mid-2000s as a starting birth years. There is little consensus regarding ending birth years. 
2018-11-28 11:32:07	+jan6|	so I'd be pretty surely thrown into the Zorro genreation
2018-11-28 11:32:21	+jan6|	speaking of which, does anybody here knows of Zorro?

2018-11-28 13:35:27	mushmouth	cdmnky: ben apparently didn't know about the string that auto refreshes mutt
2018-11-28 13:35:37	mushmouth	so i asked him to put it in the default client
2018-11-28 13:35:55	cdmnky	there's a string that auto refreshes mutt?
2018-11-28 13:36:01	mushmouth	yup
2018-11-28 13:36:17	cdmnky	not that it'd work for me, 'cause I have to manually refresh offlineimap anyway
2018-11-28 13:37:24	mushmouth	well you could probably setup a cron for offlineimap
2018-11-28 13:37:29	mushmouth	then auto refresh mutt
2018-11-28 13:38:23	cdmnky	I know there's a systemd service, but I never got it to work
2018-11-28 13:41:28	mushmouth	i'd jut use normal cron
2018-11-28 13:50:58	ubergeek	mushmouth: not exactly what you asked for, but there is a script now on yourtilde:/home/ubergeek/bin/www2email that takes a single arg - the url you want, and it emails it to you
2018-11-28 13:51:19	ubergeek	there are probably bugs with pages that use url args
2018-11-28 13:51:22	mushmouth	ubergeek: kind of like google alerts
2018-11-28 13:51:44	ubergeek	Maybe?
2018-11-28 13:51:54	mushmouth	like how google alerts is able to 
2018-11-28 13:52:02	mushmouth	send a keyword to your email
2018-11-28 13:55:13	ubergeek	I'll need an inbox to watch in order to do a email request --> get file --> reply with content stuff, but that wouldn't be to entirely difficult, even in bash
2018-11-28 13:55:35	mushmouth	i was thinking like
2018-11-28 13:55:42	mushmouth	rms script would work
2018-11-28 13:55:48	mushmouth	but it seems to complicated
2018-11-28 13:55:57	mushmouth	plus perl
2018-11-28 13:56:52	ubergeek	I am unable to find his daemon
2018-11-28 13:57:03	ubergeek	or else I would have just grabbed it :)

2018-11-28 13:57:22	mushmouth	you ask and you shall get it :P
2018-11-28 13:59:00	cdmnky	TIL gophernicus lets you use the '=' datatype to run shell scripts
2018-11-28 13:59:29	mushmouth	ubergeek: it perl though. but not that hard to read the syntax
2018-11-28 14:00:05	ubergeek	... giving it a look-over
2018-11-28 14:01:12	mushmouth	ubergeek: i think you need sudo for it to work
2018-11-28 14:01:24	ubergeek	probably
2018-11-28 14:01:34	ubergeek	or a user systemd.unit
2018-11-28 14:01:40	mushmouth	yeah

2018-11-28 14:07:40	~ben	glad you made it here :)
2018-11-28 14:07:42	ubergeek	it was a lot of scrollback...
2018-11-28 14:08:00	~ben	that was definitely one of the best introductions i've seen
2018-11-28 14:08:10	~ben	`=` datatype is great
2018-11-28 14:08:23	 *	cdmnky doesn't read more than 10-15 lines of scrollback tbh

2018-11-28 14:10:22	~ben	what keys?
2018-11-28 14:10:24	mushmouth	i have a different opinion of old keyboards now
2018-11-28 14:10:26	mushmouth	like scrollock
2018-11-28 14:10:38	mushmouth	right click menu key
2018-11-28 14:10:42	ubergeek	main reason I hate Mac keyboards...
2018-11-28 14:10:52	ubergeek	I have yet to figure out how to actually use "ALT"
2018-11-28 14:11:12	ubergeek	I am hurting for the lack of ALT+.
2018-11-28 14:11:38	mushmouth	i actually like the command key ubergeek 
2018-11-28 14:11:43	mushmouth	it nicer then os key
2018-11-28 14:11:45	mushmouth	or windows
2018-11-28 14:11:52	ubergeek	the command key doesn't solve "Alt"
2018-11-28 14:11:56	mushmouth	no i know
2018-11-28 14:11:57	TildeBot	no u infinity mushmouth
2018-11-28 14:12:00	mushmouth	but i like how it looks
2018-11-28 14:12:15	ubergeek	I'm "meh" about how it a keycap looks tbh
2018-11-28 14:12:35	mushmouth	im pretty anal about most things even keyboards
2018-11-28 14:12:39	ubergeek	I recall when it was just a black square, called "Meta" lol
2018-11-28 14:12:39	cdmnky	I thought Option was the mac equivalent of alt
2018-11-28 14:12:44	ubergeek	It is.
2018-11-28 14:12:45	mushmouth	i have a unicomp keyboard
2018-11-28 14:13:00	ubergeek	ANd option doesn't provide "Alt"
2018-11-28 14:13:07	mushmouth	i been using the same one for 3+ years
2018-11-28 14:13:09	ubergeek	mushmouth: same here.  A PC122
2018-11-28 14:13:12	mushmouth	good build quality
2018-11-28 14:13:23	cdmnky	neat
2018-11-28 14:13:28	ubergeek	I like the PC122 unicomp, because it doubles as a bludgeoning weapon
2018-11-28 14:13:45	mushmouth	i like the trackball they added to the server rack keyboards
2018-11-28 14:13:54	ubergeek	I dropped it on my desk once, and it broke my desk :P
2018-11-28 14:13:57	mushmouth	i'd buy one but it too much
2018-11-28 14:14:16	 *	cdmnky sits here with his cheap chinese redragon keyboard
2018-11-28 14:14:17	ubergeek	yeah, they're not cheap, but oh gods, they feel and sound so great.

2018-11-28 14:20:11	ubergeek	If the trackball works for you, I'd say go for it.  Could never get used to them
2018-11-28 14:20:14	cdmnky	if only i had a desk big enough for this lol
2018-11-28 14:20:21	+jan6	helo

2018-11-28 14:39:39	+jan6	if $subject == "webbot" then curl "$content"|sendmail
2018-11-28 14:39:48	+jan6	ez pz

2018-11-28 14:40:29	mushmouth	:D
2018-11-28 14:41:19	+jan6	actually better to do the opposite I guess, if content = webbot OR subject = http(s)?\:// then curl subject|sendmail
2018-11-28 14:41:37	mushmouth	curl has better support i find for http stuff
2018-11-28 14:41:49	+jan6	better than what?
2018-11-28 14:41:56	mushmouth	wget
2018-11-28 14:42:01	+jan6	how so?
2018-11-28 14:42:08	mushmouth	like it supports gopher for instant
2018-11-28 14:42:12	mushmouth	wget does not i believe
2018-11-28 14:42:17	+jan6	they both literally just download the url
2018-11-28 14:42:30	+jan6	curl to stdout wget to file

2018-11-28 14:42:50	~ben	actually not
2018-11-28 14:42:54	mushmouth	nah ben is our sugar daddy
2018-11-28 14:42:54	~ben	i just like registering them
2018-11-28 14:42:55	+jan6	curl is an extra package to install in most cases though, nowadays
2018-11-28 14:42:59	~ben	not on bsd
2018-11-28 14:43:13	~tomasino	curl is the bawse
2018-11-28 14:43:22	+jan6	also ED is not the standard editor anymore FOR SOME REASON
2018-11-28 14:43:28	+jan6	grr
2018-11-28 14:43:37	mushmouth	there a reason it not the standard editor? :P
2018-11-28 14:43:40	+jan6	it takes like, KILOBYTES of space
2018-11-28 14:43:40	~ben	cause it's not practical

2018-11-28 18:27:11	cdmnky	too bad the people on SDF who use gopher to browse won't see anything but a few random lines that decided to render
2018-11-28 18:27:20	~ben	gcc something.c -o no_u
2018-11-28 18:27:43	cdmnky	it's weird, there's no explanation to it. it only seems to work with files called gophermap
2018-11-28 18:28:33	+jan6	I'd assume it just wants files in he same dir as gophermap?
2018-11-28 18:29:32	cdmnky	it's reading the file itself, just not rendering it properly like all the other clients

2018-11-28 21:06:25	sebboh	amcclure: are you wanting to rent physical servers in somebody else's datacenter, or buy physical servers to wire up in somebody else's datacenter, or buy physical servers to use in your home/office?
2018-11-28 21:07:28	~ben	those are all very different use cases
2018-11-28 21:07:56	cdmnky	tomasino: my gophermaps aren't rendering properly with SDF's 'gopher' command (reading scrollback rn)
2018-11-28 21:08:16	sebboh	I get almost all my PCs from dumpsters.  When college kids move out of their dorms twice a year, there's always some kid who throws out their "dead" gaming rig.  So far, it must have always been a software problem, because I've never found a hardware problem with any of them...  Nor did I ever try to boot their windows.  Out of respect for the dead, I don't datasnoop.
2018-11-28 21:08:21	cdmnky	barely made it out of that lab. doing two labs in one week to catch up is annoying
2018-11-28 21:08:59	amcclure	sebboh: this is for a shell provider and web host
2018-11-28 21:09:11	~tomasino	sdf's gopher is ancient
2018-11-28 21:09:28	sebboh	btw dead gaming rigs make amazing linux machines.  multiple gigs of ram, fast CPUs... :)  
2018-11-28 21:09:43	cdmnky	my phlogs work fine on vf1, lynx and the html proxy so i think it's fine
2018-11-28 21:09:48	~tomasino	im on phone still, but when i get back i can help you debug
2018-11-28 21:10:05	~tomasino	oh good
2018-11-28 21:10:11	amcclure	would a gaming rig work
2018-11-28 21:10:15	amcclure	lol
2018-11-28 21:10:15	sebboh	amcclure: a shell provider and web host.  Ok, do you want to rent or buy?
2018-11-28 21:10:21	amcclure	probably buy
2018-11-28 21:10:31	sebboh	ok use it at home or in a datacenter?
2018-11-28 21:11:47	amcclure	which would be better
2018-11-28 21:12:35	~ben	i wouldn't recommend hosting at home
2018-11-28 21:12:43	~ben	you could colocate somewhere
2018-11-28 21:12:44	amcclure	I don't really want to do that anymore lol
2018-11-28 21:12:59	~ben	it'd still be cheaper to rent a dedi from somewhere like ovh or hetzner
2018-11-28 21:13:07	bumbaklat	ddos is fun
2018-11-28 21:13:32	 *	sebboh wonders if he's in the wrong channel

2018-11-28 21:15:16	amcclure	how would I host my own server in a datacenter lol
2018-11-28 21:15:22	~ben	look up colocation
2018-11-28 21:16:57	mushmouth	colocation is really expensive
2018-11-28 21:17:07	amcclure	everywhere?
2018-11-28 21:19:49	~ben	yeah usually
2018-11-28 21:20:12	~ben	owning your own hardware is expensive both in money and time
2018-11-28 21:20:35	~ben	if you don't have a particular reason to not rent a dedi, that's definitely what i'd suggest
2018-11-28 21:20:53	cdmnky	it makes you wonder how people used to host their tiny web things at home
2018-11-28 21:22:32	~ben	keyword tiny
2018-11-28 21:22:54	~ben	but it doesn't sound like that's amcclure's use case
2018-11-28 21:23:24	cdmnky	that's the thing about the internet though, keeping things tiny
2018-11-28 21:23:34	cdmnky	s/thing/issue
2018-11-28 21:23:34	sedbot	<cdmnky> that's the issue about the internet though, keeping things tiny
2018-11-28 21:24:02	+aewens	amcclure: You can also talk to a local college/university, a lot of them have datacenters with empty rack space.
2018-11-28 21:25:16	amcclure	I'd do that but idrk who I would contact though
2018-11-28 21:26:10	~ben	find it out
2018-11-28 21:26:12	~ben	lol
2018-11-28 21:26:13	+jan6	just ask the one who's listed as the IT person whether they know who you should talk to in that matter
2018-11-28 21:26:50	amcclure	the only real problem with them is they love using WINDOWS SERVER for some reason or another
2018-11-28 21:27:25	amcclure	so idk if they'd like it if I would want to use Debian
2018-11-28 21:27:49	~ben	your school runs windows server for the cs dept?

2018-11-28 22:09:20	giacomo	we can stick to English... my English sucks, but I have an UK keyboard... so... :-)
2018-11-28 22:09:33	~tomasino	the system we have is mostly a holdover from the Chaledaens, who were in power in their age for less than a single generation
2018-11-28 22:09:33	+aewens	cdmnky: You can take your metric hogwash elsewhere
2018-11-28 22:10:04	~tomasino	thanks, giacomo. My italian was learned in high school despite being an italian citizen. I've never lived in Italy (yet)
2018-11-28 22:10:12	cdmnky	the Chaledaens sound like the "diplomats of the week" in TNG
2018-11-28 22:10:29	+aewens	Also, making a year be less than ~365 days is asking for madness as the seasons slowly drift from their designated months
2018-11-28 22:10:47	~tomasino	the History of Mathematics vol 1 has some incredible stuff
2018-11-28 22:11:10	giacomo	tomasino: where are you from?
2018-11-28 22:11:38	~tomasino	United states, for another 7 months. Then the plan is to emmigrate to Iceland
2018-11-28 22:11:45	~ben	good call
2018-11-28 22:11:48	~ben	get out while you can
2018-11-28 22:11:49	+jan6	good call indeed
2018-11-28 22:12:01	+jan6	let's all go to ice and greenland
2018-11-28 22:12:14	~ben	i bet iceland is warmer than here tbh
2018-11-28 22:12:16	~tomasino	almost every civilization on earth, no matter how disconnected, used the radix of their standard base system as a synonym for "many"
2018-11-28 22:12:24	+jan6	radix?
2018-11-28 22:12:58	~tomasino	early europeans had a base 20 system in place for most of pre-history, which is why "score" and its french equivalent still can be used that way
2018-11-28 22:13:05	~tomasino	radix is the base number of your system
2018-11-28 22:13:11	~tomasino	so base 10 is radix of 10
2018-11-28 22:13:14	-->	Fessus (Fessus@198.144.189.220) has joined #meta
2018-11-28 22:13:23	~tomasino	but egyptians were base 60
2018-11-28 22:13:28	~tomasino	and thus 60 was their word for many
2018-11-28 22:13:55	~tomasino	agrecultural civilizations tended to develop larger radixes
2018-11-28 22:14:04	~tomasino	hunter gatherers rarely had a radix over 5
2018-11-28 22:14:04	+jan6	10 is not the word of many in any language afaik
2018-11-28 22:14:25	~tomasino	10 was relatively unpopular as a radix until later history
2018-11-28 22:14:37	~tomasino	2, 5, 4, 3, 20, 40, 60
2018-11-28 22:14:51	~tomasino	10 grew to dominate, but it took a while
2018-11-28 22:15:08	+aewens	tomasino: If you look at how the human mind quickly recognizes clusters of objects, once it goes about 3 or 4 we stop immediately knowing how many are in the group at a glance.
2018-11-28 22:15:25	~tomasino	i believe 5 is the max for object clustering
2018-11-28 22:15:30	~tomasino	but yeah
2018-11-28 22:15:41	~tomasino	fives and fives of things, guys!
2018-11-28 22:16:00	~ben	12 like dozens
2018-11-28 22:16:02	~ben	oh
2018-11-28 22:16:04	~ben	oops
2018-11-28 22:16:18	~ben	that's called subitizing
2018-11-28 22:16:28	dozens	o/
2018-11-28 22:16:31	~ben	<3
2018-11-28 22:16:47	+aewens	So we should totally use a base 4 system for everything. Work our system to be optimized for our lowest common denominators.
2018-11-28 22:16:53	~ben	i bet subitizing has etymology coming from subito
2018-11-28 22:17:13	~ben	dozenal is a reasonable system
2018-11-28 22:17:25	dozens	more than reasonable!
2018-11-28 22:17:33	dozens	it's pretty much the MOST reasonable
2018-11-28 22:17:52	+jan6	17:16:47           +aewens | So we should totally use a base 4 system for everything.
2018-11-28 22:18:01	+jan6	I'd say 3 for some things
2018-11-28 22:18:03	+jan6	but yeah
2018-11-28 22:18:19	+jan6	also there's entire videos on how good dozenal IS
2018-11-28 22:18:32	dozens	i count in duodecimal pretty much all the time. you have twelve finger bones on each hand. i run my thumb over them and count by the dozen
2018-11-28 22:18:33	+jan6	supposedly is real good and stuff
2018-11-28 22:19:36	~ben	but when you get to a dozen dozens it starts to get gross
2018-11-28 22:19:48	~tomasino	so yeah, if you were really interested in this conversation and didn't roll your eyes, i HIGHLY recommend the 2 volume "History of Mathematics" by D.E. Smith

2018-11-28 22:23:27	+aewens	Using base12 we could count using one hand, do simple math (e.g. 1/3) easier, and make it easier for the hoi polloi to use it in their daily life... but trying to get all of us to get over the arabiac number system using base10 will never happen.

2018-11-28 22:28:08	~tomasino	at ftw
2018-11-28 22:28:14	giacomo	I can't really understand people saying "will never happen"
2018-11-28 22:28:53	+aewens	ben: But someone needs to keep that computer alive for hundreds/thousands of years so `at` will work.
2018-11-28 22:28:56	~ben	heh; saw your phlog tomasino 
2018-11-28 22:29:06	~ben	aewens: the ultimate uptime challenge
2018-11-28 22:29:36	~ben	what's flying the ship while you're asleep anyways?
2018-11-28 22:29:54	+aewens	giacomo: It's a statistical thing for why I pick "will never happen". But also in this case I want to be proven wrong, and the best way to coerce the universe to do that is saying it won't happen.
2018-11-28 22:30:09	+aewens	ben: Wait, it's on a ship now?
2018-11-28 22:30:50	~ben	i thought the context was space travel
2018-11-28 22:31:02	~ben	were you talking about something else?
2018-11-28 22:31:05	~tomasino	all teh more reason our ships travelling in deep space will be running ancient, safe systems

2018-11-28 22:32:18	~tomasino	nah, i hijacked us to cosmic.voyage
2018-11-28 22:32:19	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-28 22:32:20	murii	basically it's like XML, JSON and whatever else but in a readable format, this applies to the client and to the programmer (the one who parses)
2018-11-28 22:32:49	~tomasino	anyone check out log(1) manpage yet?
2018-11-28 22:33:08	giacomo	aewens: so many people told me "opt-in JS will never happen!" while this is the only thing it can happen
2018-11-28 22:33:28	+aewens	murii: Any particular reason for the hard-coded max values?
2018-11-28 22:33:29	giacomo	but I guess they don't want this to happen...
2018-11-28 22:34:09	+aewens	giacomo: Having people use javascript is much easier to do than forcing all people alive to stop thinking in base10 and start thinking in base12.
2018-11-28 22:34:15	~ben	murii: s/wrote/written/
2018-11-28 22:34:27	+aewens	One happened to people, the other involves *changing* how people think.
2018-11-28 22:34:39	murii	aewens: will be fixed at some point :)
2018-11-28 22:34:41	murii	ben: thanks
2018-11-28 22:34:43	giacomo	I totally agree aewens 
2018-11-28 22:34:57	~ben	given the current state of the web, opt-in js will never happen
2018-11-28 22:35:15	~ben	there'd have to be a fundamental shift
2018-11-28 22:35:16	+jan6	that's current state
2018-11-28 22:35:39	+aewens	I find any project that started with "let's make everyone think differently" do not tend to end well. They happen sometimes, but only for broad things that were kinda obvious to begin with (e.g. slavery is bad)
2018-11-28 22:35:45	giacomo	so according to aewens, ben is challenging the universe
2018-11-28 22:36:00	+aewens	giacomo: Yes, he is
2018-11-28 22:36:14	~tomasino	ben is very challenging
2018-11-28 22:36:37	~ben	there are too many commercial interests in keeping js opt-out

2018-11-28 23:07:50	+aewens	I have it on my book shelf with the means to one day consume all of it, I've only read about 20 pages in. Right now I'm working through Randall Monroe's "What If", which most of you know as "the guy who does XKCD".
2018-11-28 23:08:56	+aewens	And those 20 pages were what I read after I purchased the book since our next stop was a clothes store and I needed something to do while my wife tried on stuff.
2018-11-28 23:17:57	sebboh	I got lost around the Church Numerals.  Though, at this point, I guess I know a little more about those?
2018-11-28 23:19:47	sebboh	I bought Monroe's Thing Explainer or something like that for a friend, only got to read a bit of it before it disappeared from his livingroom.
2018-11-28 23:21:08	sebboh	I didn't care for it, actually.  The 10,000 word limit was mechanical and contrived *and* he broke it sometimes.  Or 1,000 or whatever it was
2018-11-28 23:37:25	sebboh	anybody know how to reach tildespark since ddns turned off free accounts and presumably that's why their hostname disappeared?
2018-11-28 23:41:48	~deepend	not sure if tildespark stil exists.. pretty sure that was mhj's tilde if i remember correctly
2018-11-28 23:54:49	giacomo	jan6: what do you mean by "a subshell situation"? I do not know much shell scripting
2018-11-28 23:58:40	~ben	mhj: any plans with tildespark?
2018-11-29 00:03:09	sebboh	giacomo: when you issue something like echo $foo at the prompt (like, if you paste it) then the $foo gets "expanded" (the value is filled in) in your current shell.  If you run ./bar.sh and it contains echo $foo.. then foo gets expanded in the subshell, which won't ever have the exact same environment (that's all the variables and their values) as the parent shell.
2018-11-29 00:03:56	sebboh	run `file <your script>` .. what does file(1) say your script file is?
2018-11-29 00:12:52	giacomo	build.sh: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable
2018-11-29 00:13:15	giacomo	sorry the delay sebboh I'm trying to figure out this shit
2018-11-29 00:13:37	giacomo	SH is also /bin/bash
2018-11-29 00:16:56	sebboh	ok.  good, it does NOT say POSIX shell script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators :)
2018-11-29 00:17:16	sebboh	s/POSIX/Bourne-Again/
2018-11-29 00:17:16	sedbot	<sebboh> ok.  good, it does NOT say Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators :)
2018-11-29 00:20:48	giacomo	doesn't seem a CRLF problem
2018-11-29 01:12:23	giacomo	got it... a warning was making the script fails
2018-11-29 01:32:00	~ben	nice
2018-11-29 01:39:27	giacomo	I have no idea why it don't fail when executed interactively...
2018-11-29 01:49:32	~tomasino	cdmnky: your i lines don't have the trailing tabs and server info. probably why the old gopher client is crying
2018-11-29 01:50:07	cdmnky	oof
2018-11-29 01:50:18	~ben	that would do it
2018-11-29 01:50:42	cdmnky	lemme try adding them to the latest post and see if that does the trick
2018-11-29 01:54:18	cdmnky	well, more lines are showing up
2018-11-29 01:57:39	giacomo	time to sleep... good night!
2018-11-29 01:58:19	~ben	night!
2018-11-29 02:03:42	cdmnky	so it's i<text><\t>localhost</t>70
2018-11-29 02:04:02	cdmnky	s/\//\\
2018-11-29 02:04:03	sedbot	<cdmnky> so it's i<text><\t>localhost<\t>70
2018-11-29 02:15:29	cdmnky	some lines don't show up even with all that going on for some reason. I can't tell what pattern is causing this
2018-11-29 02:24:45	SinaCutie	Hi hi!
2018-11-29 02:26:14	~ben	yo SinaCutie how goes it
2018-11-29 02:26:31	ubergeek	heyo SinaCutie 
2018-11-29 02:26:42	SinaCutie	Doing well. Just woke up so a little groggy. x'D
2018-11-29 02:26:50	~ben	heh nice
2018-11-29 02:27:21	SinaCutie	I guess. It's 4.30am.
2018-11-29 02:27:24	SinaCutie	lmao
2018-11-29 02:27:35	ubergeek	sounds like my normal wake-up time :)
2018-11-29 02:27:44	SinaCutie	I usually wake up between now and 6am.
2018-11-29 02:27:51	~ben	jeez that's early
2018-11-29 02:28:14	~ben	i wake up between 8:15 and 8:30, roll out of bed and get to work by 9
2018-11-29 02:28:17	SinaCutie	xD
2018-11-29 02:28:28	~ben	usually stay up too late tho :P
2018-11-29 02:28:37	SinaCutie	The best part, ben, is that I don't out out to work. So I could sleep in, by my body is like, "haha nope"
2018-11-29 02:28:46	~ben	:o
2018-11-29 02:28:48	~ben	that's insane
2018-11-29 02:28:59	~ben	if i didn't set an alarm i would literally sleep all day
2018-11-29 02:29:17	<--	stompy (peachfuzz@ip68-13-254-74.ok.ok.cox.net) has quit (quit: when i leave, come together like buttcheeks)
2018-11-29 02:29:43	SinaCutie	I used to be like that.
2018-11-29 02:29:45	ubergeek	yeah, up at 4:30, hygeine done by 5, cup of coffee #1 done by 5:15, wake up everyone else for school at 5:30, and then out the door at 6 
2018-11-29 02:30:06	SinaCutie	Hee!
2018-11-29 02:31:22	SinaCutie	Speaking of coffee, I must go grind me some beans, brb!
2018-11-29 02:32:55	ubergeek	Don't grind too fine!
2018-11-29 02:33:04	~ben	i'm lazy and use a keurig :s
2018-11-29 02:33:50	~tomasino	i just ground a cup
2018-11-29 02:33:58	~tomasino	ultra-fine in my aeropress
2018-11-29 02:34:01	~tomasino	it's the yums
2018-11-29 02:34:06	~tomasino	BE JEALOUS!
2018-11-29 02:34:29	ubergeek	I don't grind. Folgers into a french press
2018-11-29 02:35:35	cdmnky	the old sdf gopher client is an enigma
2018-11-29 02:36:38	~tomasino	it's poop
2018-11-29 02:36:40	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-29 02:37:17	SinaCutie	I grind my own beans and use a french press
2018-11-29 02:39:06	SinaCutie	Manual grinding is <3
2018-11-29 02:39:24	npa	i have one of those electrical burr grinders
2018-11-29 02:39:34	npa	lets you set the granularity etc, got it as a present
2018-11-29 02:39:56	~tomasino	sounds naught, sina
2018-11-29 02:40:09	~tomasino	s/ght/ghty/g
2018-11-29 02:40:09	sedbot	<tomasino> sounds naughty, sina
2018-11-29 02:40:13	cdmnky	although, it's consistent. it seems to display only every other line
2018-11-29 02:40:18	cdmnky	this is strange
2018-11-29 02:40:36	~tomasino	try adding the \tserver\tport at the end of a couple lines in a row as a test
2018-11-29 02:40:41	~tomasino	see if they display properly
2018-11-29 02:41:19	~tomasino	i've got a hario hand grinder. it's so cute and i love it
2018-11-29 02:41:23	cdmnky	tomasino: i put \tlocalhost\t70 at the end of every line, on the latest post anyway
2018-11-29 02:42:11	SinaCutie	That too, tomasino
2018-11-29 02:42:30	~tomasino	hrm, you did, didn't you
2018-11-29 02:42:33	~tomasino	well, localhost
2018-11-29 02:42:39	~tomasino	i don't think it matters what it is
2018-11-29 02:43:02	~tomasino	ahh well
2018-11-29 02:43:10	~tomasino	sucks be to sdf gopher client
2018-11-29 02:43:17	~tomasino	does gopher.black show up in it?
2018-11-29 02:44:07	~ben	there is a debian package called gopher
2018-11-29 02:44:13	~ben	i was not aware of that until today
2018-11-29 02:44:20	~tomasino	what is it?
2018-11-29 02:44:59	~ben	a gopher client
2018-11-29 02:45:01	~ben	lol
2018-11-29 02:45:11	~ben	it's installed on ~team if you'd like to take it for a spin
2018-11-29 02:45:31	cdmnky	tomasino: it does, although one or two lines is always staggered back by one space for some reason
2018-11-29 02:45:48	~tomasino	the 2nd or third line down from the top?
2018-11-29 02:46:22	~tomasino	yeah, ben, that's the UMN gopher client
2018-11-29 02:46:26	~tomasino	wildly out of date
2018-11-29 02:46:45	~tomasino	i can't believe there's a package still
2018-11-29 02:47:00	~ben	maybe i should uninstall and make a tiny little script to just run lynx gopher://$1
2018-11-29 02:47:23	cdmnky	here's a screenshot https://ttm.sh/bj.png 
2018-11-29 02:47:44	cdmnky	also idk why I can't use tmux on sdf, I have to use it locally and run 3 different ssh sessions lol
2018-11-29 02:48:22	~tomasino	nah, ben.. this is great
2018-11-29 02:48:22	~ben	are you metaarpa on sdf?
2018-11-29 02:48:27	~ben	lol ok
2018-11-29 02:48:29	cdmnky	nope
2018-11-29 02:48:34	~tomasino	that's why
2018-11-29 02:48:35	~ben	pretty sure you need meta for tmux
2018-11-29 02:48:38	~tomasino	tmux is restricted to meta
2018-11-29 02:48:38	~ben	git too
2018-11-29 02:48:47	~tomasino	ben, your gopher renders gopher.black perfectly
2018-11-29 02:48:53	~ben	lol
2018-11-29 02:48:54	~tomasino	the misalignment must be on SDF's end
2018-11-29 02:49:02	~tomasino	sdf lynx does that to me too sometimes
2018-11-29 02:49:04	~ben	sdf is running gophernicus/101
2018-11-29 02:49:05	~tomasino	no idea what they're doing
2018-11-29 02:49:06	TildeBot	no u infinity tomasino
2018-11-29 02:49:07	~ben	however old that is
2018-11-29 02:49:36	cdmnky	meanwhile I can't run gopher for some reason because of that buffer overflow bug lol
2018-11-29 02:49:46	SinaCutie	Womp
2018-11-29 02:49:46	~tomasino	1995-ish?
2018-11-29 02:50:57	cdmnky	jeez, it's almost 10. i better go and take a shower
2018-11-29 02:51:11	SinaCutie	Good luck!
2018-11-29 02:51:36	 *	cdmnky grabs a screwdriver and a flashlight
2018-11-29 02:52:02	cdmnky	stupid hot water knob broke off and of course there isn't a light in there
2018-11-29 02:52:11	SinaCutie	o:
2018-11-29 02:52:43	~tomasino	i thought he had a really "special" way of showering
2018-11-29 02:52:45	cdmnky	it didn't really break off, but the knob doesn't turn the screw, and I had to take the little plastic bit off and use a screwdriver
2018-11-29 02:52:47	~ben	"better shower now" 
2018-11-29 02:52:53	SinaCutie	So did I tomasino
2018-11-29 02:52:53	~ben	>grabs screwdriver and flashlight
2018-11-29 02:52:59	~ben	qotd
2018-11-29 02:53:05	SinaCutie	I was jokingly "good lucking" but then this.
2018-11-29 02:53:09	cdmnky	lol
2018-11-29 02:53:53	cdmnky	i also probably have to grab a bucket too since the water hasn't been draining lately, and the nozzle drips a bit
2018-11-29 02:54:31	cdmnky	the toilet also doesn't flush either
2018-11-29 02:54:39	cdmnky	at this point, I just need a new bathroom
2018-11-29 02:54:47	SinaCutie	Yes.
2018-11-29 02:54:59	~tomasino	yeah, that's a problem
2018-11-29 02:55:14	~tomasino	you're nearly at "i'll just take a jump in the lake to clean off" territory
2018-11-29 02:55:45	cdmnky	i got used to it. the draining issue just started, but the bathroom's been like that for years tbh
2018-11-29 02:55:47	SinaCutie	I misread this as "dump" and I feel dirty.
2018-11-29 02:56:26	cdmnky	i keep telling my mother "have the landlord fix it" but she just gets really defensive about it and snaps
2018-11-29 02:56:54	~ben	my place has enough water pressure for one tap to be on at a time
2018-11-29 02:57:05	cdmnky	oof
2018-11-29 02:57:12	~ben	so if you try to get a glass of water while someone's in the shower it basically stops until they're done
2018-11-29 02:57:18	SinaCutie	Yikes
2018-11-29 02:57:25	~ben	do NOT try to run laundry or the dishwasher than then get in the shower
2018-11-29 02:57:27	~ben	it's not fun
2018-11-29 02:57:38	~tomasino	haha, take a dump in the lake, why dontcha
2018-11-29 02:57:44	~ben	it's not that far tb
2018-11-29 02:57:46	~ben	s/$/h
2018-11-29 02:57:46	sedbot	<ben> it's not that far tbh
2018-11-29 02:58:01	~ben	it is Very Cold right now though
2018-11-29 02:58:09	~tomasino	cdmnky: do you live indoors?
2018-11-29 02:58:16	~ben	i've got lakes on both sides of me lol
2018-11-29 02:58:23	cdmnky	tomasino: yeah lol
2018-11-29 02:58:26	~tomasino	there's an ocean right there!
2018-11-29 02:58:28	 *	tomasino points
2018-11-29 02:58:41	~tomasino	maybe 200 ft from me
2018-11-29 02:59:10	cdmnky	there's a lake not too far from me. too bad it's full of milfoil and houses that were flooded when the lake was created
2018-11-29 02:59:29	SinaCutie	...
2018-11-29 02:59:43	cdmnky	i can't believe the town lol, back in the 1880's or something they just flooded out an entire neighborhood just to create dams for mills to run
2018-11-29 03:00:00	cdmnky	or maybe it was early 1900's
2018-11-29 03:00:02	~ben	lake michigan is like 3 blocks away
2018-11-29 03:00:18	SinaCutie	Holy balls.
2018-11-29 03:00:26	~ben	the waves are big enough to surf on some days
2018-11-29 03:00:50	 *	cdmnky kinda wishes he could live on the St. Lawrence so he could say his coordinates are 45N 75W
2018-11-29 03:01:01	~tomasino	you can just say that anyway
2018-11-29 03:01:04	SinaCutie	^
2018-11-29 03:01:21	cdmnky	i guess, but it's 15 miles off
2018-11-29 03:01:39	cdmnky	there's this sign on this one island saying "you're halfway between the equator and the north pole"
2018-11-29 03:02:07	~tomasino	i mean... from the moon you seem about halfway if i put a pin on you
2018-11-29 03:02:23	~tomasino	at some point you're just being nitpicky
2018-11-29 03:02:25	~tomasino	;)
2018-11-29 03:03:17	cdmnky	there's nothing interesting about the area other than toilet garden guy and the fact that nightmare on elm street was written
2018-11-29 03:03:33	cdmnky	the elm street is as creepy as in the movies lol
2018-11-29 03:03:37	~ben	lol that 45°N sign is like 15 minutes from me
2018-11-29 03:03:59	cdmnky	ben: how many of them are there lol
2018-11-29 03:04:04	~tomasino	are you two neigbors?
2018-11-29 03:04:23	cdmnky	tomasino: nah, i'm from NY, he's from east wisconsin
2018-11-29 03:04:36	~ben	wisco?!?!?
2018-11-29 03:04:40	~ben	why do you insult me so
2018-11-29 03:04:48	cdmnky	lol
2018-11-29 03:04:59	~ben	there's a sign on most major highways
2018-11-29 03:05:03	~ben	and some county roads
2018-11-29 03:05:08	~ben	for 45°N
2018-11-29 03:05:09	cdmnky	reminds me of that joke about south detroit being canada
2018-11-29 03:05:14	~ben	lol yes
2018-11-29 03:05:16	~ben	tru
2018-11-29 03:05:46	cdmnky	tfw the US had to buy your town from Canada in the 1790s so you aren't canadian
2018-11-29 03:06:33	cdmnky	I really aughta go visit canada again sometime, I've only been once
2018-11-29 03:07:35	 *	cdmnky has ptsd flashbacks of the hour and a half it took for us customs to run background checks on everyone on the bus
2018-11-29 03:07:54	SinaCutie	Eep
2018-11-29 03:08:12	npa	last time i got checked on the bus i got kicked off at 2am at the ukraine border
2018-11-29 03:08:26	SinaCutie	Oof
2018-11-29 03:08:49	cdmnky	canadian border guards were nice, they just checked that we all had consent from our parents and the proper ids, but us border guards came onto the bus wearing kevlar and sidearms asking us all questions
2018-11-29 03:09:16	~ben	US border is mean
2018-11-29 03:09:22	npa	wow, that seems overboard
2018-11-29 03:09:25	~ben	especially if you're not white
2018-11-29 03:09:25	SinaCutie	...dang
2018-11-29 03:09:32	 *	SinaCutie makes notes.

2018-11-29 03:09:45	~ben	i've never had an problems cause i'm a white dude
2018-11-29 03:09:48	cdmnky	they say CBP can't deny citizens the right to reenter, but they find an excuse to arrest you if you refuse to comply
2018-11-29 03:09:53	~tomasino	when i was in the navy i shared a barracks with their training facility
2018-11-29 03:09:57	~ben	but don't make any sudden moves
2018-11-29 03:10:01	~tomasino	we used to play around on their wet track

2018-11-29 15:49:59	cdmnky	ben: 2 years ago his conviction was revoked because the defense proved that the prosecution wasn't doing their job properly or something to avoid doing a retrial of the case
2018-11-29 15:50:36	cdmnky	or was it the original defense lawyer
2018-11-29 15:50:59	cdmnky	something about using the cell towers to prove his alibi at the time (which were really interesting)
2018-11-29 15:51:49	cdmnky	one of the things I did was try and triangulate his location with old cell tower data, which proved that he could've been anywhere in a large area at the time, and there was no way to really know
2018-11-29 15:52:29	cdmnky	either way, I don't want to fall into another rabbit hole lol, no matter how fascinating it is
2018-11-29 15:55:54	cdmnky	why did they have to have different "disk" and "disc"? is it really necessary to distinguish between magnets and lasers?

2018-11-29 17:36:15	+jan6|	if only it'd been google glass
2018-11-29 17:38:06	+jan6|	also apple's VP Greg Joswiak sounds as if he changed his name to be totally-not-anything-close-to-that-Wozniak-guy
2018-11-29 17:39:29	+aewens	I really wanted Google Glass to take off, but it did far too little, asked for far too much, and launched too softly with it's early adopter program thing.
2018-11-29 17:40:41	+aewens	My next big hope is for Intel's smart glasses they're making that draws images to the retina directly using a lazer. https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16966530/intel-vaunt-smart-glasses-announced-ar-video

2018-11-29 17:43:20	+jan6|	there's absolutely no way someone's gonna "accidentally" get one with too powerful lazers, which "accidentally" burn his retina
2018-11-29 17:44:07	+jan6|	also, lazers are zupposed to be called lasers, but Zs ze way!
2018-11-29 17:45:45	arne	thicc dicc
2018-11-29 17:47:33	+aewens	jan6|: I mean, I don't think those things have the "juice" to shoot powerful enough lasers to "accidentally" burn the retinas. At least not in a way that they can get approval to sell them with that possibility.
2018-11-29 17:48:10	+jan6|	yeah, that's why "accidentally" get one
2018-11-29 17:48:41	+jan6|	sure they won't be approved, but in 'murica, anything's possible
2018-11-29 17:49:40	+jan6|	in russia and china too, though I guess that'd be already a giveaway
2018-11-29 17:51:12	+aewens	Well, I certainly be one of the first to buy one, I'd wait for YouTube reviewers to test their eyeballs against it and grab it the next month after people have enough time to beta test it for me ;)
2018-11-29 17:54:37	+jan6|	sure, though I was more referring to quietly blinding people deemed to know too much, n stuff

2018-11-29 17:55:32	+aewens	From hacker news on this:
2018-11-29 17:55:34	+aewens	This would be cool to be paired up with a site using a Konami code. Do the code ("Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Select Start"), and it changes your stylesheet to use this. Hahah Would be fun!
2018-11-29 17:56:38	+jan6|	it IS cook
2018-11-29 17:56:45	+jan6|	s/.$/l
2018-11-29 17:56:45	sedbot	<jan6|> it IS cool
2018-11-29 17:56:57	+jan6|	indeed
2018-11-29 17:57:01	+jan6|	good idea
2018-11-29 17:58:43	+aewens	I might do this for my own website with the Konami code xD
2018-11-29 17:59:55	~ben	do it
2018-11-29 18:01:28	+aewens	Also, is anyone planning to do Advent of Code this year? https://adventofcode.com/2018
2018-11-29 18:01:29	TildeBot	Advent of Code 2018 
2018-11-29 18:01:33	~ben	i probably wil
2018-11-29 18:01:46	~ben	what languages are available?
2018-11-29 18:03:10	+aewens	I think it's like Project Euler where you can solve it with any language
2018-11-29 18:03:34	~ben	oh huh
2018-11-29 18:03:40	~ben	i haven't done it b4
2018-11-29 18:04:13	+aewens	Neither have I, but I'm planning to this year (granted, this is the first year I've heard of it)
2018-11-29 18:04:17	+jan6|	idk what that be
2018-11-29 18:04:38	+jan6|	I've heard the name tho
2018-11-29 18:04:51	+aewens	Do you know what an Advent Calendar is?
2018-11-29 18:05:03	+aewens	Think that, but with code puzzles

2018-11-29 18:08:08	+aewens	If you want an example, this is the Jupyter notebook from Peter Norvig's submission from 2016 http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb
2018-11-29 18:08:10	TildeBot	Jupyter Notebook Viewer https://bhh.sh/28q
2018-11-29 18:13:02	+aewens	Also, looks like Go is actually getting generics in Go 2 https://blog.golang.org/go2-here-we-come
2018-11-29 18:13:03	TildeBot	submit search https://bhh.sh/28r
2018-11-29 18:18:23	~ben	norvig's doc is super thorough
2018-11-29 18:24:39	mushmouth	aewens: i heard go is actually getting more massier
2018-11-29 18:25:15	~ben	massier as in bigger?
2018-11-29 18:25:21	~ben	ie more massive?
2018-11-29 18:25:24	mushmouth	like just the codebase is getting weird
2018-11-29 18:25:46	mushmouth	one of the pidgin devs i follow rw_grim
2018-11-29 18:25:47	~ben	have you looked at it?
2018-11-29 18:25:53	mushmouth	mention it to me
2018-11-29 18:26:02	mushmouth	nah not personally
2018-11-29 18:26:05	~ben	what do you want me to mention?
2018-11-29 18:26:05	mushmouth	but im focusing on asm so
2018-11-29 18:26:17	mushmouth	im saying rw_grim mentioned it to me
2018-11-29 18:26:20	~ben	ohhh
2018-11-29 18:26:22	mushmouth	the pidgin lead dev
2018-11-29 18:26:25	~ben	sorry i read that as a command
2018-11-29 18:26:29	mushmouth	ah no lol
2018-11-29 18:26:53	mushmouth	he the person who mentioned to me that it getting worse
2018-11-29 18:27:24	mushmouth	he streams on twitch
2018-11-29 18:27:48	mushmouth	https://bitbucket.org/rw_grim/convey/src he making this program which is neat
2018-11-29 18:27:50	TildeBot	 rw_grim / convey / source / &mdash; Bitbucket  https://bhh.sh/28s
2018-11-29 18:28:00	mushmouth	not perfect right now. a lot of bugs
2018-11-29 18:29:12	+aewens	The whole appeal of Go is that you can do scripting and low-level work in the same language that's highly/easily portable, and uses minimal syntax.
2018-11-29 18:29:57	~ben	https://13brane.net/rants/de-facto-closed-source/
2018-11-29 18:29:58	TildeBot	13brane.net https://bhh.sh/28t
2018-11-29 18:30:05	+aewens	So I can see why adding more to the language could take away the appeal, but I personally found working with it to be a bit laboreous with the lack of generics leading to lots of code duplication when making abstract frameworks.
2018-11-29 18:41:41	arne	advent of code
2018-11-29 18:41:44	arne	will do it in zig

2018-11-29 18:46:41	~ben	generics will be nice

2018-11-29 18:51:38	cdmnky	aewens: i'm re-listening to reply all now, and those early episodes were so short, the edited in ads are longer than the pod lol
2018-11-29 18:52:14	+aewens	cdmnky: Yeah, that's what I experienced when I listened to the whole backlog.
2018-11-29 18:52:36	~ben	re: all
2018-11-29 18:52:38	~ben	so good
2018-11-29 18:52:59	+aewens	For the first few episodes, since I had them on auto-play, I had trouble realizing when one began and ended with the constant ads.
2018-11-29 18:53:44	cdmnky	the ad break music helps a bit though. I de-facto skip 60 secs in to every podcast I listen to 'cause 90% of the time it's just an ad
2018-11-29 18:54:12	~ben	depends on the show
2018-11-29 18:54:22	~ben	i have custom start-skip times for some shows
2018-11-29 18:54:57	cdmnky	a few of the podcasts i listen to are just livestream archives, and i usually watch them live
2018-11-29 18:55:04	cdmnky	i.e. WAN Show
2018-11-29 18:55:34	~ben	a little harder to skip live audio
2018-11-29 18:56:24	+aewens	I just let them run, the podcasts are there to break up the monotony of work so even the ads help xD
2018-11-29 18:56:42	~ben	that's fair
2018-11-29 18:57:02	~ben	i usually have tons to catch up on so i listen on 1.2x speed and skip ads when i rember
2018-11-29 18:57:02	 *	cdmnky needs a music library for his ipod since it doesn't have network capabilities for radio streams
2018-11-29 18:57:07	arne	what if i make my os for RISC

2018-11-29 19:00:00	+aewens	Um, I think you mean GNU+arneix
2018-11-29 19:00:36	cdmnky	it could be arneBSD too

2018-11-29 20:54:30	~ben	how does fahrenheit makes sense?
2018-11-29 20:54:53	mushmouth	well
2018-11-29 20:55:05	mushmouth	0 = cold makes a lot more sense then like -1.1 something
2018-11-29 20:55:13	~ben	??
2018-11-29 20:55:25	mushmouth	it seems more resonable

2018-11-29 20:55:28	~ben	0 is cold in both
2018-11-29 20:55:57	mushmouth	the way C messures stuff doesn't make sense to mer

2018-11-29 21:15:54	mushmouth	all was paid for

2018-11-29 21:41:42	~ben	nice
2018-11-29 21:41:46	~ben	i'll have to queue that up
2018-11-29 21:53:39	sebboh	What's a hello internet?  I avoid web searching for non tech things at work.
2018-11-29 21:55:32	amcclure	what is hello internet
2018-11-29 21:55:41	kirch	I search for whatever pops into my head @ work ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2018-11-29 21:57:47	+aewens	sebboh: It's a podcast made by the guy who made Numberphile and CGP Grey.
2018-11-29 21:57:58	+aewens	https://www.hellointernet.fm/
2018-11-29 21:58:00	TildeBot	Hello Internet 
2018-11-29 21:58:56	+aewens	Since the two are YouTubers in the academic space, the podcast started around talking about YouTube and the academic portion of YouTube and slowly became a meta podcast about itself that created it's own culture.
2018-11-29 22:00:13	+aewens	For an example, in episode #113 they were on a road trip in America hiding metallic hotstoppers with their podcast's flag stamped on them so that their audience can try to find them.
2018-11-29 22:00:52	brendantcc_lounge	hey hi
2018-11-29 22:00:57	+aewens	hello
2018-11-29 22:01:07	brendantcc_lounge	aewens! WOT POPPIN
2018-11-29 22:01:26	brendantcc_lounge	dammit i hit capslock by accident sorry!
2018-11-29 22:01:28	sebboh	I conclude a hotstopper isn't a thing outside of that podcast world.
2018-11-29 22:02:38	+aewens	sebboh: Ever been to Starbucks and they put those plastic things in the lid to keep the drink from spilling? That's a hot stopper.
2018-11-29 22:03:24	+aewens	Image of one: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Hot_Stopper_in_the_lid_of_a_paper_coffee_cup_with_a_cardboard_sleeve.jpeg/170px-Hot_Stopper_in_the_lid_of_a_paper_coffee_cup_with_a_cardboard_sleeve.jpeg
2018-11-29 22:03:46	+aewens	Hmm, that link is long, one moment
2018-11-29 22:03:59	sebboh	ok.  But seriously if you google for 'hotstopper' every hit on the front page that isn't for some bulk-buy product is H.I.  In hindsight, the bulk product was probably the actual hotstoppers.
2018-11-29 22:04:10	kirch	are hot-stoppers the lil' coffee lid plugs?
2018-11-29 22:04:26	kirch	oh, I got distracteeeed and you aldready said so
2018-11-29 22:05:00	sebboh	Your long link is no match for my mighty work PC with full screen terminal and tiny bitmap font.

2018-11-29 22:05:44	brendantcc_lounge	lmao sebboh
2018-11-29 22:06:03	+aewens	sebboh: The reason is that H.I. are the people who coined the phrase "hotstopper".
2018-11-29 22:06:38	sebboh	17:01:28            sebboh | I conclude a hotstopper isn't a thing outside of that podcast world. 
2018-11-29 22:06:47	sebboh	oddly prescient.
2018-11-29 22:07:01	+aewens	They coin a lot of phrases in the podcast. Such as the word "freebooting" that describes the act of taking someone's work and then uploading it elsewhere to collect money on it outside the creator.
2018-11-29 22:07:29	+aewens	sebboh: They exist outside the podcast, but the word came from it ;)

2018-11-29 22:19:30	amcclure	powerbook screen's been broke so it's not like I could use it for anything else really
2018-11-29 22:20:18	brendantcc_lounge	well you'd need to be able to manage the server...
2018-11-29 22:20:31	brendantcc_lounge	you'd think it'd be easier to do it locally rather than over ssh
2018-11-29 22:20:37	amcclure	I have an external display that'll work for it though
2018-11-29 22:20:50	brendantcc_lounge	ah

2018-11-29 22:21:21	amcclure	which os would I use
2018-11-29 22:21:53	brendantcc_lounge	well obviously something it could handle
2018-11-29 22:21:57	sebboh	I would post 'hey this is x86' on the sign up page in case people care.

2018-11-30 10:41:28	login	Were you able to update it?
2018-11-30 10:42:53	login	There was also a file that had to be edited (to change the order of something) because if I didn't, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS would get stuck at initramfs for some reason having to do with not mounting in the right order or something like that)
2018-11-30 10:45:24	login	Things affecting the linux kernel and initd will not update normally, and will have to be updated by updating the squashfs'd OS

2018-11-30 16:46:37	+aewens	Anyways, for most of my storage stuff I've taken to using SD cards. They remind me of Nintendo DS cartridges, which fills me with joy.
2018-11-30 16:47:04	+aewens	So I'm fine to see CDs come to pass, they always stressed me out anyways because of how scratched up they could get.
2018-11-30 16:47:39	cdmnky	if only low-capacity read only sd cards were a standard for music albums or something like that
2018-11-30 16:47:50	cdmnky	microSD for singles
2018-11-30 16:49:09	cdmnky	make a music player that can play off of them, or copy to onboard storage or something
2018-11-30 16:49:16	cdmnky	that'd be cool
2018-11-30 16:49:31	ubergeek	yeah, CDs are far more fragile, and less storage than a CD...
2018-11-30 16:49:44	+aewens	In the world of streaming content, it's not really worth the effort to make a new standard on the hardware side for a new format.
2018-11-30 16:49:48	ubergeek	You can fit something like 15 CDs on a single $9, reusable USB disk
2018-11-30 16:49:55	mushmouth	hm you mean dvds oin the last part right?
2018-11-30 16:49:56	ubergeek	And, it's faster to boot
2018-11-30 16:50:00	mushmouth	ubergeek: 
2018-11-30 16:50:25	ubergeek	And, for laptops, it saves power not having it
2018-11-30 16:50:53	+aewens	My qualm with USBs is how they insist on being long to where I can accidentally snap them while they are plugged in. Sure, you can get a nubby one, but in high capacities the heat usually bogs down the speeds / destroys them.
2018-11-30 16:51:04	mushmouth	i find usbs are worse to deal with then dvds or cds
2018-11-30 16:51:58	+aewens	Which is why I love SD cards. They are small, can hold large amounts of data, work for almost all my devices, and remind me of my childhood gaming days.
2018-11-30 16:52:43	ubergeek	aewens: do you print out little cart labels for them?
2018-11-30 16:53:42	+aewens	I just tend to use tape and a marker. I have a carrying case for them, so when I fill it up I'll just have a legend on it for what each symbol I'll draw on them corresponds to.
2018-11-30 16:54:19	mushmouth	i actually recently bought a portable carry case for my dvds
2018-11-30 16:54:26	ubergeek	Someone found the Avery size label that is perfect for them, and was making game cart labels for them at one point

2018-11-30 16:56:12	+aewens	I hoard many much datas. Most of my SD cards hold backed up photos, previous projects, iso files, etc.

2018-11-30 17:23:34	+aewens	Just ask for the output of dmesg, /var/log/messages, and `ipmitool sel elist` and Google around. You can solve about 70% of issues from that.
2018-11-30 17:24:23	cdmnky	ouch, I'd go nuts if I had to read logs all day
2018-11-30 17:25:54	+aewens	The alternative is trusting a scientist to read the logs themselves and determine the issue themselves. I've found they tend to be very bad at not missing crucial messages in those logs.
2018-11-30 17:26:21	+aewens	Really, you just need to ctrl+f for "bad" "error" "fail" to find most things.

2018-11-30 17:39:30	+aewens	Yeah, and it's carrier agnostic and allows for SD expansion
2018-11-30 17:39:32	cdmnky	I was thinking the carrier finances it for $12/mo
2018-11-30 17:40:44	cdmnky	the website says it could be $9/mo

2018-11-30 18:31:15	kirch	if you have one screw, a well-stocked hardware store usually has things to help measure it to see what you need to replace it with

2018-11-30 18:34:16	+jan6	just buy one of each, you can never have too many loose screws /s
2018-11-30 18:34:53	ubergeek	yeah, hardware stores usually have the tool to do the measuring...

2018-11-30 18:36:45	cdmnky	found the replacement keyboard part number for the broken ctrl key, I searched on lenovo's site and "this part number is not orderable" lol
2018-11-30 18:37:18	+aewens	cdmnky: Almost no manufacturers sell individual keys, you usually just replace the full keyboard.
2018-11-30 18:37:25	+jan6	ebay
2018-11-30 18:37:29	+jan6	or china
2018-11-30 18:37:32	cdmnky	yeah
2018-11-30 18:37:44	cdmnky	that was the number for the keyboard
2018-11-30 18:37:59	cdmnky	although, there's tons of EN keyboards
2018-11-30 18:38:07	+jan6	I mean, it's not worth the trouble for them to sell thousands of tiny little parts almost nobody buys anyway
2018-11-30 18:38:26	+aewens	That and replacing a keyboard is far easier than replacing a single key.
2018-11-30 18:38:33	+jan6	specific keyboard models kinda that too
2018-11-30 18:39:02	cdmnky	that's why, I have to buy the stupid palmrest with it too
2018-11-30 18:39:06	+aewens	You can usually grab the keyboard from Amazon for about $15-$30 for most laptops.
2018-11-30 18:39:12	cdmnky	and it's $190
2018-11-30 18:39:24	+aewens	You broke the palmrest too? oof
2018-11-30 18:39:33	cdmnky	no, they won't sell just the keyboard lol
2018-11-30 18:39:55	+aewens	What laptop is this?
2018-11-30 18:39:56	cdmnky	I was going to 3d print the broken switch since I still have the keycap and the membrane itself still works

2018-11-30 19:04:55	cdmnky	it would be easier to just reverse-engineer the switch itself and 3D print it to save $30 and the effort of taking it apart lol
2018-11-30 19:05:23	cdmnky	although it's nice to know that it uses standard SODIMM slots, and I have an extra HDD/CD drive slot

2018-11-30 19:27:13	SinaCutie	Hi severak
2018-11-30 19:27:38	cdmnky	ben cirno is a touhou character
2018-11-30 19:27:42	SinaCutie	^
2018-11-30 19:27:49	~ben	is that an anime or something
2018-11-30 19:28:01	~ben	i'm assuming so
2018-11-30 19:28:03	cdmnky	an OLD series of japanese PC/98 games
2018-11-30 19:28:13	~ben	oh huh

2018-11-30 19:29:16	cdmnky	I still can't beat the first one lol
2018-11-30 19:29:22	~ben	anime isn't really my thing
2018-11-30 19:29:46	cdmnky	still, a pretty neat piece of retro pc gaming history
2018-11-30 19:30:38	~ben	fair enough :P
2018-11-30 19:31:09	cdmnky	i didn't even know how they did CJK characters in the '90s until I learned about touhou and PC98

2018-11-30 20:53:27	cdmnky	that's funny, sdf gopher command being dumb again. it cut off the top of my phlog today because I had links at the bottom and it wouldn't let me scroll up above the topmost link lol

2018-11-30 20:55:13	cdmnky	tomasino just seeing if it works right. I like to test it out on multiple clients to see if anything's broken at all

2018-11-30 20:55:58	~tomasino	it's a good plan
2018-11-30 20:57:05	cdmnky	I wrote a little shell script with sed that let me write it out normally, and then put in all the little gopher quirks into it afterwards so I don't have to deal with the ugly formatting lol
2018-11-30 20:58:15	~tomasino	that's pretty much what 'burrow gophermap xxxx' does
2018-11-30 20:58:32	~tomasino	except it strips out that formatting from existing entries into a tempfile, and when you save and quit, reapplies them back to the original
2018-11-30 20:59:07	~tomasino	when i phlog, i don't add any of that crap in either. burrow fixes me up after i save & quit

2018-11-30 21:26:24	cdmnky	jan6 nah, I just did a recursive download of the music directory only allowing audio files to download
2018-11-30 21:26:40	cdmnky	lets hope it isn't more than a few dozen gigs
2018-11-30 21:27:13	 *	cdmnky secretly hopes it's under 28 GB so he'll be able to copy everything at once onto a flash drive

2018-11-30 21:28:59	cdmnky	well, I have no music library, so I have to start somewhere
2018-11-30 21:30:08	+aewens	I get my music listening to Pandora and putting the ones I like into a YouTube playlist. Always go for the lyrics videos since they won't have ads.
2018-11-30 21:30:34	+jan6	sometimes do
2018-11-30 21:30:46	+jan6	but c'mon, don't you have adblock on all your devics?

2018-11-30 21:31:37	cdmnky	does anyone else alias youtube-dl to yt because it's such an annoying command to type?
2018-11-30 21:32:31	cdmnky	another tip, youtube-dl -F lists output formats of the video and you can use youtube-dl -f(number of format) to save data loss from conversion
2018-11-30 21:33:12	+mspe	alias yt='youtube-dl -f best'
2018-11-30 21:33:14	+mspe	^^

2018-11-30 21:38:26	+jan6	I sure can, lol

2018-11-30 22:10:50	+aewens	For some OS's, when you are root it asks if you are sure before deleting any files (e.g. CentOS)
2018-11-30 22:11:11	~ben	huh never seen that
2018-11-30 22:11:22	~ben	i don't really every use centos tho
2018-11-30 22:11:48	+aewens	Fairly handy for production stuff, don't want to accidentally delete something important without any warnings.
2018-11-30 22:12:38	+aewens	So if I do `rm q` it asks: "rm: remove regular file ‘q’?"
2018-11-30 22:12:56	~ben	so rm -i by default
2018-11-30 22:13:24	+aewens	Basically
2018-11-30 22:13:41	~ben	i'd be that it's just alias rm="rm -i"
2018-11-30 22:13:54	~ben	unless it's a different rm
2018-11-30 22:14:06	~ben	or -I
2018-11-30 22:14:11	+aewens	Sure, but that's the default in some OS's, so the yes| to be sure I destroy everything regardless of the distro.

2018-11-30 22:14:58	~ben	-i and -I
2018-11-30 22:15:03	+jan6	check your .bashrc, there are a few commented out lines for that
2018-11-30 22:15:14	+mspe	your “yes|sudo rm -rf /boot && reboot” wouldn't ave any consequence on my system :P
2018-11-30 22:15:15	+jan6	something like "rm -i" iirc
2018-11-30 22:15:26	+jan6	too late
2018-11-30 22:15:34	~ben	same becuase --preserve-root is the default
2018-11-30 22:15:42	+aewens	The defaults in CentOS's .bashrc for root:

2018-12-01 00:06:54	fosslinux	i dont use mumble so i wouldnt know :P
2018-12-01 00:07:02	nilaky	but i added cli commands so i can issue it commands without having to chase it around as it changes channels lol
2018-12-01 00:07:29	fosslinux	probably good idea
2018-12-01 00:07:43	nilaky	("if sys.stdin in select()" basic cli input added to the main "while self.isAlive" loop)
2018-12-01 00:08:02	nilaky	cuz it's got a bug where it doesn't notice the channel it joins until it swaps channels (???)
2018-12-01 00:08:06	fosslinux	i love code that has self.isAlive
2018-12-01 00:08:18	nilaky	so all its messages go into the void until you make it bounce channels
2018-12-01 00:08:40	nilaky	yeah lol it's like, graceful shutdown should be done by catching SIGTERM ...
2018-12-01 00:08:47	fosslinux	:P
2018-12-01 00:08:57	nilaky	but it opens the opportunity to "/msg bot goaway"

2018-12-01 00:50:16	~ben	feel free to set up a matrix/tilde.chat bridge
2018-12-01 00:50:17	l4p1n	i've got my own server so yeh. Database getting filled as usual
2018-12-01 00:50:20	~ben	if you're interested ;)
2018-12-01 00:50:33	~ben	yeah i think that's why disroot stopped matrix
2018-12-01 00:50:55	~ben	and just generally terrible performance with the matrix.org bridge
2018-12-01 00:51:04	l4p1n	got ~80 GB of space left on the SSD for database and about ~1 TB on a partition on the server hard drive

2018-12-01 00:52:13	~ben	will probably move ~team there
2018-12-01 00:52:22	l4p1n	lemme check to see if I can bridge the gap

2018-12-01 00:53:23	login	how do they do with their prices?
2018-12-01 00:53:32	~ben	hm?
2018-12-01 00:53:41	login	y so cheap?
2018-12-01 00:53:58	~ben	"The server auction not only markets standardized server systems such as those found in our product portfolio but also customized systems that were adapted to customer requirements in the past. "
2018-12-01 00:54:14	login	aws is anyway for using to the fullest and paying for all their auxiliary services (aws x)
2018-12-01 00:54:54	l4p1n	can't select a custom network from the builtin bridge --"
2018-12-01 00:55:18	~ben	there was a matrix-appservice type thing

2018-12-01 00:58:03	login	why does netflix use aws for non-media?
2018-12-01 00:58:53	~ben	cause they're not going for bang/buck
2018-12-01 00:59:07	~ben	probably a platform effect
2018-12-01 00:59:49	login	they use a lot of aws stuff and make it all work together
2018-12-01 01:00:10	~ben	they can afford it i guess
2018-12-01 01:00:19	login	they know they'll make their own replacements for aws eventually... when the need arises...
2018-12-01 01:00:37	~ben	possibly
2018-12-01 01:00:50	~ben	but i thought they decommissioned most of their datacenters
2018-12-01 01:01:01	login	they use it for everything other than storing/transcoding the actual videos..
2018-12-01 01:01:15	~ben	and the point is?
2018-12-01 01:01:27	~ben	i'm just saying that it's way overpriced for the stuff we're doing
2018-12-01 01:01:38	login	yeah... it is
2018-12-01 01:01:54	ubergeek	Because netflix radpily ramps up, and ramps down machines, so it wouldn't be cost effective for them to own their own machines
2018-12-01 01:02:02	~ben	i remember vil saying he had an aws bill of $120/month ish
2018-12-01 01:02:09	~ben	how about no
2018-12-01 01:02:19	login	i would love for tilde.town to run  on geothermal energy in iceland...
2018-12-01 01:02:31	login	it's more stable than coal lol
2018-12-01 01:02:34	ubergeek	And, aws basically upgrades GPUs for transcoding media for free
2018-12-01 01:02:35	fosslinux	jeez
2018-12-01 01:02:39	fosslinux	thats expensive
2018-12-01 01:02:45	~ben	for a 2gb machine
2018-12-01 01:02:54	~ben	no wait
2018-12-01 01:02:57	~ben	2 core 4gb
2018-12-01 01:03:07	login	how much space?
2018-12-01 01:03:11	~ben	100gb iirc
2018-12-01 01:03:17	ubergeek	Yeah, vil could likely slash his bill by 75% if he moved to a dedi or even digital ocean (Still overpriced, but not as bad as AWS)
2018-12-01 01:03:23	~ben	which is less than $10 on hetzner
2018-12-01 01:03:24	login	basically medium ec2
2018-12-01 01:03:28	l4p1n	gonna setup that thing later because getting late rn
2018-12-01 01:03:33	~ben	DO is still overpriced

2018-12-01 01:11:26	~ben	wot
2018-12-01 01:11:28	~ben	why
2018-12-01 01:11:30	login	Meaning, 1x input gives 1x output... my current strategy to 'stream' real time is to let it transcode at more than 1x input (as fast as it goes), and then have a simultanous parallel process that streams the output at 1x
2018-12-01 01:11:51	login	If i take input at 1x, output is always less than 1x because the gpu can't work like that...
2018-12-01 01:12:07	~ben	my desktop has a gtx1080ti
2018-12-01 01:12:11	~ben	that could probably do it
2018-12-01 01:12:13	login	And I can't set input to more than 1x so that output is 1x (that seems like a control system design problem)
2018-12-01 01:12:18	login	ben: yeah, that would probably do it

2018-12-01 01:42:31	~deepend	whos tilde.tel?
2018-12-01 01:43:02	mushmouth	also ended up buying spyro

2018-12-01 01:46:32	login	So it checks the first DNS system, and for domains it can't find in it, goes through the second one
2018-12-01 01:46:42	mushmouth	iw isht ehre was something like that too
2018-12-01 01:46:45	mushmouth	ahhh
2018-12-01 01:46:47	login	Current DNS only checks the first one, and if it can't find it, determines that that address doesn't exist...
2018-12-01 01:46:50	mushmouth	i was there was something like that too
2018-12-01 01:46:53	mushmouth	???
2018-12-01 01:46:55	mushmouth	i wish
2018-12-01 01:47:11	login	So when i looked into alt dns, i found alt-dns servers with new domain names...

2018-12-01 01:48:11	~ben	it returns the first one that has a dns answer
2018-12-01 01:48:14	ubergeek	tilde tel: https://proxy.yourtilde.com/baud.baby/phlog/fs20181128.txt
2018-12-01 01:48:45	ubergeek	login: what do you mean union of two roots?
2018-12-01 01:48:46	mushmouth	i wish there was a search engine that had gopher support
2018-12-01 01:48:56	ubergeek	mushmouth:  veronica-2
2018-12-01 01:49:07	mushmouth	but i also want a gopher client that not bad
2018-12-01 01:49:14	ubergeek	lynx?
2018-12-01 01:49:14	mushmouth	my friend making one for jvm
2018-12-01 01:49:19	mushmouth	eh
2018-12-01 01:49:30	mushmouth	lynx works but it doesn't fullfill my needs
2018-12-01 01:49:42	ubergeek	login: for example, .tilde is a lone effort of tilde users/operators right now
2018-12-01 01:49:43	mushmouth	i don't know what those needs are yet
2018-12-01 01:50:11	ubergeek	If you use two of the .tilde DNS servers as your resolvers, it works for .tilde TLD, all TLDs honored by OpenNIC, and ICANN domains
2018-12-01 01:50:14	mushmouth	i would like proper text being rednered. i don't remember if lynx gopher does that
2018-12-01 01:50:36	ubergeek	All lynx does is render text, so I do not believe I understand what you're asking for?
2018-12-01 01:50:53	mushmouth	like. it wraps text if your screen is too large
2018-12-01 01:51:05	ubergeek	oh...  Ok, I get you.
2018-12-01 01:51:24	mushmouth	i don't recall lynx doing that
2018-12-01 01:51:39	ubergeek	I don't think lynx does, but I believe it's because it breaks the philosophy of gopher:  Just deliver the file, and leave it to the document creator to generate the format
2018-12-01 01:51:51	mushmouth	ah
2018-12-01 01:52:00	mushmouth	i don't seem to have that philosophy with gopher
2018-12-01 01:52:04	ubergeek	Main reason a good idea when doing gopher docs is to break at 75 cols.  65 is another common "rule"
2018-12-01 01:52:33	ubergeek	ie, all of my gopher docs break at col 75
2018-12-01 01:52:49	mushmouth	i seem to try and break at 75col
2018-12-01 01:53:02	mushmouth	but i don't remember since i don't have lines enabled
2018-12-01 01:53:03	ubergeek	personally, if you don't have an 80 col display, you should expect issues :)  (Sorry C64 users)
2018-12-01 01:53:17	mushmouth	hey! c64 got me into retro computing
2018-12-01 01:53:20	mushmouth	:P
2018-12-01 01:54:06	ubergeek	I get ya.  I have a C64 now I plan on getting on the interwebs (Once I get a PS for it)
2018-12-01 01:54:13	ubergeek	But, it's a pain I'm willing to self-inflict :)
2018-12-01 01:54:25	ubergeek	Now, ask me how bad things look on my Tandy Model 100?
2018-12-01 01:54:35	mushmouth	i love tandy's too
2018-12-01 01:54:36	ubergeek	40x4 display :)
2018-12-01 01:54:41	mushmouth	really any retro computer is cool to me
2018-12-01 01:54:51	ubergeek	sorry, 40x6
2018-12-01 01:55:11	mushmouth	i mean i bought the 386 dos 6.2/win 3.11
2018-12-01 01:55:15	mushmouth	from deepend 
2018-12-01 01:56:08	mushmouth	and it has a vga/mono display at low res
2018-12-01 01:57:52	mushmouth	my monitor for it
2018-12-01 01:58:20	ubergeek	I thought even EGA supported 80x23?
2018-12-01 01:58:39	ubergeek	tomasino: some fodder for your CYOA show - https://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Books
2018-12-01 01:58:52	mushmouth	ubergeek: also i think jan6 wants me to go insane
2018-12-01 01:59:03	ubergeek	lol
2018-12-01 01:59:06	mushmouth	setup a wireless or wired for my retro systems and people can play from at home
2018-12-01 01:59:24	ubergeek	The Wifi32 modem is great for getting retro systems online
2018-12-01 01:59:36	ubergeek	Anything with a serial port can use it
2018-12-01 01:59:51	mushmouth	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellivision
2018-12-01 01:59:55	mushmouth	this is one other system i want to get
2018-12-01 01:59:59	ubergeek	I need to get around to building one, since i have a bunch of esp8266's lying around
2018-12-01 02:00:04	mushmouth	i played some good rip offs from it
2018-12-01 02:00:08	ubergeek	The intellivision was overrated, imo
2018-12-01 02:00:18	ubergeek	I had one, and it was my least-used system as a kid
2018-12-01 02:00:34	mushmouth	i had a lot of fun from knock off games from it
2018-12-01 02:00:53	mushmouth	snake was funny to me
2018-12-01 02:01:16	ubergeek	true.  the knockoffs were pretty good.
2018-12-01 02:01:21	slipyx	snake?!
2018-12-01 02:01:25	ubergeek	The original games they had, no so much, unshockingly

2018-12-01 02:04:24	slipyx	you gonna record the unboxings
2018-12-01 02:04:48	slipyx	we need a modern n64 kid
2018-12-01 02:05:06	ubergeek	If you get a mini or classic, record the unboxing, and upload it to youtube with the other 50,000 unboxing vids for those :P
2018-12-01 02:05:20	ubergeek	slipyx: I agree.  N64 was probably the last of the great consoles
2018-12-01 02:05:29	mushmouth	nah
2018-12-01 02:05:35	mushmouth	im not going to do unboxing vids

2018-12-01 02:16:33	ubergeek	I mean, it was really underwhelming to go to MS-DOS from OS-9

2018-12-01 02:18:03	~ben	a what?

2018-12-01 03:52:49	mushmouth	i knew somebody who worked with coreos it wasn't fun trying to reason with them
2018-12-01 03:53:03	mushmouth	in plan9 of all places
2018-12-01 03:54:17	~ben	it sucks but i'd say that comparing it to hitler is a little bit too far
2018-12-01 03:54:27	mushmouth	eh
2018-12-01 03:54:30	~ben	the worst thing is the people tended to use it for the wrong purposes
2018-12-01 03:54:46	mushmouth	i just have a hard time even grapsing the concept of it
2018-12-01 03:54:53	mushmouth	that just my mindset on it
2018-12-01 03:55:03	slipyx	godwin would be proud
2018-12-01 03:55:04	mushmouth	i saw Sony? talk on it
2018-12-01 03:55:13	mushmouth	it didn't make much sense
2018-12-01 03:55:15	~ben	i still don't really get k8s
2018-12-01 03:55:42	mushmouth	they said because it was like docker it's easier to setup for teams and such
2018-12-01 03:55:56	~ben	k8s or coreos?
2018-12-01 03:55:57	mushmouth	config are "Easier"
2018-12-01 03:55:58	mushmouth	coreos
2018-12-01 03:56:21	~ben	aiui coreos was meant to be a place to just run docker
2018-12-01 03:56:40	mushmouth	but because docker on every modern system now
2018-12-01 03:56:42	mushmouth	i don't see the point
2018-12-01 03:56:55	~ben	especially now that places are using k8s
2018-12-01 03:57:31	mushmouth	and i don't like docker much. but that because i barely had to touch a container
2018-12-01 03:57:44	mushmouth	so lxc and docker don't make much sense to me right now
2018-12-01 03:58:04	~ben	lxc is basically just VMs
2018-12-01 03:58:09	~ben	docker is "containers"
2018-12-01 03:58:17	~ben	aka a kernel cgroup abstraction
2018-12-01 03:58:31	mushmouth	lxc makes a little more sense
2018-12-01 03:58:49	mushmouth	docker couldn't wrap my head around it yet
2018-12-01 03:58:56	mushmouth	or figure out a purpose for it
2018-12-01 04:00:49	~ben	docker makes it super easy for people to run apps
2018-12-01 04:00:58	~ben	when they don't know how to do stuff without it
2018-12-01 04:01:04	~ben	plus it bundles all the deps for you
2018-12-01 04:01:15	~ben	but for me at least it's a bigger pain to debug
2018-12-01 04:01:24	mushmouth	isn't just a repository of apps or what ever for it to work? on a stable release?
2018-12-01 04:01:33	~ben	hm?
2018-12-01 04:01:40	~ben	nah not necessarily
2018-12-01 04:02:04	~tomasino	in the hotel!
2018-12-01 04:02:07	~ben	w00t!
2018-12-01 04:02:11	~ben	nice
2018-12-01 04:02:28	mushmouth	i never fully understood docker or had experience with it to be fair
2018-12-01 04:02:40	mushmouth	lxc made more sense because it was explained to me as a vm
2018-12-01 04:02:50	~ben	it's an interesting piece of software
2018-12-01 04:03:02	~ben	but i think it's the bundled deps that's the huge seller for people
2018-12-01 04:03:33	mushmouth	and i hear there pros and cons to both anyways
2018-12-01 04:03:36	mushmouth	so it kind of confusing
2018-12-01 04:03:50	~ben	there are certainly use cases for it

2018-12-01 04:30:39	~tomasino	gang!
2018-12-01 04:30:58	ahriman	do you run the gaps patch or vanilla
2018-12-01 04:40:10	~tomasino	vanilla
2018-12-01 04:47:04	ahriman	i ran vanilla for years, but a few weeks ago went with gaps. a little space between windows is nice aesthetically
2018-12-01 04:48:55	npa	i3 gang represent
2018-12-01 04:50:45	ahriman	what are out colors
2018-12-01 04:50:48	ahriman	our
2018-12-01 04:52:48	npa	you know the default i3bar white/green/red?
2018-12-01 04:53:04	npa	and some yellow for good measure too
2018-12-01 04:57:55	ahriman	sounds good
2018-12-01 05:17:20	stompy	i hate i3 lol
2018-12-01 05:17:22	stompy	but i love awesome
2018-12-01 05:17:58	stompy	one of my fav setups was with awesomewm and i3bar on top
2018-12-01 05:27:54	ahriman	awesomewm + i3bar would be pretty nice
2018-12-01 05:28:04	ahriman	awesomewm was my first tiling wm
2018-12-01 05:29:30	npa	^ ditto
2018-12-01 05:29:51	npa	i liked awesome, but the plugin i wrote had a memory leak lmao
2018-12-01 05:30:26	npa	couldn't be bothered to fix, and then i started using multiple monitors more, so i3 made sense to me
2018-12-01 05:31:24	fosslinux	npa: what did you write the plugin in (wat language)
2018-12-01 05:32:05	npa	lua I think it was
2018-12-01 05:32:38	fosslinux	a bit hard to have a memory leak in lua afaik :lmao:
2018-12-01 05:33:29	npa	leak might not be the right word
2018-12-01 05:33:30	~khuxkm	lua is a bit hard to make memory leaks in unless you write actual bytecode
2018-12-01 05:33:41	npa	acculumation of global variables or something or other
2018-12-01 05:33:42	~khuxkm	then ou can destroy the VM ;)
2018-12-01 05:33:45	~khuxkm	s/ou/you/
2018-12-01 05:33:45	sedbot	<khuxkm> then you can destroy the VM ;)
2018-12-01 05:33:49	~khuxkm	eww global vars
2018-12-01 05:33:58	npa	:>
2018-12-01 05:36:03	npa	it was to do with this: https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/1490
2018-12-01 05:36:24	npa	does lack of GCing count as memory leak..? idk
2018-12-01 05:39:21	SinaCutie	Hello

2018-12-01 19:20:38	~ben	lol
2018-12-01 19:21:26	cdmnky	then again, my spanish teacher DID cut class half the time, and was drunk a couple times during school
2018-12-01 19:21:40	~ben	what a baller
2018-12-01 19:21:55	cdmnky	I can't believe she wasn't fired, other than the fact that the she's one of two fluent spanish speakers I know of in the area
2018-12-01 19:22:05	~ben	wasn't fired?
2018-12-01 19:22:07	~ben	tenure
2018-12-01 19:22:09	~ben	lol
2018-12-01 19:22:12	cdmnky	the other one learned spanish because they cut her french class lol
2018-12-01 19:22:29	~ben	oh damn
2018-12-01 19:22:42	~ben	our german teacher had to switch to french when german was cut
2018-12-01 19:22:52	cdmnky	it
2018-12-01 19:22:53	~ben	he was actually from germany 
2018-12-01 19:23:03	~ben	and his french was just fine lol
2018-12-01 19:23:09	~ben	i took spanish anyways
2018-12-01 19:23:19	cdmnky	it's kinda sad that the school cut french out of non-interest, seeing as how quebec is so close by
2018-12-01 19:23:31	~ben	oh right that's super silly
2018-12-01 19:23:47	cdmnky	my spanish teacher was from Panama, so we got the "generic" version from what I hear
2018-12-01 19:24:15	~ben	panamá you mean
2018-12-01 19:24:24	~ben	;)
2018-12-01 19:24:28	cdmnky	although, NY french classes are France french, and Quebecois french is sometimes unintelligable to people who learned france french
2018-12-01 19:25:01	~ben	oh yeah i've heard that
2018-12-01 19:25:27	cdmnky	I have a coin from Panamá, it's labeled "Vn Cvarto de Balboa"
2018-12-01 19:25:32	cdmnky	all fancy latin like
2018-12-01 19:25:54	cdmnky	I think they use the USD nowadays though
2018-12-01 19:25:58	~ben	was it that there was no u in latin?
2018-12-01 19:26:03	~ben	ecuador uses usd
2018-12-01 19:26:36	cdmnky	older latin uses V instead of U, I know that much. I believe V WAS U and that's why W is called double-u
2018-12-01 19:26:58	~ben	oah right
2018-12-01 19:27:10	cdmnky	something about the beginning of the hellenistic era and the greeks bringing the v sound and stuff

2018-12-01 19:27:43	cdmnky	I should take a Roman history class, although I think my college cut all their european history classes for african and native american studies
2018-12-01 19:28:42	cdmnky	kinda sucks, I wanted to take a japanese class but the only asian language they had was mandarin chinese. although my foreign language credit was already satisfied from HS
2018-12-01 19:30:39	+jan6	"W is called double-u" over here it's the double-v, lol
2018-12-01 19:32:46	~ben	in german it's just called "vay"
2018-12-01 19:32:57	~ben	and v is called "fau"
2018-12-01 19:33:10	~ben	no double
2018-12-01 19:33:50	cdmnky	sounds kinda like Frau
2018-12-01 19:34:03	~ben	V-Frau
2018-12-01 19:34:09	cdmnky	I only know Frau and Herr from that one Wolfenstein cutscene where hitler auditions actors

2018-12-01 19:35:37	~ben	oh no i was confused by jan6's comment
2018-12-01 19:35:45	~ben	i figured
2018-12-01 19:36:18	mushmouth	after seeing jan6 json anyone would be confused by jan6 :P
2018-12-01 19:37:00	cdmnky	at least there isn't any bad keming to make things worse to read

2018-12-01 19:41:51	cdmnky	what's even worse is when you don't properly escape your bash prompt colors and the line wraps really horribly
2018-12-01 19:41:54	login	So it's full sed
2018-12-01 19:41:56	login	I understand now
2018-12-01 19:42:15	login	cdmnky: yeah, i noticed that when i tried to change the color scheme....
2018-12-01 19:42:33	login	All sorts of \[ and \] were required to make it not count color codes in "number of characters"
2018-12-01 19:42:38	~ben	yeah i think it's most of sed

2018-12-01 19:43:45	cdmnky	not only that, but you need it for function calls too (like I did for the git status thing)

2018-12-01 19:46:43	~ben	this one's real goofy
2018-12-01 19:46:43	cdmnky	yeah, I haven't done the whole if it's ahead or behind thing

2018-12-01 19:48:02	~ben	it's kinda handy
2018-12-01 19:48:07	~ben	i like the is_git_dirty one
2018-12-01 19:48:30	cdmnky	although my prompt is pretty slow now lol
2018-12-01 19:48:54	cdmnky	it takes a solid 15 seconds after login on boot for it to show up
2018-12-01 19:48:59	cdmnky	I need to fix that lol
2018-12-01 19:49:53	cdmnky	I'm no webdev, but this looks like a huge bug https://mastodon.social/users/manchot/statuses/101167091253443520
2018-12-01 19:50:14	cdmnky	also, why did they make their infographic after the windows 10 error screen?
2018-12-01 19:50:41	~ben	15 seconds!?
2018-12-01 19:50:43	~ben	wot
2018-12-01 19:53:39	+jan6	lol
2018-12-01 19:55:07	~ben	that's an absurdly long time for a shell startup
2018-12-01 19:55:37	cdmnky	i think it's because it checks git stuff everywhere instead of just git repos
2018-12-01 19:56:16	cdmnky	otherwise it's fine once it's loaded into memory
2018-12-01 19:56:23	~ben	git stuff everywhere?
2018-12-01 19:57:54	~ben	i don't see anything in your .bashrc would take that long
2018-12-01 19:59:05	cdmnky	maybe it's just reading the file from disk on an hdd
2018-12-01 20:00:16	~ben	that still wouldn't take that long
2018-12-01 20:00:21	~ben	there's gotta be something else going on
2018-12-01 20:03:14	mushmouth	as much as i don't like git. i don't think it's git
2018-12-01 20:03:49	~ben	git's fine

2018-12-01 20:10:42	 *	cdmnky is currently trying to adapt ben's is_git function to bash

2018-12-01 20:12:06	~ben	i want to put more stuff on sr.ht
2018-12-01 20:12:45	 *	cdmnky kinda hats bash if syntax and can't really understand it that well
2018-12-01 20:13:25	cdmnky	right now i'm getting "syntax error near unexpected token fi"
2018-12-01 20:13:30	cdmnky	not very helpful lol
2018-12-01 20:13:54	~ben	fi?
2018-12-01 20:14:07	~ben	oh so you're past is_git
2018-12-01 20:14:24	~ben	bash syntax can be Weird
2018-12-01 20:14:43	cdmnky	i think i'm not getting the conditional statement quite right
2018-12-01 20:15:08	cdmnky	i think it'd be if [ is_git ] then
2018-12-01 20:15:38	~ben	wouldn't it just be if is_git; then
2018-12-01 20:15:55	~ben	cause you're checking the return code and don't need to call test
2018-12-01 20:16:40	 *	cdmnky 's mind is blown that the brackets are actual calls
2018-12-01 20:16:40	~ben	you need a semicolon or newline before "then"
2018-12-01 20:16:45	~ben	/usr/bin/[
2018-12-01 20:17:00	~ben	it's a literal executable
2018-12-01 20:17:11	cdmnky	huh
2018-12-01 20:17:13	~ben	and in this case you shouldn't need it
2018-12-01 20:17:29	cdmnky	it works, and I think it works a tiny bit faster
2018-12-01 20:17:53	~ben	it's not a porcelain command so it should be pretty fast
2018-12-01 20:18:15	cdmnky	oh yeah, it's MUCH faster when running first after a tty login
2018-12-01 20:18:32	~ben	you might like this little bash funciton
2018-12-01 20:19:03	~ben	g() { (( $# == 0 )) && git status || git "$@" }
2018-12-01 20:19:11	~ben	i think that should b right

2018-12-01 20:35:44	login	By favourite thing about Git is that it's not "file based", but "snapshot based"

2018-12-01 20:48:16	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-01 20:48:33	fosslinux	i really have two identities fosslinux and some other one

2018-12-01 20:48:48	fosslinux	the fosslinux is my tech world one, the some other one is my more personal one
2018-12-01 20:49:30	+jan6	is it "some other one" because you prefer privacy or because you can't remember it cause you're always in the tech world? ;P
2018-12-01 20:49:50	fosslinux	because THEN IT WOULDNT BE TWO SEPERATE IDENTITES
2018-12-01 20:49:51	cdmnky	reminds me of the new background check law in ny, the state is trying to force people to hand over all social media logins (yes, passwords too) and the search histories for the previous three years
2018-12-01 20:49:57	fosslinux	because I WOULD JUST HAVE LINKED THEM
2018-12-01 20:50:07	~ben	woah chill with the caps

2018-12-01 20:51:04	cdmnky	they frame it as for gun control, but all state employees go through the same background checks when applying (especially state police)
2018-12-01 20:51:19	fosslinux	where is privacy these days,.......
2018-12-01 20:51:25	~ben	nowhere to be found

2018-12-01 20:51:55	cdmnky	it seems like if you say something mildly controversial, your career is ruined if it's found out by someone
2018-12-01 20:52:08	mushmouth	cdmnky: that true to anything
2018-12-01 20:52:11	cdmnky	unless you build your career off of being controversial
2018-12-01 20:52:13	+jan6	also you can use the sieve filters to manually filter stuff too, if the spam filter doesn't
2018-12-01 20:52:18	~ben	yup
2018-12-01 20:52:31	~ben	webmail has a sieve settings page
2018-12-01 20:52:43	~ben	and you can connect any other sieve client that you like
2018-12-01 20:53:52	l4p1n	going to try to bridge the gap.  wish me luck because i feel like imma suffer a little bit with configuration

2018-12-01 20:55:53	login	Is https://keepassxc.org/blog/ a good choice for password manager?
2018-12-01 20:56:03	~ben	i use keepassxc
2018-12-01 20:56:05	login	or should i go with an scrypt-based stateless password manager?
2018-12-01 20:56:05	~ben	it's solid
2018-12-01 20:56:05	fosslinux	yeah keepassxc is fine
2018-12-01 20:56:11	~ben	keepass or pass

2018-12-01 20:57:32	l4p1n	mushmouth: while with most of the clients you use the protocol as an instant chat service, you can use it for other things and custom events that you send and process
2018-12-01 20:57:40	fosslinux	(and it costs money)
2018-12-01 20:57:42	+jan6	just use qubes OS and don't allow the pass manager to connect to net
2018-12-01 20:57:47	fosslinux	lmao
2018-12-01 20:57:50	cdmnky	I'm gonna rotate all my passwords this month anyway, so if you have any cross-platform (linux/windows/android) suggestions
2018-12-01 20:57:52	fosslinux	i did try qubes os
2018-12-01 20:57:57	~ben	cdmnky: keepass or pass
2018-12-01 20:57:59	fosslinux	it was DAMN SLOW
2018-12-01 20:58:21	+jan6	cdmnky: use a gpg encrypted .txt file
2018-12-01 20:58:25	~deepend	i dont use a password manager.. i memorize my passwords.. but if I did id like to have a self hosted srever that could be able to sync passwords even onto my mobile devices. 
2018-12-01 20:58:36	cdmnky	ben but if I need to log in on a public computer, would they work?
2018-12-01 20:58:39	fosslinux	deepend: how secure are your passwords
2018-12-01 20:58:49	fosslinux	and how many do you have that you can memorize them????
2018-12-01 20:58:52	fosslinux	i have nearly 1000
2018-12-01 20:58:54	~ben	jan6: that's what pass is
2018-12-01 20:58:54	fosslinux	sorry
2018-12-01 20:58:55	fosslinux	100
2018-12-01 20:58:58	~deepend	depends on what I put them on.. if its important they are secure enough
2018-12-01 20:59:07	~ben	deepend: try bitwarden; it's self-hostable
2018-12-01 20:59:10	fosslinux	right
2018-12-01 20:59:17	+jan6	my passwords are the worst, IF you know enough about me, which nobody does
2018-12-01 20:59:23	~ben	cdmnky: i wouldn't do that; just pull it up on your phone and type it in manyually
2018-12-01 20:59:24	fosslinux	a3wens recommended bitwarden
2018-12-01 20:59:37	~ben	bitwarden is open source i think
2018-12-01 20:59:39	fosslinux	jan6: you told us your login password :P
2018-12-01 20:59:50	+jan6	login doesn't know my password tho
2018-12-01 21:00:02	~deepend	yes if I didn;t memorize my passwords it'd be safer and the passwords would be better.. but I use keys, and two factor everywhere that I can.. so no overly worried about it
2018-12-01 21:00:05	fosslinux	bad puns
2018-12-01 21:00:13	+jan6	stop pinging login btw? he has unfortunate name, but still

2018-12-01 22:29:10	~ben	are you sending messages on there?
2018-12-01 22:29:58	l4p1n	yep
2018-12-01 22:30:37	l4p1n	but now I'm thinking...
2018-12-01 22:32:37	l4p1n	is the homeserver trying to join the appserver and errors out silently because NXDOMAIN ?
2018-12-01 22:33:32	~ben	what's the difference between home and app server?
2018-12-01 22:33:37	~ben	i'm not familiar with matrix at all
2018-12-01 22:34:36	l4p1n	homeserver is the Matrix server that federates all the stuff, manages rooms and users. Appservices (and not appservers, my bad) is something that can interact with the homeserver to add bridges for example
2018-12-01 22:34:55	l4p1n	I'm suspecting the homeserver can't join the appservice because of NXDOMAIN
2018-12-01 22:34:58	~ben	ah ok so it's what they're calling plugins/etc
2018-12-01 22:35:04	l4p1n	basically
2018-12-01 22:35:10	~ben	what domains is it getting NXDOMAIN for
2018-12-01 22:35:56	l4p1n	ehhh... something that I written somewhere irc.matrix.l4p1n.ch IIRC

2018-12-01 23:53:18	jakob	the only real reason I'm doing the math double major is because there's a lot of overlap with the CS major requirements

2018-12-02 01:03:58	M-l4p1n	I don't think you can on the Android app... unfortunately. Neither on the webapp if you don't mess up the CSS and stuff
2018-12-02 01:04:08	M-l4p1n	out of the box*
2018-12-02 01:04:31	~ben	fair enough 
2018-12-02 01:04:59	M-ben	irc is so much better in monospace
2018-12-02 01:05:11	M-ben	and I'd rather have it look like irc
2018-12-02 01:05:13	M-ben	but ok

2018-12-02 01:07:01	M-ben	don't connect to rooms on matrix.org and you'll probably be fine
2018-12-02 01:07:19	M-l4p1n	407 MB now, 404 MB a few hours ago, around 1pm
2018-12-02 01:07:38	M-l4p1n	It's on a 80 GB partition, don't worry X'D

2018-12-02 01:16:20	M-l4p1n	the webinterface directly talks to my homeserver so no matter where you pick the chat interface... it's the same account that will be used ben 
2018-12-02 01:16:22	~khuxkm	m-bemn
2018-12-02 01:16:30	M-ben	ohh ok nice :)
2018-12-02 01:16:46	M-ben	Matrix will be much better when it's not all done on matrix org proper
2018-12-02 01:16:58	M-ben	soooo much potential
2018-12-02 01:17:07	M-l4p1n	that's why it's federated :>
2018-12-02 01:17:28	M-ben	right but most people don't connect elsewhere
2018-12-02 01:17:43	M-l4p1n	so there's a heavy load on matrix-org's servers ^^'
2018-12-02 01:18:00	M-l4p1n	and well, i've got more than enough space for flooding logs of my server
2018-12-02 01:18:08	M-ben	you say that now ;)
2018-12-02 01:18:22	M-l4p1n	2 TB hard drive partitonned into... partitions
2018-12-02 01:18:24	M-ben	I'd recommend looking into a different log retention policy
2018-12-02 01:18:42	M-ben	oh that should be plenty
2018-12-02 01:19:01	M-ben	maybe when it gets fuller
2018-12-02 01:19:20	M-l4p1n	it's all rotated; don't worry 😁
2018-12-02 01:19:38	M-ben	good deal
2018-12-02 01:19:56	M-ben	I remember disroot.org decided to switch off matrix to xmpp
2018-12-02 01:20:47	~khuxkm	isn't matrix the one where connecting to the main server is death to your server due to size?
2018-12-02 01:21:11	M-l4p1n	yeh... Matrix-org related rooms are kinda huge
2018-12-02 01:21:37	M-l4p1n	let's see how the "Youtube-title-thing-bot" reacts, shall we ?

2018-12-02 01:50:45	%ubergeek	Only reason I got the Note 9 is because my Nexus 5 gets bad reception in some areas with TMobile
2018-12-02 01:50:51	%ubergeek	Because of the lack of bands
2018-12-02 01:50:59	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-02 01:51:06	fosslinux	i have 80GB of storage now on my phone
2018-12-02 01:51:11	fosslinux	16GB+64GB SD Card
2018-12-02 01:51:11	%ubergeek	And, it'd be my first new phone, ever.
2018-12-02 01:51:16	%ubergeek	I "deserved it" :)
2018-12-02 01:51:19	fosslinux	my friends are like wtaf

2018-12-02 01:52:13	%ubergeek	oh yeah
2018-12-02 01:52:19	fosslinux	you have 4G right?
2018-12-02 01:52:24	%ubergeek	Yes.
2018-12-02 01:52:40	%ubergeek	But, TMobile has been pushing band 12 and 93(?), which the Nexus lacks
2018-12-02 01:52:50	fosslinux	5G?
2018-12-02 01:52:54	fosslinux	whats band 12&94
2018-12-02 01:52:56	%ubergeek	So, sometimes I have 4G, move 30 ft left, and nothign
2018-12-02 01:52:59	fosslinux	s/94/93
2018-12-02 01:52:59	sedbot	<fosslinux> whats band 12&93
2018-12-02 01:53:03	%ubergeek	Just more spectrum
2018-12-02 01:53:13	%ubergeek	With better building penetration
2018-12-02 01:53:19	M-ben	I have spectrum internet
2018-12-02 01:53:24	M-ben	aka charter
2018-12-02 01:53:31	%ubergeek	I'm sorry :)
2018-12-02 01:53:49	%ubergeek	I guess at least its not DSL
2018-12-02 01:54:04	M-ben	it's 100/15 mbos
2018-12-02 01:54:12	M-ben	better than Comcast imo
2018-12-02 01:54:15	%ubergeek	not bad at all :)
2018-12-02 01:54:21	%ubergeek	I think we had this convo before...
2018-12-02 01:54:27	M-ben	probly
2018-12-02 01:54:27	%ubergeek	... and I should know better
2018-12-02 01:54:38	fosslinux	are we talking home internet now?
2018-12-02 01:54:43	M-ben	yea
2018-12-02 01:54:46	%ubergeek	Now we are :P
2018-12-02 01:54:58	fosslinux	i have ADSL2 10/1
2018-12-02 01:55:05	M-ben	oh god
2018-12-02 01:55:09	M-ben	that's miserable
2018-12-02 01:55:16	fosslinux	heck it is
2018-12-02 01:55:20	fosslinux	cant wait for NBN
2018-12-02 01:55:29	fosslinux	same price 5x data cap 25/5
2018-12-02 01:55:35	M-ben	New Broadband Network?
2018-12-02 01:55:42	M-ben	data cap on home internet??!?!?!
2018-12-02 01:55:44	M-ben	wtf
2018-12-02 01:56:17	M-brendantccmatrix	fosslinux: i've got it. it's underwhelming.
2018-12-02 01:56:33	fosslinux	data cap on home internet
2018-12-02 01:56:35	M-brendantccmatrix	but then again im on the base plan
2018-12-02 01:56:35	fosslinux	YES
2018-12-02 01:56:45	fosslinux	12.5mbps brendantcc?
2018-12-02 01:56:53	M-ben	that's so slow
2018-12-02 01:56:58	fosslinux	M-ben: national broatband internet
2018-12-02 01:57:02	M-brendantccmatrix	my friend gets 50mbps
2018-12-02 01:57:04	fosslinux	i know its DAMN SLOW
2018-12-02 01:57:12	M-ben	50 is still pretty slow tbh
2018-12-02 01:57:12	fosslinux	its not much more for the step up
2018-12-02 01:57:18	fosslinux	100 is the max M-ben
2018-12-02 01:57:23	fosslinux	100 unlimited is....'
2018-12-02 01:57:26	fosslinux	(googling)
2018-12-02 01:57:27	M-ben	that's the base level lol
2018-12-02 01:57:28	M-brendantccmatrix	ben: shut up okay?! you
2018-12-02 01:57:32	M-ben	here at least
2018-12-02 01:57:39	M-ben	well we're losing net neutrality
2018-12-02 01:57:49	M-brendantccmatrix	dag nabbit
2018-12-02 01:57:53	M-ben	won't be like this for long
2018-12-02 01:58:09	fosslinux	$90/mnth
2018-12-02 01:58:14	M-ben	ouch
2018-12-02 01:58:17	fosslinux	in usd that $65/mnth
2018-12-02 01:58:23	M-ben	$55 for me
2018-12-02 01:58:31	fosslinux	for 100/15
2018-12-02 01:58:36	fosslinux	wowwwwww
2018-12-02 01:58:40	M-ben	they did a promotion of $40/month for the first year
2018-12-02 01:58:41	fosslinux	no data cap?
2018-12-02 01:58:44	M-ben	but that's ocer
2018-12-02 01:58:47	M-ben	no data cap
2018-12-02 01:59:54	fosslinux	no gigabit intenet here
2018-12-02 02:00:09	~ben	I think charter/spectrum just announced gigabit
2018-12-02 02:00:21	~ben	I'll have to see if they'll be offering it here and how much it will cost
2018-12-02 02:00:46	~ben	I mean 100/15 is totally reasonable though
2018-12-02 02:00:53	M-brendantccmatrix	ben: nbn is an aussie thing i believe
2018-12-02 02:00:55	fosslinux	it runs over opticfibre right?
2018-12-02 02:01:00	~ben	probly
2018-12-02 02:01:03	fosslinux	nvn is an aussie thing yes
2018-12-02 02:01:12	fosslinux	yeah we used to be running copper to datacenter
2018-12-02 02:01:36	M-brendantccmatrix	riperoniii
2018-12-02 02:01:45	fosslinux	nbn is opticfibre to either node,curb,premesis
2018-12-02 02:02:00	fosslinux	node up to 700m away, copper the rest of way
2018-12-02 02:02:09	%ubergeek	I'd probably uump on gigabit...  But I have not seen any bandwidth issues, at all, at home
2018-12-02 02:02:14	fosslinux	curb: fibre to the curb, copper down to your house
2018-12-02 02:02:26	fosslinux	premeses: fibre all the way to your house
2018-12-02 02:02:31	%ubergeek	I mean, I guess if I had 1000 ssh connections open, it might be noticeable :)
2018-12-02 02:02:35	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-02 02:02:51	fosslinux	i realised on bsd~team i've got 3 mosh sessions some of whicha re ded
2018-12-02 02:03:15	%ubergeek	I was out camping, and using 2G to connect to ~team over ssh.  Mosh glitched a couple of times, and that was it
2018-12-02 02:03:51	M-brendantccmatrix	be careful! don't wanna trigger hetzner :p
2018-12-02 02:04:17	fosslinux	lol

2018-12-02 02:05:37	~ben	I've only had issues when my desktop hogs all the net (it and the pi are the only things connected with ethernet)
2018-12-02 02:05:41	fosslinux	self compile :P
2018-12-02 02:06:01	%ubergeek	No compilers allowed on prod either :)

2018-12-02 02:06:17	~ben	mosh ports are blocked at work but somehow ssh is super stable and feels like no lag

2018-12-02 04:23:34	~ben	how goes it
2018-12-02 04:24:10	rdh	Oh pretty good. Trying to figure out what I want to do with my night
2018-12-02 04:24:21	rdh	How's everyone in the institute?
2018-12-02 04:24:32	~ben	ooh good question
2018-12-02 04:24:39	~ben	i haven't been on there in a couple days :(
2018-12-02 04:24:54	xvetrd	(i log in every day but do nothing)
2018-12-02 04:25:06	xvetrd	for like the week ive been on
2018-12-02 04:25:35	~ben	i've been meaning to write stuff for cosmic.voyage and do some cool compiled cgi on ~institue but i keep getting distracted
2018-12-02 04:25:42	~ben	advent of code has started
2018-12-02 04:25:46	~ben	so that's fun
2018-12-02 04:25:51	rdh	Oh shoot it's december.
2018-12-02 04:25:54	rdh	Maybe I'll do that.
2018-12-02 04:26:08	~ben	we've got a tilde leaderboard going if you'd like to hop on
2018-12-02 04:26:20	~ben	part 2 takes a bit of optimization
2018-12-02 04:26:24	rdh	Naah, I'm not much of a programmer
2018-12-02 04:26:36	xvetrd	does the leaderboard require one of them logins i dont have?
2018-12-02 04:26:43	~ben	you can use github
2018-12-02 04:26:55	xvetrd	i dont have a github anymore
2018-12-02 04:27:03	~ben	no?
2018-12-02 04:27:11	xvetrd	furreal im that kind of person
2018-12-02 04:27:19	~ben	have you moved on to sr.ht ?
2018-12-02 04:27:34	~ben	or where have you moved
2018-12-02 04:27:48	slipyx	tildegit where else
2018-12-02 04:27:55	~ben	lol same
2018-12-02 04:28:05	xvetrd	im shifting to CVS on my local machine. never got into the whole, 'contributing' aspect
2018-12-02 04:28:09	M-brendantccmatrix	tildegit ftw m8
2018-12-02 04:28:27	rdh	I've been considering figuring out cvs since it comes in openbsd base
2018-12-02 04:28:34	xvetrd	i think i had one accepted pull request for a language feature that got deprecated in the next update
2018-12-02 04:28:41	rdh	maybe that's what I'll do tonight: Read some man pages
2018-12-02 04:28:57	~ben	i've never used cvs tbh
2018-12-02 04:29:09	xvetrd	rdh: its weird at first. def not git in many ways
2018-12-02 04:29:22	 *	TildeBot rocks!
2018-12-02 04:29:24	xvetrd	like, commits arent the same. checkout isnt the same,
2018-12-02 04:29:26	rdh	Well, git was made to be very unlike cvs and svn
2018-12-02 04:29:34	~ben	contributing is great
2018-12-02 04:30:06	ahriman	rdh i think most of the reason openbsd uses cvs is because it's "good enough" for them, and if they don't see a need to change something they won't, so i'd say learn about several vcs choices and pick the one you like
2018-12-02 04:30:07	rdh	Well like I said, I'm not much of a programmer. I mostly use git for keeping notes
2018-12-02 04:30:41	rdh	I know that's how they make their choices, but in the past I've found thier good enough is also good enough for me
2018-12-02 04:30:46	rdh	And saves me the trouble of having to install something else
2018-12-02 04:30:47	ahriman	this is true
2018-12-02 04:30:57	xvetrd	sames
2018-12-02 04:31:31	~ben	work uses perforce
2018-12-02 04:31:32	xvetrd	when you use OpenBSD vetted stuff, you know who the vetters were
2018-12-02 04:31:32	ahriman	plus they have every last semicolon documented properly in the man pages so it's all there if you want to learn it
2018-12-02 04:31:35	~ben	so that's interesting
2018-12-02 04:31:54	xvetrd	well, the CVS manpages aren't perfect
2018-12-02 04:32:05	~ben	what about walgreens
2018-12-02 04:32:12	xvetrd	there was an OpenCVS project a while ago, and they rewrote a lot of stuff
2018-12-02 04:32:22	xvetrd	but it was never ready for production and is kind of dormant now
2018-12-02 04:32:42	xvetrd	its in the source, and you can use it, and look at the man pages, but it takes more work
2018-12-02 04:32:58	ahriman	rdh: on openbsd, the cvs infopage is also hella informative
2018-12-02 04:33:21	ahriman	it's basically a book on cvs
2018-12-02 04:33:29	rdh	tbh I don't even know how to use info
2018-12-02 04:33:37	ahriman	'info cvs', enter to follow links
2018-12-02 04:34:06	ahriman	backspace to go back
2018-12-02 04:34:19	rdh	I guess the only stuff I've ever tried to look up just didn't have info pages then.
2018-12-02 04:34:26	rdh	This is exactly waht I thought it should be
2018-12-02 04:34:47	ahriman	:)
2018-12-02 04:35:14	xvetrd	shift+backspace apparently brings up the help
2018-12-02 04:35:20	xvetrd	i just now learned
2018-12-02 04:35:39	xvetrd	and 'q' quits all of it, not just the help window
2018-12-02 04:35:47	xvetrd	the more you know
2018-12-02 04:35:52	ahriman	lol
2018-12-02 04:35:59	~ben	q quits a handful of things
2018-12-02 04:36:11	xvetrd	yeah but the WHOLE thing?
2018-12-02 04:36:14	~ben	yeah
2018-12-02 04:36:25	~ben	that's what i'd expect idk
2018-12-02 04:36:32	ahriman	C-x 0 to exit the help
2018-12-02 04:36:57	ahriman	infopages are a Gnu thing so expect Gnu-like shortcuts and behavior
2018-12-02 04:37:11	npa	i mean, if you really wanna quit, type ~. on a newline ;)
2018-12-02 04:37:13	xvetrd	holy crap it says right there when you open it up
2018-12-02 04:37:19	xvetrd	what is wrong with me
2018-12-02 04:37:22	ahriman	lolll
2018-12-02 04:37:25	~ben	lel
2018-12-02 04:37:30	~ben	reading is hard
2018-12-02 04:37:55	xvetrd	look
2018-12-02 04:38:00	xvetrd	sometimes yes
2018-12-02 04:38:00	rdh	This is the reason forums are so hostile to new users ;)
2018-12-02 04:38:23	~ben	same reason rtfm includes an 'f'
2018-12-02 04:38:30	ahriman	often i subconsciously skip the first few lines of what im reading because im so used to skimming to the 'meat', so i see where xvetrd is coming from
2018-12-02 04:38:39	~ben	yeah same
2018-12-02 04:38:44	~ben	but still
2018-12-02 04:38:45	xvetrd	ive got like four windows of things im trying to read
2018-12-02 04:39:08	xvetrd	NYRB has a new 1700pg doorstopper out and i have to know those deets
2018-12-02 04:39:17	ahriman	dayummm
2018-12-02 04:40:17	rdh	While we're talking about things we just learned but would have known with some light reading: the -F flag on ls(1) will append a / on directories.
2018-12-02 04:40:25	rdh	Would have loved having that one in my back pocket
2018-12-02 04:40:37	xvetrd	rdh: bruh thats the only way to ls
2018-12-02 04:40:46	ahriman	rdh that's one of my first aliases i make on new systems
2018-12-02 04:40:48	npa	alias l="ls -lah" my dude
2018-12-02 04:40:58	~ben	^^
2018-12-02 04:41:10	npa	don't you have colours to differentiate dirs?
2018-12-02 04:41:19	rdh	Not on every system.
2018-12-02 04:41:19	ahriman	npa not on bsd unless you -G
2018-12-02 04:41:28	xvetrd	and why would you do that
2018-12-02 04:41:35	ahriman	and i think that's only fbsd
2018-12-02 04:41:46	xvetrd	and why would you fbsd
2018-12-02 04:41:47	~ben	ls is an alias for ls --color=auto
2018-12-02 04:42:14	~ben	i like to do l=ls -alh --group-directories-first
2018-12-02 04:42:25	npa	its an env variable for me, i'm running ohmyzsh
2018-12-02 04:42:32	~ben	fish shell 4 me
2018-12-02 04:42:38	npa	# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"
2018-12-02 04:43:07	rdh	lol i'm not about to install fish on hundreds of servers i log into once a month
2018-12-02 04:43:23	rdh	No, I've learned to embrace defaults.
2018-12-02 04:43:29	rdh	So long as they're sane, anyway.
2018-12-02 04:43:36	ahriman	rdh same
2018-12-02 04:43:46	~ben	i don't log in to hundreds of servers
2018-12-02 04:44:07	ahriman	same about defaults, i don't log into hundreds of servers either
2018-12-02 04:44:08	xvetrd	w o o f i just downloaded an excerpt frm this book thinking it was going to be like, 10-15 pages and its 41. woof
2018-12-02 04:44:16	ahriman	woof
2018-12-02 04:44:42	ahriman	rdh if you get a wild hair up your ass and want to see what fish is about, i have it installed
2018-12-02 04:44:47	xvetrd	oh its straight up the first chapter
2018-12-02 04:45:17	ahriman	ive personally been a little curious about it
2018-12-02 04:45:28	ahriman	though the most exotic shell i've ever used is zsh
2018-12-02 04:45:46	ahriman	and nadvsh once for like an hour
2018-12-02 04:45:58	ahriman	until it got really annoying
2018-12-02 04:46:00	~ben	fish is great
2018-12-02 04:46:13	rdh	@ahriman right on, maybe I'll give it a go
2018-12-02 04:46:14	~ben	all the machines i log in to have fish installed

2018-12-02 04:46:22	~ben	i don't mind bash
2018-12-02 04:46:41	~ben	but i'd much rather use fish shell
2018-12-02 04:46:58	rdh	korn shell though
2018-12-02 04:47:01	~ben	nah
2018-12-02 04:47:16	M-brendantccmatrix	init install fish shell on DEKTOP-QEICUHI...

2018-12-02 04:49:29	~ben	what?
2018-12-02 04:49:47	ahriman	rdh apparently it has a nifty scripting language ::but i've never used it::
2018-12-02 04:49:55	M-brendantccmatrix	this is the first time you mentioned fish ben
2018-12-02 04:49:56	npa	i think its actually scripting
2018-12-02 04:49:59	npa	ninja'd dw
2018-12-02 04:50:13	~ben	it is definitely not the first time i've talked about fish shell
2018-12-02 04:50:18	npa	even using zsh i still write #!/bin/bash
2018-12-02 04:50:41	~ben	fish scripting is fine but i write bash scripts for portability
2018-12-02 04:50:45	M-brendantccmatrix	ben: its teh first time ive seen you mention it soooooooooo reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2018-12-02 04:50:52	~ben	it's literally not
2018-12-02 04:51:07	M-brendantccmatrix	it's the first time i've seen you mention it

2018-12-02 05:09:14	~ben	nothing on your end
2018-12-02 05:10:22	rdh	Okay so I'm reading the cvs manpage and honestly this looks great
2018-12-02 05:10:40	rdh	Like I get for something like the linux kernal why you'd wnat more
2018-12-02 05:10:52	rdh	But for personal projects, why use something more complicated?
2018-12-02 05:11:26	~ben	muscle memory
2018-12-02 05:11:35	ahriman	ive had a thing for mercurial but lately ive been using git because of tildegit
2018-12-02 05:12:19	~ben	for me git is the de-facto solution for it
2018-12-02 05:13:17	ahriman	i do like git a lot now that ive actually put it to use, plus it's so widespread i feel like it's become the 'default', so i feel i should get acquainted with it more
2018-12-02 05:13:17	~ben	would be a lot of extra cognitive load to learn anything else
2018-12-02 05:14:06	~ben	sure git is absurdly obtuse and unintelligible but stockholm syndrome? idk
2018-12-02 05:14:31	rdh	from the cvs man page: in fact, five commands are sufficient to use (and contribute to) the source repository.
2018-12-02 05:15:37	~ben	git clone; git add; git commit; git send-email
2018-12-02 05:16:02	xvetrd	git can send emails?
2018-12-02 05:16:06	~ben	unless those five commands are including configs?
2018-12-02 05:16:09	~ben	yeah
2018-12-02 05:16:10	rdh	See, you already know the commands!
2018-12-02 05:16:22	~ben	https://man.sr.ht/git.sr.ht/send-email.md
2018-12-02 05:16:24	TildeBot	For everyone - man.sr.ht https://bhh.sh/2bd
2018-12-02 05:16:51	~ben	but if you're on a tilde with a pre-existing mailserver you only have to configure the to address
2018-12-02 05:17:34	~ben	would those commands be the same as cvs?
2018-12-02 05:17:44	~ben	i suppose the github workflow is a bit different
2018-12-02 05:18:19	xvetrd	i don't know. the Obsd folk send patches on the mailing list
2018-12-02 05:18:23	~deepend	so does someone run a matrix server or is that just a public matrix server that brendantcc_lounge is using?
2018-12-02 05:18:41	~ben	ah ok nice
2018-12-02 05:18:49	~ben	i've been wanting to get back into the mailing list workflow
2018-12-02 05:18:57	~ben	but there are too many projects on github and the like
2018-12-02 05:19:04	~ben	it's l4p1n's
2018-12-02 05:19:14	M-ben	hi
2018-12-02 05:19:15	~deepend	ah nice
2018-12-02 05:19:38	~ben	so #tilde-meta@l4p1n.ch is linked to this channel with matrix-appservice-irc
2018-12-02 05:20:08	~ben	which iiuc you should be able to join from any matrix server that has federation set up properly
2018-12-02 05:22:31	rdh	Oh man
2018-12-02 05:22:40	rdh	So I was going to do the advent of code, then
2018-12-02 05:22:45	rdh	To play, please identify yourself via one of these services:
2018-12-02 05:22:56	rdh	HARD pass
2018-12-02 05:23:05	ahriman	ben: if i wanted to create a private git repo for thebsd.club, could i hypothetically run "git add *" rather than each individual file/dir?
2018-12-02 05:23:06	xvetrd	rdh: sames
2018-12-02 05:23:22	npa	if you want I can send the challenges to you
2018-12-02 05:23:24	~ben	i just authed with github
2018-12-02 05:23:28	npa	^
2018-12-02 05:23:42	~ben	ahriman: ?
2018-12-02 05:24:00	~ben	git add just puts stuff from the working directory to the index
2018-12-02 05:24:32	~ben	"private" is something that is handled by the hosting if you decide to host it somehwere
2018-12-02 05:25:14	ahriman	im more referring to pushing all the files to tildegit, so i wouldn't need to git add each individual file then
2018-12-02 05:25:51	~ben	i mean the remote is just a copy of your local repository
2018-12-02 05:26:04	rdh	Well you have to git add to tell git what to push
2018-12-02 05:26:18	~ben	but if you have the right stuff in .gitignore you can do git add . or git add * or git add --all
2018-12-02 05:26:36	rdh	didn't know about --all
2018-12-02 05:26:41	rdh	Seems weird when * works
2018-12-02 05:26:51	~ben	* should skip files beginning with .
2018-12-02 05:27:03	rdh	Ahh, good point. Hadn't thought about that.
2018-12-02 05:27:22	~ben	there's also git commit -a
2018-12-02 05:27:30	ahriman	ok cool
2018-12-02 05:27:41	~ben	which stages and commits all modified files, skipping untracked ones
2018-12-02 05:27:56	~ben	ugh i think i'm beginning to see your point
2018-12-02 05:28:01	rdh	ahriman why not just use tilde.institute as your git server?
2018-12-02 05:28:04	~ben	it's needlessly complex for most projects
2018-12-02 05:28:35	~ben	cd ~ && mkdir mynewproject.git && cd mynewproject.git && git init --bare
2018-12-02 05:28:53	~ben	git clone ahriman@tilde.institute:mynewprojec.git

2018-12-02 05:36:12	rdh	The only ctrl code I can remember is ctrl-i for tab
2018-12-02 05:36:24	rdh	And that's only because my last phone had a ctrl key but not a tab key
2018-12-02 05:37:41	xvetrd	heres a fun one: ctrl+u on a unix shell deletes the line your were writing, like an "undo"
2018-12-02 05:37:50	xvetrd	even works in weechat
2018-12-02 05:38:17	rdh	I think that even works when typing in passwords
2018-12-02 05:38:30	~ben	it puts it on a killring
2018-12-02 05:38:37	~ben	ctrl+y pastes from the killring

2018-12-02 05:39:12	~ben	(these are standard readline keybinds)
2018-12-02 05:39:22	~ben	ctrl+d simulates and EOF
2018-12-02 05:39:34	~ben	should kill most REPLs
2018-12-02 05:39:56	~ben	if you're at a shell, alt+. will paste the last arg from the last run command
2018-12-02 05:40:14	~ben	^ this is hugely useful
2018-12-02 05:40:33	npa	ctrl-a ctrl-e ctrl-u are all useful too
2018-12-02 05:40:53	npa	and i guess ctrl-k
2018-12-02 05:41:31	ahriman	i use the shit out of $! on the command line
2018-12-02 05:41:38	~ben	like maybe  you do vim /long/path/to/file
2018-12-02 05:41:52	~ben	then you can do $compiler <alt+.>
2018-12-02 05:41:55	fosslinux	nuts
2018-12-02 05:42:05	~ben	and it will fill out the same last arg that you passed to vim
2018-12-02 05:42:17	npa	tbh with that one benharri, just use !$compiler %
2018-12-02 05:42:20	rdh	Yeah that's one of the most powerful things I've ever heard about.
2018-12-02 05:42:34	~ben	wait what is $! again
2018-12-02 05:42:37	rdh	Why don't you ever see that in those life hack listicles?
2018-12-02 05:42:47	~ben	cause they're not true h4x0rz
2018-12-02 05:43:06	fosslinux	ahriman:
2018-12-02 05:44:41	ahriman	ben say you run vim /etc/httpd.conf then you're like oh shit, im not root, then the next command you run can be sudo $! and it will fill in vim /etc/httpd.conf
2018-12-02 05:45:10	~ben	oh i'd just do sudo vim <alt+.>
2018-12-02 05:45:14	~ben	not sure fish has $!
2018-12-02 05:45:27	ahriman	it may not, i think it's a bourne/korn thing
2018-12-02 05:45:45	~ben	fish: $! is not a valid variable in fish.
2018-12-02 05:45:47	~ben	:(
2018-12-02 05:46:00	npa	!! is cool too
2018-12-02 05:46:09	fosslinux	!! is very cool
2018-12-02 05:46:14	~ben	ehh up arrow, home is not really any slower for me
2018-12-02 05:46:16	npa	but i often just up arrow, ctrl-a then type what I want
2018-12-02 05:46:17	rdh	isn't htat bash only though?
2018-12-02 05:46:19	rdh	isn't htat bash only though?
2018-12-02 05:46:39	npa	zsh has it at least
2018-12-02 05:48:00	fosslinux	zsh++
2018-12-02 05:49:55	xvetrd	you can set -o vi in most shells too
2018-12-02 05:50:14	rdh	Why vi when you can use ed?
2018-12-02 05:50:30	xvetrd	because i cant scroll with ed
2018-12-02 05:50:34	xvetrd	g o s h
2018-12-02 05:50:42	fosslinux	vi is bad
2018-12-02 05:50:46	fosslinux	s/bad/good
2018-12-02 05:50:47	sedbot	<fosslinux> vi is good
2018-12-02 05:50:48	fosslinux	ed is bad
2018-12-02 05:50:58	rdh	Sorry, ed is the standard editor
2018-12-02 05:51:06	xvetrd	ed is the standard editor
2018-12-02 05:51:11	~ben	alias vim=ed
2018-12-02 05:51:19	rdh	wow, RUDE
2018-12-02 05:51:26	~ben	alias emacs=ed

2018-12-02 05:51:59	xvetrd	alias emacs=libreoffice
2018-12-02 05:52:04	~ben	but tbh it's not very useful when we have more than a dumb terminal
2018-12-02 05:52:07	slipyx	alias ed=logout
2018-12-02 05:52:19	~ben	lol
2018-12-02 05:52:32	xvetrd	ed is fun tho
2018-12-02 05:52:41	xvetrd	its not great these days, but its fun
2018-12-02 05:52:54	xvetrd	and you can script with it, which is cool too
2018-12-02 05:53:00	~ben	oh yeah, it's pretty brilliant considering the restraints they had at the time
2018-12-02 05:53:34	xvetrd	its literally the only manner to edit things on a hardcopy terminal
2018-12-02 05:53:35	rdh	ed is great if you can remember what you're working on
2018-12-02 05:54:08	xvetrd	rdh: you will, on a hardcopy terminal. just pull the paper back up

2018-12-02 06:00:15	~ben	there are so many options for hosting git!
2018-12-02 06:00:26	ahriman	(the wp-bomb is a 1.1GB dictionary i serve to bots looking for /wp-admin/ or /wp-login.php)

2018-12-02 08:44:11	ahriman	i wrote makefootballpools.com in php. i used c# for work at one point OH I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT JOB
2018-12-02 08:44:19	ahriman	it was a 6 month contract
2018-12-02 08:44:25	ahriman	i need to put that on my resume
2018-12-02 08:44:31	~ben	yea do it!
2018-12-02 08:44:44	~ben	might as well list it as c#/.net
2018-12-02 08:44:59	ahriman	C# to build and maintain a custom piece of software to interact with their database because they were pulling info out fucking manually
2018-12-02 08:45:49	~ben	lel
2018-12-02 08:46:00	~ben	i mean same
2018-12-02 08:46:11	~ben	millions of lines of legacy code
2018-12-02 08:47:03	ahriman	oh jeez
2018-12-02 08:47:11	ahriman	i actually really liked C#
2018-12-02 08:47:42	~ben	yeah it's super pleasant to use tbh
2018-12-02 08:47:55	~ben	one of my favorite things is the linq function syntax
2018-12-02 08:48:09	~ben	lets me pretend it's a bit functional
2018-12-02 08:48:48	ahriman	it was easy to pick up (i think i learned it in like 3 days to where I could actually use it pragmatically)
2018-12-02 08:48:56	~ben	for sure
2018-12-02 08:49:02	~ben	super friendly syntax
2018-12-02 08:49:15	~ben	visual studio or nah?
2018-12-02 08:49:16	ahriman	but it's really powerful too, and its sql integration was pretty off the chain
2018-12-02 08:49:21	ahriman	nah i used sharpdevelop
2018-12-02 08:50:04	~ben	ah i'm not familiar with that one
2018-12-02 08:50:13	~ben	entityframework is nutso
2018-12-02 08:50:17	~ben	nutso good
2018-12-02 08:50:57	npa	why does grep "[a-z]" capture french letters when i'm en_AU?
2018-12-02 08:51:34	~ben	french letters like ç?
2018-12-02 08:51:40	npa	e with an accent

2018-12-02 08:58:21	npa	i mean america was colonised/whatever by franch even
2018-12-02 08:58:26	npa	franch
2018-12-02 08:58:27	SinaCutie	Maybe 'cause French is a langugae in the Commonwealth? We have the Swedish å and we don't use it ourselves.

2018-12-02 08:59:17	npa	i don't think so
2018-12-02 08:59:23	npa	but ben, they are super colonisers
2018-12-02 08:59:23	SinaCutie	I know you *have* them, but they're not actively in use, which is why they're generally not available on an American English keyboard.
2018-12-02 08:59:27	~ben	é isn't only in french
2018-12-02 08:59:30	ahriman	the only diacritical mark still used today in the US is the umlaut, and it's mostly by The New Yorker
2018-12-02 08:59:40	ahriman	oh yeah e-accent-acute is too
2018-12-02 08:59:43	npa	how do you guys write eclair

2018-12-02 08:59:58	npa	what about facade
2018-12-02 09:00:00	~ben	in most cases just like that
2018-12-02 09:00:04	ahriman	with the cedille accent

2018-12-02 09:01:33	login	Well, based on the definition of the umlaut, it would apply well to cooperate

2018-12-02 09:02:01	ahriman	you'll see cooperate spelled with an umlaut
2018-12-02 09:02:10	login	I remember pronounce cafe (kaef), and being corrected (because they didn't use an accent)
2018-12-02 09:02:20	npa	i mean, we use it without the hyphen, but we base it off the compounded one

2018-12-02 10:21:45	login	I mean, why not offer an alternative simultaneously? What are they hoping will happen? People will start bicycling?
2018-12-02 10:22:02	M-l4p1n	Idk
2018-12-02 10:22:10	login	Gourmet Instant Ramen instantly makes me feel hungry lol
2018-12-02 10:22:21	M-l4p1n	I don't know much how the French politics work...
2018-12-02 10:22:47	login	neither do i, but this price increase has to be followed up by offering cheaper alternatives..
2018-12-02 10:23:25	login	hey hope undistorting the gas market by increasing taxes on it (to include externalities into the price) will fix a wrong
2018-12-02 10:23:33	login	*they hope
2018-12-02 10:24:46	login	well, they're right, and actually, prices ought to be much higher for everything than they currently are, and we're actually paying less than we ought to pay for the long-term consequences of our action...
2018-12-02 10:24:49	M-l4p1n	but peps want to stay with they confort and stuff... Idk what to think nor what to say. I haven't seen the news of 7:30pm yesterday because a friend of my mom threw a party
2018-12-02 10:24:55	login	Basically, we're eating the future...
2018-12-02 10:25:24	login	party before it's too late...
2018-12-02 10:25:35	login	it's all going to end in the next 50 years most probably anyway
2018-12-02 10:27:25	M-l4p1n	in Switzerland, it's still calm and stuff. Maybe because the politic system allows people to come up with idea, change the law and have a bit of power in they hands when they go voting
2018-12-02 10:28:38	login	Sovereign money failed in switzerland... i think it was a wonderful idea...
2018-12-02 10:29:02	login	the government gets to decide whom to loan money out to... and commercial banks become little more than middle-men
2018-12-02 10:29:25	M-l4p1n	How was it called again ?
2018-12-02 10:29:35	M-l4p1n	"La monnaie pleine" ?
2018-12-02 10:31:20	M-l4p1n	saying that the electronic money HAS to come from the BNS ? The idea was good, but putting too much power in the BNS is kinda a bad idea. If we see that the financial system is starting to fail on us, people will come up with an idea
2018-12-02 10:33:27	login	I mean, the current system is every bank trying to become the BNS...
2018-12-02 10:33:44	login	Or the "commercial" branch of the BNS
2018-12-02 10:33:59	login	By becoming the largest bank
2018-12-02 10:34:58	login	I think it's bonkers that banks get to make money by borrowing from the central bank at one rate, and borrowing from normal depositors at a lower rate...

2018-12-02 14:55:41	mushmouth	i thought you were at a mental hospital or something
2018-12-02 14:55:44	mushmouth	so i was scared for you
2018-12-02 14:55:47	desvox	aha, nah

2018-12-02 14:59:09	desvox	something about that whole experience has pushed me into a weird place mentally
2018-12-02 14:59:42	desvox	and you're far from the only person ive fallen out of touch with since then

2018-12-02 17:46:56	desvox	hope that gets worked out
2018-12-02 17:48:48	+jan6|	I'd assume the user needs to have been X time old, or have interacted with your instance for it to show, maybe?
2018-12-02 17:49:11	login	I wonder how Mastodon does inter-instance communication...
2018-12-02 17:49:25	login	I remember Diaspora, but Mastodon seems to have made the biggest splash
2018-12-02 17:49:59	~deepend	I think they all federate very simular.. 
2018-12-02 17:50:16	+jan6|	I wouldn't think it feasible to query a list of possibly-thousands-of-users at every search
2018-12-02 17:51:37	+jan6|	I bet federating is easy, you have a global update url, and whenever somebody follows another instance, your instance will start grabbing stuff from the other's global url...or well, that's just a guess

2018-12-02 17:52:34	ubergeek|dex	It uses webpubsub, to check for updates, though
2018-12-02 17:52:53	+jan6|	we pub sub, how creative name...
2018-12-02 17:53:17	ubergeek|dex	Basically, fancy RSS :)
2018-12-02 17:53:51	+jan6|	^kinda what I was saying, too
2018-12-02 17:54:03	ubergeek|dex	basically, yeah
2018-12-02 17:54:41	ubergeek|dex	Diaspora has it's own protocol, not exactly sure how it works, or what it's called
2018-12-02 17:54:42	+jan6|	what's the dex @ your nick, btw?
2018-12-02 17:54:59	ubergeek|dex	I do think it can speak OStatus (Older ActivityPub)
2018-12-02 17:55:18	ubergeek|dex	Oh, just got weechat runnin in termux on Samsung Dex
2018-12-02 17:55:26	+jan6|	yeah, I've heard it can be used interchangeabky
2018-12-02 17:55:38	+jan6|	oh,cool
2018-12-02 17:55:53	ubergeek|dex	Maybe?  Its possible, since ActivityPub discard unknown nouns and verbs, if I recall
2018-12-02 17:56:24	+jan6|	so you'll lose a bit, but it shoukd kinda work I guess
2018-12-02 17:56:40	ubergeek|dex	More or less...  I *think*

2018-12-02 18:03:53	desvox	one thing to keep in mind with fediverse is that mastodon isnt even the only server

2018-12-02 18:04:27	desvox	i see strange behaviour when viewing pleroma profiles from masto instances

2018-12-02 18:05:59	%ubergeek	yeah, there was some consternation between the author of pleroma and mastodon over those quirks

2018-12-02 22:49:40	cdmnky	but if you're really unlucky, you say you're going then get hit by truck-kun 5 seconds later

2018-12-02 22:51:27	cdmnky	this scene literally happens in the first two minutes of episode 1 lol
2018-12-02 22:51:32	M-M-brendantcc	imagine if the bridge was running on tilde.team, and the tilde-meta channel on l4p1n.ch was going off of that

2018-12-02 23:12:33	cdmnky	tbf though, the ELAN driver is horrible
2018-12-02 23:13:14	cdmnky	they don't change the hardware, but change the ACPI ID of the touchpad, and hardcode all of them to be detected, without even taking the two seconds to add the one line in their own linux driver lol
2018-12-02 23:14:18	cdmnky	it took me two days to figure out why my touchpad wasn't working on my brand new laptop, and learned how to submit a patch request so I wouldn't have to compile a kernel on it all the time
2018-12-02 23:20:04	 *	jan6 dies of procrastination and lazyness
2018-12-02 23:20:20	~ben	then you still have to get the patched kernel somehow
2018-12-02 23:20:29	~ben	it takes a looong time to get onto your device from upstream
2018-12-02 23:22:24	mushmouth	nice to always have diffs
2018-12-02 23:24:51	mushmouth	you know because linux and bsd are open source you can do the patching yourself :P
2018-12-02 23:25:37	cdmnky	I originally submitted in the first week of july, was signed off in a week or so, and merged into stable by the first week of august

2018-12-03 04:36:33	~ben	i've had really good luck with debian and derivatives
2018-12-03 04:38:29	hyperboredoubt	If I end up in a weird, Serial Experiments Lain type of predicament, I'm blaming y'all.

2018-12-03 04:44:16	stompy	i guess its a custom chromium build
2018-12-03 04:44:18	ahriman	i used ubuntu in my freshman year of college because it had better hardware support out of the box than anything, this was in 2007
2018-12-03 04:44:21	stompy	with all the creepy google shit removed
2018-12-03 04:44:24	stompy	and supposedly speedier

2018-12-03 05:09:21	~ben	i'd rather you not
2018-12-03 05:09:29	~ben	there's a reason we shut down the previous bridge

2018-12-03 05:13:44	ahriman	hyperboredoubt: be careful of other irc networks from the tildeverse and friends. irc has a lot of alt-righters and neonazis now, especially efnet
2018-12-03 05:14:32	ahriman	but as far as cool irc networks, there's here, there's tilde.town, there's hashbang.sh, there's freenode.net
2018-12-03 05:14:33	~deepend	goto newnet... theres almost nobody on there.. so less chance of finding nuts on it :P 
2018-12-03 05:14:44	hyperboredoubt	I was a lurker on #Bibanon on Rizon. They preserve internet culture.
2018-12-03 05:14:55	ahriman	i used to be on rizon like 15 years ago
2018-12-03 05:15:35	~ben	freenode and oftc are the place to go for open-source projects
2018-12-03 05:15:44	hyperboredoubt	Yeah, I've noticed a huge influx of right-wingers in the past few years especially in relation to image boards.
2018-12-03 05:16:03	~ben	alright time to focus for aoc
2018-12-03 05:16:20	dpc	i'm generally on freenode and esper

2018-12-03 05:18:20	TildeBot	&lrm; 
2018-12-03 05:19:02	hyperboredoubt	I already checked it out, ben. It doesn't lead to anything except a giant pound sign and an exclamation mark.
2018-12-03 05:19:25	~ben	run the command, or view the page source if you want to skip getting yelled at
2018-12-03 05:19:53	slipyx	yeah its one of those "tildes" that require an initiation
2018-12-03 05:20:05	slipyx	gotta be these leet to join our crew
2018-12-03 05:20:18	slipyx	at least its not winning a game of pong over telnet
2018-12-03 05:20:32	~ben	lel srsly
2018-12-03 05:21:01	hyperboredoubt	"Hey, you found the source code!
2018-12-03 05:21:03	hyperboredoubt	  That is a sign you hopefully know better than to blindly run unknown commands
2018-12-03 05:21:05	hyperboredoubt	  from the internet and/or are a curious person. We like you already.
2018-12-03 05:21:07	hyperboredoubt	  What this command will actually do, is set you up with a free "shell" account
2018-12-03 05:21:09	hyperboredoubt	  on one of our servers, that you can use as you see fit. It will also set you
2018-12-03 05:21:11	slipyx	yeah and then you find out its only a p3 1ghz
2018-12-03 05:21:11	hyperboredoubt	  up with email, IRC, and other things on your shell, so you can keep in touch
2018-12-03 05:21:13	hyperboredoubt	  and learn/make awesome things with us.
2018-12-03 05:21:15	hyperboredoubt	  Don't trust us? Good! You probably don't know us (yet) so you shouldn't.

2018-12-03 05:21:53	dpc	sdf?
2018-12-03 05:22:03	ahriman	sdf does not make you do anything like that

2018-12-03 05:22:45	~ben	blinkenshell.org is the one with the tiny resource limits
2018-12-03 05:23:23	dpc	speaking of limits

2018-12-03 05:25:13	hyperboredoubt	Is "blinkenshell" a reference to that "blinkenlights" joke about Germans?

2018-12-03 07:41:55	rgdrake	when I game, it's usually Modded Minecraft

2018-12-03 07:46:08	rgdrake	s/ultimage/ultimate
2018-12-03 07:46:09	sedbot	<rgdrake> expensive? the ultimate lego set?
2018-12-03 07:46:29	~ben	heh it's not for everyone
2018-12-03 07:46:32	~deepend	i think its expensive.  lol  i have 4 copies of it.. but still think its expensive
2018-12-03 07:46:39	~ben	i haven't been on in a while but it can be fun
2018-12-03 07:46:40	npa	i think i must have spent like 4k hours in it at least
2018-12-03 07:46:46	~ben	damn
2018-12-03 07:46:56	npa	i went nuts for it many years ago
2018-12-03 07:47:08	npa	i think I got it in alpha 1.2.x
2018-12-03 07:47:21	~ben	i only have like 1k hours on my entire steam library
2018-12-03 07:47:27	~deepend	i mostly enjoy just building.. never really got into it otherwise
2018-12-03 07:47:33	rgdrake	I got it, I think, 4.something
2018-12-03 07:47:38	npa	i think I've got around that much too ben
2018-12-03 07:47:43	~ben	i got it right out of alpha
2018-12-03 07:47:45	npa	maybe 1.2k?

2018-12-03 07:48:09	~ben	1.2k yeah
2018-12-03 07:48:23	~ben	i suppose it's not counting anything from blizzard and gog and consoles
2018-12-03 07:48:37	npa	ah, i don't have any of those
2018-12-03 07:48:38	~ben	i put somewhere between 600-700 hours into destiny 2 last winter
2018-12-03 07:48:51	~ben	that was an interesting time
2018-12-03 07:49:07	rgdrake	not that you all are boring, but coffee isn't working, but maybe I won't have the dream I did, goodnight again
2018-12-03 07:49:13	~ben	i only mention gog because that's where i have the witcher 3
2018-12-03 07:49:18	~ben	heh no worries
2018-12-03 07:49:23	~ben	i'm definitely up past my bedtime
2018-12-03 07:49:38	npa	is there a timebot here?
2018-12-03 07:49:40	npa	!timefor ben
2018-12-03 07:49:40	~ben	but i'm still fighting with elixir to get aoc part 2
2018-12-03 07:49:53	npa	of day 3?
2018-12-03 07:49:56	~ben	not that i know of
2018-12-03 07:50:09	~ben	it'd be tricky cause there are people here from many different tildes
2018-12-03 07:50:21	npa	tru
2018-12-03 07:50:36	~ben	it'd have to have its own internal db of timezones
2018-12-03 07:51:08	npa	i might try and solve these in prolog
2018-12-03 07:51:26	npa	but it requires pre-processing, so its not as fun :(
2018-12-03 07:52:41	~ben	elixir is immutable so some of these are kinda goofy and i keep ending up using enum.reduce
2018-12-03 07:53:24	npa	ditto with prolog, but there *are* imperative features, but they're shit
2018-12-03 07:53:35	npa	it's entirely pattern matching lol
2018-12-03 07:53:46	~ben	pattern matching is nice
2018-12-03 07:54:02	~ben	i think the `=` operator is actually called the matching operator
2018-12-03 07:54:07	~ben	not assignment or anything like that
2018-12-03 07:54:20	slipyx	i just brute forced it in python
2018-12-03 07:54:33	npa	oh, elixir is in erlang
2018-12-03 07:54:34	~ben	that's no fun
2018-12-03 07:54:36	~ben	i want to suffer
2018-12-03 07:54:41	~ben	yeah elixir compiles for the erlang vm
2018-12-03 07:54:52	dokuja	yeah

2018-12-03 07:56:02	npa	oh it uses atoms too
2018-12-03 07:56:10	dokuja	prolog?
2018-12-03 07:56:16	npa	nah, elixir
2018-12-03 07:56:26	npa	like, yeah prolog uses atoms, but they're not erlang atoms
2018-12-03 07:56:39	npa	they're instances of relations in a rule body
2018-12-03 07:56:42	~ben	elixir has a lot of syntax niceties that you might see in ruby
2018-12-03 07:56:48	~ben	and also a lot of erlang stuff
2018-12-03 07:56:54	dokuja	ah.

2018-12-03 12:47:52	severak	the question is - when it's morning in tildeverse
2018-12-03 12:49:51	cdmnky	well, since we use UTC for the radio, 0700 UTC?
2018-12-03 12:50:19	cdmnky	granted ben is in EST, so it'd be more like 1200UTC in that case
2018-12-03 12:55:33	npa	TWELVE HUNDRED EWE TEE SEE
2018-12-03 12:55:48	npa	idk why i picked EWE instead of YOU
2018-12-03 12:56:53	cdmnky	when anonradio uses a japanese voice so it says "za taimu uiru bii juu-nii ouaasu ando zero minitsu"
2018-12-03 12:57:16	slipyx	female?
2018-12-03 12:57:21	cdmnky	yup
2018-12-03 13:04:44	cdmnky	I can't wait, my ifixit kit's gonna be here tomorrow
2018-12-03 13:05:13	cdmnky	granted I only needed it to replace some screws on my laptop, but it's still pretty exciting
2018-12-03 13:05:36	cdmnky	I might teardown my old broken iphone to see if there's more than just dead pixels wrong with it

2018-12-03 13:07:56	cdmnky	:)
2018-12-03 13:07:58	%ubergeek	You might find out it's not dead pixels, but an unseated ribbon cable
2018-12-03 13:08:18	%ubergeek	Thoses ZIF ribbon cables don't stay seated very well for some reason
2018-12-03 13:08:47	cdmnky	ubergeek: nah, it's definitely dead pixels. they're towards the top edge of the screen in a way which looks like moisture leeched in from the part of the chassis that kept coming unseated
2018-12-03 13:09:19	cdmnky	my iphone 5c was one of the ones who's chassis were coming off after a couple years, and why I upgraded on cycle
2018-12-03 13:10:39	cdmnky	i'm definitely getting a moto g in february, now that motorola is selling replacement parts for all their models from the past three years

2018-12-03 13:42:44	cdmnky	CS is a much better field to study in than what my dad did (computer engineering). he can't find much work, but a general CS degree keeps your options more open
2018-12-03 13:42:48	mushmouth	ce

2018-12-03 14:55:40	~ben	cdmnky: is dark green
2018-12-03 14:55:56	+jan6	slef nic only affects your end, which is nice if you don't like white, or stuff

2018-12-03 15:09:57	cdmnky	my high school math teacher said that all the time
2018-12-03 15:10:49	cdmnky	he was great, he had enough PTO to retire halfway through last year but didn't because they didn't have anyone else that could teach us calculus as well
2018-12-03 15:11:04	cdmnky	although, he did call in sick on every staff development day lol

2018-12-03 15:27:40	mushmouth	i was thinking of adding 16gb
2018-12-03 15:27:44	mushmouth	if i can find it for cheap
2018-12-03 15:28:03	cdmnky	by iced coffee, i meant the cold brew stuff that has no cream or sugar in it that the library cafe sells
2018-12-03 15:28:08	+jan6	cdmnky: both? both, both is good!
2018-12-03 15:29:12	mushmouth	and then maybe adding a bigger ssd if i can

2018-12-03 15:30:42	+jan6	lol
2018-12-03 15:30:47	mushmouth	so obviously take the free ram?

2018-12-03 15:32:33	mushmouth	i mean ext is pretty old and dated
2018-12-03 15:32:48	cdmnky	I'd run LTS instead, but it breaks compton with my nvidia card
2018-12-03 15:33:22	cdmnky	I don't really do any fancy partitioning anyway, so I never saw a need to use anything other than ext4
2018-12-03 15:34:24	mushmouth	zfs i believe it's called? is pretty nice but i don't believe there like an office port or anything
2018-12-03 15:34:32	mushmouth	offical*
2018-12-03 15:35:31	~ben	i use ext4 pretty much everywhere
2018-12-03 15:35:58	cdmnky	zfs is owned by oracle iirc
2018-12-03 15:36:00	~ben	i'll have to keep an eye out for that once 4.19 hits debian sid

2018-12-03 15:40:52	+jan6	well, probably not more
2018-12-03 15:41:26	+jan6	there are zfs and reiserfs and ext2 and 3 and way more
2018-12-03 15:42:09	mushmouth	isn't zfs freebsd not oracle?
2018-12-03 15:43:19	~ben	could be

2018-12-03 15:47:25	+jan6	^cause why not, right?
2018-12-03 15:47:31	cdmnky	ext2 is just ext4 without journaling. only time I've ever used that was for the 2MB BIOS partition on BIOS machines
2018-12-03 15:47:42	+jan6	shat about ext3 tho?
2018-12-03 15:48:01	cdmnky	idk about that, I thought it was just ext4 but older
2018-12-03 15:48:32	cdmnky	btrfs is good for snapshots, backups and RAIDs on like servers and stuff iirc

2018-12-03 15:50:47	cdmnky	at least we can all agree that vfat and ntfs partitions are dumb for linux rootfses
2018-12-03 15:51:08	%ubergeek	I did an ntfs root partition...  Just for funsies.
2018-12-03 15:51:09	+jan6	why so?
2018-12-03 15:51:14	%ubergeek	Spoiler alert:  It wasn't fun.
2018-12-03 15:51:26	cdmnky	disk fragmentation

2018-12-03 15:55:06	cdmnky	when we're adults yet helicopter parents invade the universities now too
2018-12-03 15:55:28	mushmouth	when i see people outside with pjs it doesn't bother me

2018-12-03 15:55:58	+jan6	sure
2018-12-03 15:56:07	mushmouth	cdmnky: yeah that what im saying though
2018-12-03 15:56:10	+jan6	as long as it doesn't look too out of place, it's ok
2018-12-03 15:56:13	mushmouth	like she not in boxers or such

2018-12-03 16:09:20	~ben	preservation of angular momentum
2018-12-03 16:09:42	cdmnky	you change direction of the one object, the whole system starts rotating to compensate i guess

2018-12-03 16:17:03	login	i can believe conservation of linear momentum in the absence of an external force on the system...
2018-12-03 16:17:18	login	but how to get from there towards conservation of angular momentum in the absence of an external torque...
2018-12-03 16:17:53	login	^ this works for point objects and rigid bodies only... deformations will mean angular momentum is not conserved (i think this is true, from what i remember, but i can't prove it, although i would like to)

2018-12-03 17:21:18	cdmnky	grilled chicken btw
2018-12-03 17:23:33	+aewens	I was usually a fan of getting buffalo chicken wraps for lunch when I was college. My friend and I befriended the chef there and he'd make us off-menu ideas he was working on, good times.
2018-12-03 17:24:24	cdmnky	yeah, there isn't any friendliness here. it's "get things cooked, paid for and eaten as fast as possible"
2018-12-03 17:24:55	cdmnky	half the time I don't get a chance to tell them which account to pay from, and they always try to take my debit card when I show them I want to swipe it

2018-12-03 17:30:21	cdmnky	nah, she said that jokingly

2018-12-03 17:30:55	cdmnky	she made a joke about eastern europeans and I said "aren't you one" and she was like "I'm central european"

2018-12-03 17:36:32	cdmnky	yeah. makes you wonder how big countries can exist
2018-12-03 17:38:34	+jan6	it's simple
2018-12-03 17:38:45	+jan6	they are different worlds
2018-12-03 17:39:26	+jan6	cultural differences, and kinda-forced stuff
2018-12-03 17:39:27	+aewens	Well, larger countries tend to have a concept of states/provinces that act as "mini countries".
2018-12-03 17:39:35	+jan6	^that too
2018-12-03 17:40:33	+aewens	Like, if you imagine Europe as being one big country with a bunch of provinces led under the EU you get something *similar* to how America works (with many much hand waving to make the analogy work)
2018-12-03 17:40:34	+jan6	they aren't REALLY big countries, they're more of "collection of subareas that haven't dared to leave the union"
2018-12-03 17:42:05	+aewens	That and smaller countries tend to be more "dense" than larger countries. For instance, America is huge compared to Europe, but a lot of America is wide open land without people roaming about it.
2018-12-03 17:50:33	+jan6	same for russia
2018-12-03 17:51:17	+jan6	huge land, but mostly just void of humans, or at least very sparsely populated

2018-12-03 18:56:11	~ben	just use syncthing

2018-12-03 19:27:34	+aewens	With current NSFW detection powers, exactly how are they hoping to definitively enforce this at their scale?

2018-12-03 19:41:26	~ben	you have to donate to get the invite code

2018-12-03 19:41:39	~ben	discord is a closed platform
2018-12-03 19:41:55	%ubergeek	About the only way to get a feature in you want, that he doesn't it to out and out fork
2018-12-03 19:42:08	khuxkm|lounge	so you have to donate to get the invite code to masto upstream dev? that sucks

2018-12-03 19:44:58	+aewens	I feel it would be more impressive if we faked the moon landing than landing on the moon during the time it would have needed to be faked.
2018-12-03 19:45:12	~ben	lol true that
2018-12-03 19:47:51	+aewens	Can we talk about how Wordpress thinks it's appropriate to greet me with "Howdy"? Because it's kind of off putting.
2018-12-03 19:48:50	sebboh	I don't think it's appropriate for Google Maps to say "Welcome to Iowa" when I cross the border.  They only several football-fields of Iowa, not the whole thing...
2018-12-03 19:49:10	sebboh	s/y o/y own o/
2018-12-03 19:49:10	sedbot	<sebboh> I don't think it's appropriate for Google Maps to say "Welcome to Iowa" when I cross the border.  They own only several football-fields of Iowa, not the whole thing...
2018-12-03 19:49:21	+aewens	Plus, they usually do it before I see the sign.
2018-12-03 19:49:58	+aewens	Those giant, cannot miss signs on the road.
2018-12-03 19:50:25	+aewens	Yes Google Maps, I know I'm in a new state. The traffic signs all drivers should be aware of alerted me to this.
2018-12-03 19:53:36	rdh	You don't always get those signs though
2018-12-03 19:53:54	rdh	Then again, if anyone could figure out if you're on the interstate or a backroad, it should be google
2018-12-03 19:54:02	sebboh	I don't mine the audio.  It's the content.  It should say "The good people of Iowa welcome you, probably" or "May I be so bold as to welcome you to Iowa on behalf of Iowans?" or something like that.
2018-12-03 19:54:21	rdh	If I lived in Iowa I wouldn't want Google speaking fo rme
2018-12-03 19:54:29	sebboh	^
2018-12-03 19:54:53	sebboh	I don't think they can even speak for california.

2018-12-03 20:02:17	-->	stompy (peachfuzz@ip68-13-254-74.ok.ok.cox.net) has joined #meta
2018-12-03 20:03:28	~ben	it seemed completely normal to me
2018-12-03 20:05:54	+aewens	Also, Google Maps feels it's okay to say "Make a right turn" when I'm near a right turn, followed by "in X hundred feet".
2018-12-03 20:06:39	+aewens	Firstly, the proximity to a right turn along with an instruction to turn right makes me feel the turn I'm next to is the correct one.
2018-12-03 20:07:12	+aewens	Secondly, who has any concept of how far away 800 feet is? That measurement means nothing to me.
2018-12-03 20:07:42	~ben	you don't have a sense of that?
2018-12-03 20:08:25	~ben	i've kinda developed a natural understanding of it from using GPSs
2018-12-03 20:08:47	+aewens	I know how much a foot is, I know how much a yard is, I have never realy placed down multiple rulers to get an idea how far 800 of them are from me.
2018-12-03 20:09:21	rdh	Well I think "in 800 feet" is obvious enough, even if you don't really know what 800 feet is.
2018-12-03 20:09:21	+aewens	Especially when I'm moving around 20mph
2018-12-03 20:09:40	rdh	It's most likely the next interesection but pretty obviously not hte one you're currently at
2018-12-03 20:09:43	~ben	aewens: a football field is 300 feet
2018-12-03 20:09:49	rdh	Hopefully you at least know THAT's closer than 800 feet
2018-12-03 20:10:01	~ben	yeah that too

2018-12-03 20:11:40	+aewens	Oh, neat
2018-12-03 20:12:10	+aewens	So 800 feet is ~3 soccer fields away?
2018-12-03 20:12:25	~ben	close enough yeah
2018-12-03 20:13:25	+aewens	Also, is it just me or is it really laggy all of a sudden?

2018-12-03 20:31:30	+aewens	arne: sr.ht is open sourced, so you can already if you wanted to use it's codebase
2018-12-03 20:31:32	+aewens	khuxkm|lounge: Open source doesn't pay for itself
2018-12-03 20:31:34	+aewens	Freedom comes at a cost
2018-12-03 20:31:39	arne	i know
2018-12-03 20:31:40	amcclure	hello
2018-12-03 20:31:42	+aewens	I cannot re-join after jan6 kicked me
2018-12-03 20:31:45	arne	im looking at its source code rn
2018-12-03 20:31:48	+aewens	I used to not like it for that reason. Then I liked it for that reason.
2018-12-03 20:31:56	+aewens	Also, the community projects in the Python community is *huge*
2018-12-03 20:31:58	+jan6	lol
2018-12-03 20:32:00	+aewens	However, I'm right now shopping around for a low-level language to go with for faster programming.
2018-12-03 20:32:01	arne	i think jan banned u
2018-12-03 20:32:02	+aewens	Where faster is read as runs faster, not codes faster.
2018-12-03 20:32:04	+aewens	So I have C/lua, C++, or Rust as the candidates.
2018-12-03 20:32:06	arne	not kicked
2018-12-03 20:32:10	+jan6	"communist projects in python"
2018-12-03 20:32:14	+jan6	kicked
2018-12-03 20:32:14	amcclure	aewens: kicked from what
2018-12-03 20:32:14	arne	communi
2018-12-03 20:32:15	arne	ti
2018-12-03 20:32:31	+jan6	it's just borked

2018-12-03 20:32:49	arne	for respect
2018-12-03 20:32:49	amcclure	i dont go onto #chaos

2018-12-03 20:33:20	arne	k bye
2018-12-03 20:33:21	+aewens	Hmm, you do you
2018-12-03 20:33:56	+jan6	I AM the chaos
2018-12-03 20:34:12	rgdrake	aewens: Rust is a very good choice
2018-12-03 20:34:14	+aewens	No, you do chaos, I AM the chaos.
2018-12-03 20:34:32	+jan6	I am the chaos, you do the chaos
2018-12-03 20:34:36	+aewens	rgdrake: Any reason? I'm on the fence, all I need is a good push.
2018-12-03 20:34:47	amcclure	anyone here on blinkenshell? lol
2018-12-03 20:34:51	+jan6	rust should rust to death
2018-12-03 20:34:59	rgdrake	Fewer if any memory leaks
2018-12-03 20:35:01	~ben	drew said he'd make exceptions for people with financial reasons
2018-12-03 20:35:03	~ben	and would also trade sr.ht access for patches
2018-12-03 20:35:15	~ben	the guy in the lead is using ruby
2018-12-03 20:35:17	~ben	for aoc?
2018-12-03 20:35:19	~ben	oh you're talking about sr.ht
2018-12-03 20:35:21	~ben	so?
2018-12-03 20:35:22	khuxkm|lounge	I prefer Python, Lua, Java, C (in that order)
2018-12-03 20:35:23	~ben	why not
2018-12-03 20:35:25	~ben	try rust
2018-12-03 20:35:27	~ben	if u want a low level language
2018-12-03 20:35:35	~ben	jan6: what's wrong with rust
2018-12-03 20:35:40	+jan6	everything
2018-12-03 20:35:45	+jan6	including all the Cargo
2018-12-03 20:35:54	~ben	wow what a helpful statement
2018-12-03 20:36:07	+aewens	ben: I'm talking about whether to invest in learning C, C++, or Rust for low-level in a general sense.
2018-12-03 20:36:14	+jan6	assembly
2018-12-03 20:36:26	+jan6	tbh, regular C is pretty cool
2018-12-03 20:36:27	rgdrake	Rust is (C++)++
2018-12-03 20:36:35	~ben	aewens: depends on the usecase
2018-12-03 20:36:41	+jan6	soo, C-made-worse-made worse? kay
2018-12-03 20:36:48	rgdrake	no
2018-12-03 20:36:49	TildeBot	no u infinity rgdrake
2018-12-03 20:37:05	+jan6	c++ is c made worse, and more powerful
2018-12-03 20:37:31	rgdrake	Rust is C++ improved
2018-12-03 20:38:02	+jan6	and c++ is C demproved
2018-12-03 20:38:06	amcclure	how
2018-12-03 20:38:07	khuxkm|lounge	assembly is the best
2018-12-03 20:38:10	+jan6	^
2018-12-03 20:38:16	+jan6	that, if you have the time
2018-12-03 20:38:16	khuxkm|lounge	especially on small systems like the GameBoy
2018-12-03 20:38:23	rgdrake	too low level
2018-12-03 20:38:26	~ben	there's a reason that we don't write assembly anymore
2018-12-03 20:38:26	rgdrake	imho
2018-12-03 20:38:34	+jan6	assembly is good if you have enogh time to deal with it
2018-12-03 20:38:42	kirch	haha, chaos is chaotic
2018-12-03 20:38:43	~ben	most people don't
2018-12-03 20:38:44	kirch	#chaos is flooding me with flooding messages
2018-12-03 20:38:47	+jan6	C is python of compiled languages

2018-12-03 20:38:52	khuxkm|lounge	I wouldn't suggest using assembly on modern computers (too much shit in x86) but for old computers? assembly is best, hands down
2018-12-03 20:38:52	kirch	amcclure: how many vouches you need?
2018-12-03 20:38:54	+jan6	lol
2018-12-03 20:38:54	kirch	amcclure: if you can give me something to put in the vouch comments other than "nice, knowledgeable" or "nice, just here to learn" and I'll give you a blinkenvouch right now
2018-12-03 20:38:57	amcclure	2 lol
2018-12-03 20:38:57	khuxkm|lounge	C wasn't built for those
2018-12-03 20:39:09	+jan6	khuxkm|lounge: why not on modern ones?
2018-12-03 20:39:19	+jan6	you can always use a subset
2018-12-03 20:39:22	khuxkm|lounge	because x86 is a monstrosity that needs to be flung into the sun
2018-12-03 20:39:22	amcclure	o
2018-12-03 20:39:36	rgdrake	what are the vouches for?
2018-12-03 20:40:04	amcclure	blinkenshell requires vouches for new signups
2018-12-03 20:40:15	rgdrake	oh ok, blinkenshell
2018-12-03 20:41:48	 *	amcclure thinks about what kirch should write for vouch comments
2018-12-03 20:43:15	kirch	I never know what to say XD
2018-12-03 20:43:21	amcclure	same lol
2018-12-03 20:45:18	+jan6	^+-2
2018-12-03 20:45:33	amcclure	all I can really think of has to do with thunix and/or my own servers
2018-12-03 20:48:11	+aewens	I think what I'll do is try to create a program in C/C+Lua and Rust and see which one I enjoy using more and go that way.
2018-12-03 20:49:52	~ben	that's fair
2018-12-03 20:49:57	+aewens	Which will probably be my usual program I use to test out / figure out a language: writing a simple key/value store and API for using it.
2018-12-03 20:50:20	amcclure	idrk what to say
2018-12-03 20:50:51	+aewens	What about what you just said?
2018-12-03 20:51:16	+jan6	lua is kewl, it's small and kinda minimal, but you just make your own stuff as you need it (or copypaste)
2018-12-03 20:51:25	+jan6	everything = tables
2018-12-03 20:51:55	kirch	yeah - lua's neat - the syntax is a lil' weird but a quick googlin' fixes it
2018-12-03 20:51:57	khuxkm|lounge	plus, you can use Lua with anything :P
2018-12-03 20:52:05	~ben	elixir++
2018-12-03 20:52:10	khuxkm|lounge	Python, Java, Lua itself
2018-12-03 20:52:15	kirch	I had a lua thingy on my Nintendo DS & never figured it out
2018-12-03 20:52:16	+jan6	oh, lua starts counting at 1 instead of 0, is worth mentioning
2018-12-03 20:52:33	+jan6	lua is yeah, tiny AND everywhere
2018-12-03 20:52:33	kirch	then recently I got my kid on minetest & had to hack a bit of lua to help him out
2018-12-03 20:52:43	+jan6	minetest mods are duper ez
2018-12-03 20:52:51	+jan6	as long as it's just blocks ;P

2018-12-03 21:11:57	 *	jan6 wonders about possibilities of mixing different adapters, so like, if you have mobile net and wifi, you can use both at once, for faster net
2018-12-03 21:12:06	+jan6	would be awesome
2018-12-03 21:12:27	mushmouth	huh?
2018-12-03 21:12:53	+aewens	jan6: You just described Google's Project Fi
2018-12-03 21:13:10	+aewens	At least at a throughput point of view
2018-12-03 21:13:23	+jan6	what about 2 ethernet connections tho?
2018-12-03 21:13:58	+aewens	Sure, that's something all my customers use for their supercomputers. One interface for in, another interface for out.
2018-12-03 21:14:11	+jan6	not in that way
2018-12-03 21:14:47	+jan6	I mean, one plugged into home network, other into work, kinda deal, both are two-directional
2018-12-03 21:14:49	+aewens	Is it though? Because if you are reading/writing data over a network, you are dividing up bandwidth one way or another.
2018-12-03 21:15:25	+jan6	what I mean is use all your connections to boost everything
2018-12-03 21:15:38	+aewens	Sure, other people do that too. Most of our clusters have 3 networks: Management, InfiniBand, and IPMI.
2018-12-03 21:16:19	+aewens	Management for communicating with the nodes, InfiniBand for reading/writing quickly, and IPMI for remote access/control.
2018-12-03 21:16:28	+jan6	so you can use wifi + ethernet + bluetooth internet all at once to get faster speed, while all of them could very well be totally different service providers
2018-12-03 21:16:43	~ben	that sounds like a lot of race conditions
2018-12-03 21:16:47	+aewens	^
2018-12-03 21:16:50	+jan6	software
2018-12-03 21:17:14	~ben	without deciding how to delegate the packets beforehand it's going to make everything slower
2018-12-03 21:17:38	+jan6	the computer can probably divide stuff up faster than the interfaces send, if you optimize it wel enough
2018-12-03 21:18:03	amcclure	kirch: anything specific?
2018-12-03 21:18:15	+aewens	For web browsing, you could employ a system to fetch a document and then dispatch the resource files to the other interfaces, but then you may have a website bottlenecking on the Wi-Fi to get the video when the other interfaces got everything else.
2018-12-03 21:18:21	+jan6	but eh, I guess it calls for a new protocol and stuff
2018-12-03 21:19:00	+aewens	Yeah, most network activity does not inform you ahead of time how many documents are needed to be pulled, it's usually done asynchronously as needed
2018-12-03 21:19:03	kirch	amcclure: I'll just make something up

2018-12-03 22:15:34	login	You wanted a program that interprets tcoin messages and spits amounts out right?
2018-12-03 22:15:59	login	The one i wrote in awk takes "tcoin -m" as input, and can spit out amounts, senders, and receivers
2018-12-03 22:16:05	sebboh	and quietly let most users use it on other people.. so when random user gets drunk and starts playing with the bot.. we can just make it ignore them. ;)
2018-12-03 22:16:10	+jan6	sebboh: nah, that only for the bot admin, else I could put it to ignore the whole channel
2018-12-03 22:16:13	login	It doesn't handle messages yet, but I can put that in after some time...
2018-12-03 22:16:42	sebboh	a privmsg is just a channel message to a nickname instead of a channel. :)

2018-12-03 22:17:28	sebboh	"trucking game" is a phrase that doesn't make much sense to me.  ...Though I guess "programming game" wouldn't make sense to some other people...
2018-12-03 22:17:31	+jan6	I of course assumed not ~town, cause not ~town irc

2018-12-03 22:19:25	sebboh	(I guess ~user expansion doesn't work like that.)

2018-12-03 22:19:36	sebboh	(so, /home/ ...)
2018-12-03 22:19:43	sebboh	mushmouth: I see.
2018-12-03 22:20:38	+jan6	just add `sed 's./home/.~.'` at the end of pwd or ls or stuff to convert /home into ~syntax
2018-12-03 22:21:37	mushmouth	$home is the other one isn't it?
2018-12-03 22:21:46	mushmouth	can't remember exact line
2018-12-03 22:25:02	+jan6	$HOME only works for you
2018-12-03 22:25:56	+jan6	mine just replaces /home/ with ~ so it works for anybody who's on the same system

2018-12-03 22:34:25	login	wget is not copyleft, is that why?
2018-12-03 22:34:40	mushmouth	wget is copyleft. curl is non copyleft
2018-12-03 22:34:47	mushmouth	you had it confused
2018-12-03 22:34:59	~khuxkm	why does bsd not have wget?
2018-12-03 22:35:08	~khuxkm	why not just make a BSD wget
2018-12-03 22:35:08	mushmouth	khuxkm: because it copyleft
2018-12-03 22:35:15	mushmouth	gpl license
2018-12-03 22:35:19	~khuxkm	why does copyleft make it a no-go for bsd?

2018-12-03 22:42:32	mushmouth	uh im sure you can with some user agents
2018-12-03 22:42:46	mushmouth	curl to be fair i find better then wget

2018-12-03 22:52:07	+jan6	I personally think you should explictly grant the licence to organisations, and then they can use it

2018-12-03 23:57:30	mushmouth	like ben said it has bad annoitation no matter how you describe it
2018-12-03 23:59:49	npa	what about code tinkerer
2018-12-04 00:00:06	mushmouth	npa: yeah that better
2018-12-04 00:00:12	mushmouth	or unix nerd
2018-12-04 00:00:16	mushmouth	or something else
2018-12-04 00:00:24	mushmouth	geek would be better
2018-12-04 00:01:07	npa	but hack really has that glueing shit together vibe
2018-12-04 00:01:58	mushmouth	npa: it makes sense to us but not to the people around us
2018-12-04 00:03:25	mushmouth	if your goal is to try and describe it to someone who 60+ who not richard stallman good luck
2018-12-04 00:10:24	giacomo	mushmouth: this is not a license for the present, it's a license for the future
2018-12-04 00:10:35	giacomo	I want to turn everybody to a hacker
2018-12-04 00:10:51	giacomo	and this license is a tool for this goal
2018-12-04 00:11:27	giacomo	I've also slighly changed the preamble in this version
2018-12-04 00:11:42	giacomo	Our Curiosity serves Humanity through Freedom, Candor and Communion.
2018-12-04 00:11:44	giacomo	This license grants you the right to hack with us, to explore ways we
2018-12-04 00:11:46	giacomo	ignore and to challenge our assumptions by teaching us what you will learn.

2018-12-04 00:37:54	ahriman	neocities is nifty for free static sites
2018-12-04 00:38:44	hyperboredoubt	Agreed.
2018-12-04 00:40:12	ahriman	though for $5/mo for their paid plan you can run a VPS
2018-12-04 00:41:48	giacomo	published the new version http://www.tesio.it/documents/HACK.txt
2018-12-04 00:43:07	hyperboredoubt	What is a VPS?
2018-12-04 00:44:33	giacomo	Virtual Private Server

2018-12-04 00:47:57	cognifice	What is a virtual private server and why would someone want one?
2018-12-04 00:48:37	giacomo	it's a virtual machine on a stranger server
2018-12-04 00:48:57	giacomo	it's cheaper than a phisical machine
2018-12-04 00:49:10	cognifice	Interesting.
2018-12-04 00:49:17	xvetrd	its like a tilde, but for one person. sort of
2018-12-04 00:50:00	giacomo	you can install what you want (in theory, I don't have one and I didn't read any contract)
2018-12-04 00:50:09	npa	yeah like a linux server you can run stuff from
2018-12-04 00:50:28	giacomo	but you usually have to chose an operating system among the one provided
2018-12-04 00:50:35	xvetrd	you're the sysadmin. you can do what you want
2018-12-04 00:50:38	giacomo	s/one/ones/
2018-12-04 00:50:38	sedbot	<giacomo> but you usually have to chose an operating system among the ones provided
2018-12-04 00:50:44	npa	yeah, but they offer everything sane giacomo 
2018-12-04 00:50:51	npa	(usually)
2018-12-04 00:51:03	giacomo	npa: I'm insane :-D
2018-12-04 00:51:44	npa	i think hetzner even allows you to run images they don't provide but they won't give you support
2018-12-04 00:52:25	xvetrd	vultr does a similar thing. you can upload an ISO and it gets installed or at least mounted
2018-12-04 00:52:50	xvetrd	i think. i almost got a vps but then i got a tilde, and it covers my needs
2018-12-04 00:58:23	hyperboredoubt	I put my computer on night-light mode and now I am sleepy from the orange glow, lol.
2018-12-04 00:58:47	cognifice	I can't tell if it is the placebo effect or if it actually works.
2018-12-04 01:02:22	%ubergeek	4 chan lost its appeal once they stopped doing things for lulz, and instead got PAd by MAGAts
2018-12-04 01:02:38	%ubergeek	strike that, way late in the convo...  forgot to pg dn
2018-12-04 01:04:03	xvetrd	i mean, i stopped going to /b/ maybe round 2012, and stopped browsing /mu/ and /g/ in 2015? i think
2018-12-04 01:04:17	%ubergeek	yeah, about the same time for me
2018-12-04 01:04:33	%ubergeek	except, 2012 was my drop date, thereabouts
2018-12-04 01:04:53	xvetrd	what a strange time
2018-12-04 01:05:17	%ubergeek	Yeah, not going to lie, had fun during Chanology, and 888, but afterwards, I guess I grew up?
2018-12-04 01:05:46	%ubergeek	After a certain age, I guess being shocking doesn't hold the same appeal :P
2018-12-04 01:06:42	xvetrd	yeah there was this realization that no, things are actually serious and need to be looked at as such
2018-12-04 01:06:49	%ubergeek	that too
2018-12-04 01:06:58	xvetrd	4chan is very, VERY cynical
2018-12-04 01:07:08	xvetrd	or was
2018-12-04 01:14:25	~deepend	jan6: "+jan6 | it's eggdrop, so basically it's black sorcery nobody sane uses"   haha yeah.. i should probably question my own sanity..
2018-12-04 01:15:14	hyperboredoubt	What is eggdrop?
2018-12-04 01:17:00	~deepend	its an irc bot
2018-12-04 01:17:06	~deepend	TildeBot is a eggdrop bot
2018-12-04 01:17:08	TildeBot	deepend: I have a fedi bot that toots everytime someone mentions tildebot. Aewens is a eggdrop bot, no news there.
2018-12-04 01:18:52	amcclure	hey tildeverse
2018-12-04 01:18:54	hyperboredoubt	What does eggdrop do?
2018-12-04 01:19:00	hyperboredoubt	Hi, amcclure.
2018-12-04 01:19:01	~deepend	apparently it seems i'm the only one crazy enough to run an eggdrop bot 
2018-12-04 01:19:06	~deepend	hi amcclure 
2018-12-04 01:19:18	amcclure	eggdrop?
2018-12-04 01:19:24	~deepend	eggdrop bot does whatever its scripted to do.. 
2018-12-04 01:19:30	amcclure	I used to run one on thunix lol
2018-12-04 01:19:41	~deepend	is my bot of choice..

2018-12-04 01:20:00	TildeBot	Eggheads 
2018-12-04 01:20:00	amcclure	I liked it
2018-12-04 01:20:46	amcclure	I wonder if I backed it up though since I made a dedicated user for bots and scripts
2018-12-04 01:21:21	amcclure	remember when I connected to tildeverse with a user called "archvsync"?
2018-12-04 01:22:09	%ubergeek	Eggdrop isn't bad.  It's just tcl script
2018-12-04 01:22:37	%ubergeek	I'm out of practice, but I wrote some pretty kick ass bot code
2018-12-04 01:43:29	hyperboredoubt	<bump_fish<

2018-12-04 01:57:15	hyperboredoubt	What is grex?
2018-12-04 01:57:39	~tomasino	it's a pubnix

2018-12-04 02:00:01	~tomasino	nice!
2018-12-04 02:00:13	~tomasino	i signed up once, but they had such aggressive dotfiles it skeeved me out
2018-12-04 02:00:16	~tomasino	and i bailed
2018-12-04 02:00:19	~tomasino	:(
2018-12-04 02:00:31	%ubergeek	It's so much easier when you curl https://hashbang.sh | sudo bash -
2018-12-04 02:00:31	TildeBot	&lrm; 
2018-12-04 02:00:36	%ubergeek	No problems at all :)
2018-12-04 02:00:36	TildeBot	no u infinity ubergeek
2018-12-04 02:00:56	%ubergeek	Oh hashbang?  I have to admit, I'm a little lost still on it
2018-12-04 02:01:22	~tomasino	i've got my stuff so customized it feels dirty using someone else's tricked out shell
2018-12-04 02:01:42	%ubergeek	ah, yeah, that *may* be why I feel a bit lost/overwhelmed
2018-12-04 02:02:02	%ubergeek	I prefer starting with a bare shell, and working from there, since all of my shells pretty much keep the same configs now
2018-12-04 02:02:29	%ubergeek	(Although, it's not much, a .profile, a .bashrc, .bash_aliased, and a .vimrc)
2018-12-04 02:06:18	hyperboredoubt	Someone should make a skeleton themed tilde/gopher site called bone.zone.
2018-12-04 02:10:41	 *	ubergeek realizes there is not wiki page in the tildeverse on how to do basic git stuff
2018-12-04 02:12:53	npa	the golden rule of git - if you mess up, delete the folder and clone again
2018-12-04 02:12:58	npa	lol
2018-12-04 02:15:27	%ubergeek	git reset --HARD :)

2018-12-04 02:18:05	cognifice	It would be super goth, lol.
2018-12-04 02:18:51	xvetrd	we have differnt ideas of what skeles are like
2018-12-04 02:19:05	hyperboredoubt	Explain.
2018-12-04 02:20:02	xvetrd	skellys are def a bunch of goofs. like, they just wanna be cool and everyone is like "ew no get away from me i don't want to acknowledge my own mortality and deal with the existential crisis that is death"
2018-12-04 02:20:15	xvetrd	and skellys are like "nah mah, jazz music"
2018-12-04 02:20:41	cognifice	Or maybe ghost.town.

2018-12-04 06:18:11	~ben	node ^^

2018-12-04 06:26:52	npa	anything you need OOP for, you probably should write in those anyway

2018-12-04 06:27:39	npa	@ what fosslinux?
2018-12-04 06:27:50	fosslinux	npa: what do you mean
2018-12-04 06:30:02	npa	i've never enjoyed writing large programs in python, and python itself becomes the bottleneck after a while
2018-12-04 06:30:16	~ben	lots of strange things in py
2018-12-04 06:30:31	npa	you will likely never get to that point on your own fosslinux, these are mega projects
2018-12-04 06:31:59	fosslinux	ok i need some help then
2018-12-04 06:32:18	npa	having no static typing starts becoming more a hindrance than a helper as it gets larger
2018-12-04 06:32:49	npa	with what fosslinux ?
2018-12-04 06:33:08	fosslinux	POLL: what progarmming language should i learn next. this language should have usability for large projects, good oop support, and the lagnuage should be secure

2018-12-04 13:29:15	desvox	alc + stimulants is nice tho
2018-12-04 13:29:47	rgdrake	except for the alcohol poisoning
2018-12-04 13:30:01	desvox	yeah if you're a dipshit
2018-12-04 13:30:23	desvox	not ODing on alc isnt that hard
2018-12-04 13:30:28	rgdrake	that is all that makes the news, the dipshits
2018-12-04 13:31:06	desvox	actually i take that back ive made myself sick with too much to drink more than i can count
2018-12-04 13:31:24	desvox	ive only been dragged out of a public bathroom once tho
2018-12-04 13:31:41	 *	cdmnky has never had alc because of the rediculous US drinking age
2018-12-04 13:31:52	desvox	who the fuck waits until they're legal to drink?
2018-12-04 13:32:18	cdmnky	someone who's family hates alcohol and can't get it on their own lol
2018-12-04 13:32:32	rgdrake	I've only drank enough once to have a hangover, my 30th birthday, and I slept through it
2018-12-04 13:32:44	rgdrake	16 years ago
2018-12-04 13:32:47	desvox	oof
2018-12-04 13:32:51	cdmnky	besides, all I need is a passport and money for a hotel, or a DD. Montreal is only a couple hours away
2018-12-04 13:32:54	desvox	cdmnky: yeah thatll do it
2018-12-04 13:33:15	rgdrake	DD?
2018-12-04 13:33:23	cdmnky	although at that point I'd need a car
2018-12-04 13:33:29	cdmnky	rgdrake: designated driver
2018-12-04 13:33:33	rgdrake	oh ok
2018-12-04 13:33:34	desvox	im guess you're like 19ish or something?
2018-12-04 13:33:39	cdmnky	18
2018-12-04 13:33:41	desvox	cool
2018-12-04 13:33:55	desvox	i turned 21 almost a year ago and not needing a lackey is nice
2018-12-04 13:33:56	rgdrake	you only need the passport to get back home
2018-12-04 13:34:16	desvox	i dont have to pretend to other people to not be a dysfunctional alcoholic anymore
2018-12-04 13:34:20	desvox	which is nice
2018-12-04 13:34:35	cdmnky	not really. you need a passport to get where you're going. US law states no citizen can be denied reentry
2018-12-04 13:34:47	rgdrake	oh ok
2018-12-04 13:35:03	cdmnky	but border patrol would probably harrass you for a couple hours and find an excuse to arrest you lol
2018-12-04 13:35:09	rgdrake	but proving US citizenship
2018-12-04 13:35:15	cdmnky	"oh, you didn't declare the lettuce on this sandwich?"
2018-12-04 13:35:29	desvox	cdmnky: oof
2018-12-04 13:35:51	desvox	applying for social security income or food stamps is exactly like that tbh
2018-12-04 13:36:30	desvox	god i just love the guilty until proven innocent mentality of like, everyfuckingthing
2018-12-04 13:36:58	rgdrake	I managed to get on SSI before the Goverenment became real dicks about it
2018-12-04 13:37:27	desvox	ah thats good
2018-12-04 13:37:48	rgdrake	Helped that I was in a State of Missouri contractor mental health program
2018-12-04 13:38:00	desvox	i have a friend who had to fight getting on disability for at least a year, and in the meantime their partner started getting their checks garnished because unpaid medical expenses
2018-12-04 13:38:07	desvox	honestly what the fuck is wrong with healthcare
2018-12-04 13:38:29	rgdrake	exactly
2018-12-04 13:38:32	cdmnky	tfw you're wages get garnished anyway because social security and taxes
2018-12-04 13:38:57	cdmnky	why pay into a system that's doomed to fail by the time I get eligible for the benefits of it?
2018-12-04 13:39:02	desvox	i would love that if it didnt get blown on military expenses and other stupid bullshit
2018-12-04 13:39:27	 *	cdmnky lives in NY with the highest income tax percentage, in the county with the highest sales tax
2018-12-04 13:39:38	rgdrake	I Love America, it's the Government I'm not too sure of
2018-12-04 13:39:38	desvox	hey can we soak in the absolute fucking idiocy of this article https://thinkprogress.org/oklahoma-gop-county-chair-writes-letter-to-abolish-public-education-7d319c8b1e9c/

2018-12-04 13:39:45	cdmnky	it's a good thing the cost of living is really low where I live
2018-12-04 13:40:50	cdmnky	it's funny, when I went to canada for the first time, I thought 8% sales tax was bad...
2018-12-04 13:41:08	cdmnky	...then I ordered a $1 coffee and had to pay 15% tax on it
2018-12-04 13:50:07	+jan6	lol
2018-12-04 13:53:23	rgdrake	yawn

2018-12-04 16:49:47	cdmnky	yea, I added my weechat folder and my docs

2018-12-04 16:58:56	~ben	alt-u as well

2018-12-04 16:59:55	~ben	and go.py
2018-12-04 17:00:08	~ben	i don't really ever use alt-num
2018-12-04 17:00:23	~ben	maybe alt-1 if i need to get to the weechat buffer reql quick

2018-12-04 17:01:35	~ben	/buffer is 3 times longer than /go
2018-12-04 17:01:36	~ben	no thanks
2018-12-04 17:01:37	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-04 17:02:09	+jan6	I sure like to keep my main channels in the top 10 buffers, and switch those with alt-num
2018-12-04 17:02:51	~ben	you don't use autosort?
2018-12-04 17:02:58	~ben	it would be an absolute mess without autosort
2018-12-04 17:03:02	~ben	oof
2018-12-04 17:03:10	+jan6	what's mess
2018-12-04 17:03:30	+jan6	of COURSE I only use one server per weechat
2018-12-04 17:03:30	+aewens	I tried autosort, but I didn't like needing to constantly do /buffer move 2 for #meta every time
2018-12-04 17:03:45	+jan6	and of COURSE I disable the bufferlist and sort manually
2018-12-04 17:04:33	+jan6	#share is always 6, #bots always #3, main-channel-of-irc-is #2, and stuff
2018-12-04 17:04:47	~ben	why would yo umove the buffers
2018-12-04 17:04:56	+jan6	cause top 10
2018-12-04 17:05:01	+aewens	^
2018-12-04 17:05:02	~ben	alt-a
2018-12-04 17:05:07	+aewens	alt-no
2018-12-04 17:05:09	+jan6	alt switch is so much faster tho ;P
2018-12-04 17:05:16	~ben	no it's not
2018-12-04 17:05:17	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-04 17:05:20	+jan6	sure is
2018-12-04 17:05:34	+aewens	I am also too used to doing alt+2 for #meta
2018-12-04 17:05:35	+jan6	if it's valid for /buffer then it's valid for any command
2018-12-04 17:05:37	~ben	i don't like having anything out of order
2018-12-04 17:05:50	+jan6	exactly why I sort them to certain numbers
2018-12-04 17:05:56	+aewens	Sure, but my mental order requires #meta and #team in 2 and 3
2018-12-04 17:06:06	~ben	s/order/alphabetical %/
2018-12-04 17:06:07	sedbot	<ben> i don't like having anything out of alphabetical %
2018-12-04 17:06:10	+jan6	^#bots for 3 but yeah
2018-12-04 17:06:21	+jan6	heh you do you
2018-12-04 17:06:26	+aewens	Bots naturally goes to #6 for me, so it's fine
2018-12-04 17:06:39	+jan6	#share is 6
2018-12-04 17:06:39	~ben	too many channels to move shit around 
2018-12-04 17:06:43	~ben	no thanks
2018-12-04 17:06:44	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-04 17:06:45	+jan6	just top 10
2018-12-04 17:06:47	+jan6	lol
2018-12-04 17:06:53	+aewens	Yeah, just the top 5 for me
2018-12-04 17:06:55	~ben	plus the channel numbers all change if someone opens a query
2018-12-04 17:07:09	+jan6	nope
2018-12-04 17:07:12	+jan6	not the top 10
2018-12-04 17:07:34	+aewens	If I could tell autosort to do it's thing after setting my fav 5 where they belong, I'd use it
2018-12-04 17:07:34	+jan6	as said, you sort pretty much only top 10, others can be whatever
2018-12-04 17:07:43	~ben	you probably can

2018-12-04 17:26:38	+aewens	Ha, fixed it. Needed to uninstall, refresh, then re-install. That refresh part was the important bit
2018-12-04 17:27:24	kirch	I do not like autosort, much
2018-12-04 17:27:33	kirch	if I had a list, I guess I could see the value - but I do not

2018-12-04 17:41:18	+jan6	my weechat is always @ the laptop screen, idk how many lines really
2018-12-04 17:41:24	~ben	were you able to figure out the cert issue morsecodemedia ?
2018-12-04 17:41:53	+aewens	autosort did not last. Could not rtfm because the extensibility of autosort hinges on "<expression>" without any explanation of what that is or how to use it.
2018-12-04 17:41:58	~ben	if you want a remote shell that you can leave weechat running on, i'd recommend grabbing an account at tilde.team or yourtilde.com
2018-12-04 17:42:04	~ben	aewens: /help eval
2018-12-04 17:42:11	~ben	it mentions that at the top

2018-12-04 17:42:28	morsecodemedia	no, we just turned off verify. had actual work to get to. will probably set up one of my spare pis at home and just shell into that for weechat 
2018-12-04 17:42:41	~ben	lol that's fair
2018-12-04 17:42:46	+aewens	Hmm, I might come back to it later then
2018-12-04 17:43:02	~ben	imo weechat is best when you can leave it up and detach
2018-12-04 17:43:19	+jan6	morsecodemedia: why not run it on a tilde anyway?
2018-12-04 17:43:20	+aewens	Would also prefer if the autosort manual came with literally any documentation on the .weechat/autosort.conf file
2018-12-04 17:43:33	+jan6	"just read the code!"
2018-12-04 17:43:57	ahriman	morsecodemedia: look into a weechat SSL relay, like android-weechat. i've it set up and it's wonderful
2018-12-04 17:43:59	+aewens	The whole of weechat? nah
2018-12-04 17:44:12	+jan6	nah

2018-12-04 17:48:28	desvox	ben: does weechat-android have full backlog syncing, including being able to request more from the server?
2018-12-04 17:48:33	+jan6	good meme
2018-12-04 17:48:38	desvox	because quassel has this and it is so fucking comfy
2018-12-04 17:48:38	~ben	desvox: yeah
2018-12-04 17:48:41	desvox	cool
2018-12-04 17:48:43	rgdrake	pizza hut pizza for lunch on it's way
2018-12-04 17:49:05	+jan6	why'd you not use thelounge for mobile?
2018-12-04 17:49:10	~ben	i looked into that at one point but i couldn't get it to work
2018-12-04 17:49:23	~ben	cause weechat-android is like 100x better
2018-12-04 17:49:25	+jan6	how is it possible to NOT get it to work?
2018-12-04 17:49:32	~ben	it worked fine but it sucked
2018-12-04 17:49:41	+jan6	why so?
2018-12-04 17:49:49	+jan6	didn't have highmon? ;P
2018-12-04 17:49:50	~ben	it's a webapp
2018-12-04 17:49:59	+jan6	it's fine for CHATTING
2018-12-04 17:50:03	~ben	notifications were unreliable
2018-12-04 17:50:05	~ben	etc
2018-12-04 17:50:07	+jan6	not for me
2018-12-04 17:50:15	~ben	slow loading times
2018-12-04 17:50:41	+jan6	you just set it as an exception for "battery saver" and stuff, possibly priority notifications too
2018-12-04 17:50:58	+jan6	3 sec is not slow for me
2018-12-04 17:51:05	~ben	weechat-android is sub .5s
2018-12-04 17:51:18	~ben	it's a whole new world
2018-12-04 17:51:26	~ben	i recommend it whole-heartedly
2018-12-04 17:51:39	+jan6	though the "xrh poll failed" IS annoying, and no entry history too (which is weird, cause there IS history on desktop)
2018-12-04 17:51:58	~ben	no tab completion either, which weechat-android has
2018-12-04 17:51:59	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-04 17:52:32	+jan6	the sure is nick-completion
2018-12-04 17:52:39	+jan6	what else do you need to autocomplete?
2018-12-04 17:52:44	+jan6	command completion too
2018-12-04 17:53:04	~ben	ehh i'd rather use the tab button instead of prefixing @
2018-12-04 17:53:56	+jan6	I don't prefix
2018-12-04 17:54:26	~ben	thelounge does nick completion when you do @nick
2018-12-04 17:54:38	+jan6|	I just get ben by b<tab>
2018-12-04 17:54:56	~ben	there's a tab button?
2018-12-04 17:54:58	~ben	that must be new
2018-12-04 17:55:05	+jan6|	on my keyboard, only
2018-12-04 17:55:14	+jan6|	hacker's keyboard ftw
2018-12-04 17:55:31	+jan6|	bluetooth keyboards also have tab key usually

2018-12-04 18:27:28	+jan6	cold rain is the worst, warm rain is the best tho
2018-12-04 18:27:33	~ben	makes for a good day to stay inside
2018-12-04 18:27:34	rgdrake	-35 and wet is dangerous
2018-12-04 18:27:55	+jan6	you'd be literally an ice statue by then, lol ^
2018-12-04 18:28:10	~ben	-35 is no fun
2018-12-04 18:28:36	~ben	only had a couple of those last winter
2018-12-04 18:28:42	~ben	and it was mostly windchill
2018-12-04 18:30:34	rgdrake	ok, so for my bot, twitter public feed reader?
2018-12-04 18:30:53	rgdrake	searches based on subjet?
2018-12-04 18:31:13	+jan6	why twitter tho
2018-12-04 18:31:18	~ben	you could do mastodon
2018-12-04 18:31:22	+jan6	we don't use twitter around these parts
2018-12-04 18:31:33	rgdrake	smart, don't be a data product

2018-12-04 18:40:29	hyperboredoubt	No, I can't unfortunately.
2018-12-04 18:41:23	+jan6	why not?
2018-12-04 18:42:07	+jan6	log into a tilde, like ~team, have weechat or something, or a bouncer, running, and boom

2018-12-04 18:43:11	hyperboredoubt	Besides the fact that I don't know how to do that, my internet craps out a lot.
2018-12-04 18:43:32	+jan6	is this about running literally any nes game in animal crossing, kirch ?
2018-12-04 18:43:55	kirch	yes
2018-12-04 18:44:13	kirch	hyperboredoubt: you ssh into the server & run chat, right?
2018-12-04 18:44:22	hyperboredoubt	Yes.
2018-12-04 18:44:39	kirch	one additional step: ssh into the server, run "screen", then run "chat"
2018-12-04 18:45:17	kirch	if you get disconnected, ssh into the server, run "screen -RRD" - and your chat will be there already running
2018-12-04 18:45:23	+jan6	just use byobu/screen/tmux, hyperboredoubt, ssh team -> (probably already in byobu) -> weechat -> ctrl-a d -> disconnect /../ connect again -> (probably already in byobu) -> boom
2018-12-04 18:45:32	+jan6	screen is my choice though
2018-12-04 18:47:57	 *	jan6 does 'ssh -t team -- screen -Udr' so he'll get thrown into screen on connect
2018-12-04 18:48:17	+jan6	too lazy to make an alias for that
2018-12-04 18:49:46	+jan6	kirch: what's RRD supposed to do?
2018-12-04 18:50:19	+jan6	why not just -dr to disconnect other connections, and reconnect you?
2018-12-04 18:51:03	kirch	I find RRD disconnects and connects you, but also if nothing's found it creates a new session
2018-12-04 18:51:50	+jan6	hm, kay
2018-12-04 18:52:04	kirch	I use ssh -t <whatever> screen -RRD
2018-12-04 18:52:06	+jan6	I sure would like a sign that the session died
2018-12-04 18:52:21	+jan6	we're running so similar ;P
2018-12-04 18:52:25	kirch	IIRC there's a blip - and ofc nothing is in the session
2018-12-04 18:52:51	+jan6	protip, use -- to separate the remote command, so ssh doesn't try to find it's options there and stuff
2018-12-04 18:56:18	kirch	it's usually pretty clever about where that happens
2018-12-04 18:57:20	rgdrake	mastadon will not send me the confirmation email

2018-12-04 19:03:05	rgdrake	how do I message him w/o an account?
2018-12-04 19:03:56	~ben	rgdrake: on tilde.zone?
2018-12-04 19:04:04	~ben	or on another instance?
2018-12-04 19:08:55	rgdrake	ok I have a tilde.zone address, I'll look at the API in a bit
2018-12-04 19:10:09	~ben	did the mail come through?
2018-12-04 19:15:59	hyperboredoubt	It seems that tildes.net is invite-only. How do I get an invitation?
2018-12-04 19:16:15	kirch	hyperboredoubt: 
2018-12-04 19:16:29	kirch	can I DM you?
2018-12-04 19:16:51	hyperboredoubt	Sure.
2018-12-04 19:17:10	kirch	I dunno *how* I got in - but I still have all my invites :3
2018-12-04 19:17:46	@cmccabe	i think the tildes.net invites were all replenished not long ago.

2018-12-04 19:23:18	rgdrake	tildes.net is not this network?
2018-12-04 19:23:36	+jan6	it's a completely separate thing
2018-12-04 19:23:43	~ben	tildes.net is an invite-only reddit clone
2018-12-04 19:24:54	rgdrake	I'm not much into reddit
2018-12-04 19:31:27	kirch	me neither - not anymore - therefore I'm not much into tildes - except I somehow got invited and signed up ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2018-12-04 19:33:16	~ben	lol yeah same
2018-12-04 19:34:27	kirch	I can't resist being in a secret society of sorts

2018-12-04 19:37:25	~ben	oh you have different stuff on there
2018-12-04 19:37:28	kirch	done with git submodules ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2018-12-04 19:37:31	login	It doesn't even redirect... it just goes to the same ip lol
2018-12-04 19:37:33	~ben	nice
2018-12-04 19:37:44	~ben	login: what doesn't redirect?
2018-12-04 19:37:45	kirch	I was thinking I could sync them - or I could like just link back and forth? IDK

2018-12-04 19:38:07	~ben	yeah you can do it however you like

2018-12-04 19:40:42	login	!fucksgiven
2018-12-04 19:41:03	login	Oh yeah, only on #tildetown does that exist...
2018-12-04 19:41:13	~ben	what about it?
2018-12-04 19:41:59	login	It's just has the same IP address in its A record, rather than "redirecting" to tilde.team
2018-12-04 19:42:06	login	(redirecting to a tilde.team url)
2018-12-04 19:42:31	~ben	??
2018-12-04 19:43:04	~ben	anything pointing to the primary ip will end up redirecting to tilde.team
2018-12-04 19:43:26	~ben	but i just provisioned a letsencrypt cert and added nginx vhosts for it
2018-12-04 19:44:05	login	will it redirect or will it just serve the same web page?
2018-12-04 19:44:40	login	How does nginx know which domain name was used to access the server?
2018-12-04 19:45:06	login	i.e., what's the main idea behind detecting different domain names when they all point to the same server ip?
2018-12-04 19:45:31	fosslinux	reverse proxy it's called
2018-12-04 19:46:36	kirch	You can redirect with html meta tags
2018-12-04 19:47:11	kirch	nginx can make wildcard domains do whatever
2018-12-04 19:48:12	~ben	no it's not a reverse proxy
2018-12-04 19:48:13	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-04 19:48:31	~ben	nginx uses SNI to decide which site to serve
2018-12-04 19:48:35	login	but both fuckup.club and tilde.team serve the exact same html, so how can there be different html meta tags...
2018-12-04 19:48:42	~ben	???
2018-12-04 19:48:46	~ben	what do you mean 
2018-12-04 19:48:50	login	Ah, server-name indication...
2018-12-04 19:48:56	~ben	it serves from the same webroot
2018-12-04 19:49:21	login	I remember signal getting in trouble for using fake sni to work in blocked contries using google
2018-12-04 19:49:50	login	they eventually started using amazon after google, and both blocked this mechanism of circumventing censorship

2018-12-04 19:52:27	kirch	I'm thinking meta tags to redirect things without having PHP to send specific headers
2018-12-04 19:52:52	kirch	although I'd love to learn how the "notify" trick works to send data to/from the server on plain ol' html
2018-12-04 19:53:10	kirch	I haven't seen any description/tutorial of how to make that happen
2018-12-04 19:54:54	login	troido will be able to provide a good explanation
2018-12-04 19:55:05	login	https://tilde.town/~troido/notifytest/
2018-12-04 19:55:21	login	So each letter is a different endpoint, and the server can access the atime of each endpoint
2018-12-04 19:55:44	login	So the server polls the atime of each endpoint to reconstruct the order in which the end points were sent
2018-12-04 19:55:48	login	I mean accessed
2018-12-04 19:55:53	login	And saves that information to a file
2018-12-04 19:56:05	login	The client polls the file on the server to update the "client view"
2018-12-04 19:56:26	login	It's very noisy, and sends *lots* of requests (polling, plus one request for every single symbol)
2018-12-04 19:56:54	kirch	SO - notify is checking the last-access times for all these things, and reconstructing the message from that?
2018-12-04 19:56:55	login	Oh wait, the server doesn't poll the atime of each endpoint, it uses inotify 
2018-12-04 19:56:59	login	The client uses polling though..
2018-12-04 19:57:59	login	Something like that...
2018-12-04 20:00:06	~ben	juse use php lol
2018-12-04 20:00:20	kirch	where's the fun in that?
2018-12-04 20:00:54	~ben	it's fun if you're a masochist
2018-12-04 20:02:51	cdmnky	lol mastodon today is really full of energy
2018-12-04 20:03:11	cdmnky	all the tumblr folks coming over is making things interesting
2018-12-04 20:03:20	login	ben: lol
2018-12-04 20:03:31	login	so php is the sadist then?
2018-12-04 20:03:39	~ben	?
2018-12-04 20:03:41	~ben	what
2018-12-04 20:03:42	troido	inotify checks the files to be read. There's 256 empty files (named 0 through 255) for each "connection". Each connection has its own directory with a long random name. By reading from specific files the client can send one byte of information at a time. The connection the other way just consists of the client periodically reading a file on the server
2018-12-04 20:03:55	login	ben: if we're the masochist for using php, then php must be the sadist right?
2018-12-04 20:04:11	~ben	still what?
2018-12-04 20:04:13	login	cdmnky: mastodon's strength is in its decentralisation
2018-12-04 20:04:23	~ben	it doesn't have to be a pair

2018-12-04 20:04:40	~ben	at least somewhat
2018-12-04 20:04:43	mushmouth	i mean we all know that

2018-12-04 20:05:10	login	troido: how fast can the connections be sent?
2018-12-04 20:05:24	login	in the client-to-server direction...
2018-12-04 20:05:34	troido	login it's slow. I don't have exact numbers
2018-12-04 20:05:52	troido	also, it depends on your internet speed
2018-12-04 20:05:53	login	how does it know which order the files were sent in?
2018-12-04 20:05:54	giacomo	hi
2018-12-04 20:06:03	login	hi
2018-12-04 20:06:20	login	it doesn't let you know in unix time right, does inotify have some kind of callback thing?
2018-12-04 20:06:42	troido	login it reads the file and waits until it get's back the content of the file (empty) before it sends the next request
2018-12-04 20:08:05	troido	you could probably make it faster by reading multiple files at the same time in different directories
2018-12-04 20:08:43	troido	but I haven't really bothered to make it better. I just made the proof of concept
2018-12-04 20:09:15	kirch	my anonymous tumblr account now has an anonymous masto account ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2018-12-04 22:16:33	kirch	Hot tip amcclure_: Blinkenshell has password login so create a key there and put it everywhere else so you can always ssh in to add new keys in places that don't have password login

2018-12-04 22:47:06	sebboh	y'all remember that person who hacked Wolf3d or Doom to spawn a monster for each process and set it to kill the process when the player killed the monster?  The author wrote a great blog post about it (or page on a homepage maybe!) in which they accidentally shot init and brought the host system down. :)
2018-12-04 22:47:22	~tomasino	that's super fun
2018-12-04 22:47:44	~tomasino	ahh yes, there goes the train that's nearby the new apartment complex. Clockwork

2018-12-04 23:32:12	ahriman	dat QoS doe
2018-12-04 23:32:13	~ben	that's a strong priority on ethernet
2018-12-04 23:32:29	~ben	15 megabytes/sec tho
2018-12-04 23:32:34	ahriman	daaaaaamn
2018-12-04 23:32:40	~ben	not bad
2018-12-04 23:32:48	~ben	50gb in 1 hour
2018-12-04 23:33:30	mushmouth	yeah that pretty good
2018-12-04 23:33:40	mushmouth	wish i had that speed
2018-12-04 23:34:35	mushmouth	im kind of used to now that the canada post is doing the rotation strike thing
2018-12-04 23:34:46	mushmouth	im expecting like china shipping from west coast canada
2018-12-04 23:34:54	~ben	the canad post affects your internet speed? :o
2018-12-04 23:34:58	ahriman	my reaction to the speed: https://ttm.sh/b-.jpg
2018-12-04 23:35:07	mushmouth	ben: no my shipping :(
2018-12-04 23:35:19	mushmouth	which is equally as important
2018-12-04 23:35:23	~ben	what speed do you get ahriman ?
2018-12-04 23:35:33	~ben	mushmouth: i'm used to 2 day amazon prime lol
2018-12-04 23:35:49	mushmouth	ben: right now. im expecting like 30 days for something within canada
2018-12-04 23:35:58	mushmouth	could be in ontario
2018-12-04 23:35:59	~ben	jfc
2018-12-04 23:36:08	~ben	probably not from amazon though
2018-12-04 23:36:13	ahriman	im allotted "300Mbit/s" but in reality with overhead, attenuation, etc, i'll see like 240Mbits wired
2018-12-04 23:36:23	ahriman	and less wireless which i'm usually wireless
2018-12-04 23:36:37	~ben	i'm allotted 100mbits
2018-12-04 23:36:48	ahriman	so you're getting like 115Mbits
2018-12-04 23:36:49	~ben	i guess my pc is on ethernet
2018-12-04 23:36:52	~ben	ye
2018-12-04 23:36:57	ahriman	luckyyyy
2018-12-04 23:37:06	ahriman	i wish i got 15% more than allotted
2018-12-04 23:37:13	~ben	i have charter/spectrum
2018-12-04 23:37:17	~ben	whatever they want to call it
2018-12-04 23:37:24	mushmouth	i can't stand wireless even if the computer/hardware is all stable for it
2018-12-04 23:37:26	~ben	not as bad as comcast
2018-12-04 23:37:36	ahriman	but im more than happy with 240Mbits, even though it's 20% loss from attenuation/overhead
2018-12-04 23:37:39	~ben	my laptop doesn't even have an ethernet port
2018-12-04 23:37:47	mushmouth	i'd pay for an adapter ben
2018-12-04 23:37:49	~ben	if i'm on my laptop i'm using wireless
2018-12-04 23:37:51	~ben	why
2018-12-04 23:37:54	~ben	it's just as fast
2018-12-04 23:37:58	mushmouth	i hate wireless too many problems
2018-12-04 23:38:06	ahriman	i never have problems
2018-12-04 23:38:07	mushmouth	when it comes to me and wireless
2018-12-04 23:38:08	ahriman	with wireless
2018-12-04 23:38:09	mushmouth	at least
2018-12-04 23:38:11	~ben	yeah me neither
2018-12-04 23:38:19	mushmouth	i just have shit ton of problems all the time
2018-12-04 23:38:29	~ben	once i got the debian iwlwifi drivers/firmware whatever it's been gr8 8/8
2018-12-04 23:38:43	~ben	signal strength fades a bit quicker than on windows but ehh
2018-12-04 23:39:06	ahriman	my room mates and i have like 5 firesticks on this same wireless router, so im going to get another access point and tie it to the network to get better wireless speeds on my laptop
2018-12-04 23:39:08	mushmouth	im too used to the point of not even bothering installing wireles drivers/firmware
2018-12-04 23:39:24	~ben	lol there's your problem then
2018-12-04 23:39:33	~ben	no drivers no worky
2018-12-04 23:39:34	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-04 23:39:52	~ben	ok time to put that aspare drive in the new box
2018-12-04 23:39:56	~ben	bbiab
2018-12-04 23:40:06	ahriman	okait
2018-12-04 23:40:23	mushmouth	ethernet just werks (tm) so no point in bothering with wireless imo
2018-12-04 23:41:33	mushmouth	ben: i bought a ethernet adapter to usb for my macbook air
2018-12-04 23:41:47	mushmouth	because wireless was becoming too much of a pain
2018-12-04 23:46:08	kirch	Why don't they make wifi adapters that just pop in the Ethernet port? 
2018-12-04 23:46:53	kirch	They used to make SD cards that were WiFi adapters for Palm Pilots
2018-12-04 23:47:54	 *	kirch suddenly realized he has never tried to connect a smartphone to his Palm Pilot via Bluetooth

2018-12-05 00:40:36	stompy	the more i look at it
2018-12-05 00:40:42	stompy	weechat is just irssi with sidebars
2018-12-05 00:40:50	stompy	i do like how it can connect to multiple servers tho
2018-12-05 00:41:03	stompy	lets see how it behaves under tmux tho
2018-12-05 00:41:12	rgdrake	couldn't find how to get access to the federated stream on a mastodon server with my bot
2018-12-05 00:41:15	stompy	i was using smuxi but it was eating 150mb ram

2018-12-05 01:03:42	login	Alright, so the new fad is to use fuckup.club instead of tilde.team?
2018-12-05 01:03:52	~ben	and just attach and detach your ssh/mosh as needed
2018-12-05 01:03:59	~ben	login: it can be if you like
2018-12-05 01:04:36	login	Will it be possible to have a different page served for the same URL (but whose domain is fuckup.club instead of tilde.team)?
2018-12-05 01:04:47	~ben	??
2018-12-05 01:04:49	login	In other words, can login.fuckup.club/blog be different from tilde.team/~login/blog?
2018-12-05 01:04:52	~ben	no
2018-12-05 01:04:53	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-05 01:05:02	~ben	unless you ask me to configure something specially
2018-12-05 01:05:22	login	Well, I can just use js to modify the page by looking at window.location
2018-12-05 01:05:40	login	It'll serve both pages, but show different pages for different window.location...
2018-12-05 01:05:41	~ben	you oculd probably do something with php
2018-12-05 01:05:42	stompy	ben: but i use tmux locally :D
2018-12-05 01:05:47	stompy	no need to keep it runnin remotely

2018-12-05 01:05:48	~ben	that's fine stompy :P
2018-12-05 01:06:04	~ben	but the point of running it remotely is that it stays connected for you
2018-12-05 01:06:08	login	I didn't know php worked on tilde.team, and also that php could somehow distinguish fuckup.club from tilde.team
2018-12-05 01:06:09	stompy	tmux is one of the few apps that like
2018-12-05 01:06:12	stompy	changed my computing life
2018-12-05 01:06:27	stompy	i used to keep a tty open outside of Xorg and switch back when i had to do system stuff
2018-12-05 01:06:30	stompy	but now like

2018-12-05 01:18:13	stompy	tulsa is a tiny bit more liberal, but a liberal town in oklahoma basically means you wont get beat up being black after dark, and there might be 2-3 unitarian churches

2018-12-05 01:22:03	stompy	they'll let the dog shit on the floor, the dishes get moldy, but they like to go on about starting communes and living off the earth and shit like that
2018-12-05 01:22:20	stompy	like dude, you have no construction skills, you cant cook without a microwave, you steal pot from your roommate, you are not cut out to be in a commune
2018-12-05 01:22:23	%ubergeek	sounds like most preppers too
2018-12-05 01:22:56	login	btw, living in a commune, isolated and off the earth, is the opposite of trade and capitalism
2018-12-05 01:23:04	%ubergeek	went camping with a prepper, and he couldn't start a fire to save his life, with matches
2018-12-05 01:23:09	stompy	im cool with people who want to be off grid but like 70% are just running their mouth, what they want is a place away from people with someone to take care of them

2018-12-05 01:23:26	%ubergeek	But, he couldn't wait to go oof the grid, and take over the country

2018-12-05 01:23:58	stompy	well, i dont have a problem with capitalism in its base form i think the problem is human greed and thats why ideas like communism never work
2018-12-05 01:24:05	%ubergeek	I have two dogs that do that, sadly...  One is a rescue who is terrified of outdoors, and the other is a doxie who doesn't give shit about training
2018-12-05 01:24:13	%ubergeek	I don't let it sit there, though
2018-12-05 01:24:26	stompy	i dont think theres anything wrong with making money but if you take advantage of people and steal from them to enrich yourself you are an evil fuck

2018-12-05 01:31:32	stompy	neat bot
2018-12-05 01:31:59	stompy	i ran a couple supybots on another server
2018-12-05 01:32:04	stompy	i oughta find the conf files
2018-12-05 01:32:49	login	filling banks up with lines?
2018-12-05 01:32:58	stompy	yeah, clog up the lines
2018-12-05 01:33:01	stompy	so they dont get anything done
2018-12-05 01:33:01	login	lines = those in which people stand in lines?
2018-12-05 01:33:07	stompy	clog up the lines applying for frivolous loans
2018-12-05 01:33:14	stompy	and sue them for discrimination when they dont approve them
2018-12-05 01:33:24	login	And "becoming police"?
2018-12-05 01:33:35	stompy	yeah, so you warn the other hippies when theyre gonna raid
2018-12-05 01:33:41	stompy	i mean hes a comedian theyre just jokes
2018-12-05 01:33:45	stompy	i thought it was pretty funny
2018-12-05 01:34:14	login	oh, so an insider in the police
2018-12-05 01:34:17	stompy	yea
2018-12-05 01:34:45	login	I'm sure all the big corporations have spies in such posts. I mean, not traditional spies, just informants.
2018-12-05 01:35:03	login	So they know what the gov's future plans are (so they can prepare for legislative changes and are not caught off-guard etc.)
2018-12-05 01:35:11	stompy	i enjoy that someone can take a depressing reality and milk it for good jokes though
2018-12-05 01:35:19	stompy	honestly i just want to be left alone
2018-12-05 01:35:41	login	humour is really difficult to create...
2018-12-05 01:35:48	stompy	eh not really
2018-12-05 01:35:53	stompy	if youre naturally funny
2018-12-05 01:36:07	stompy	but its painful when people arent try to go on stage
2018-12-05 01:36:10	login	well, they don't teach it in school, let's put it like that...
2018-12-05 01:36:13	stompy	they have a local openmic at a bar downtown
2018-12-05 01:36:16	stompy	its so cringey
2018-12-05 01:36:26	login	Do you occasionally get someone awesome?
2018-12-05 01:36:29	stompy	like yeah i get it, your grandma doesnt know how her cell phone works, wow hilarious
2018-12-05 01:36:31	stompy	lmao no
2018-12-05 01:36:32	stompy	its oklahoma
2018-12-05 01:37:10	login	how does one improve without practice?
2018-12-05 01:37:38	login	But i guess practising in front of so many people is more embarassing than practising in front of friends and trusted individuals
2018-12-05 01:37:45	stompy	well what gets me is like
2018-12-05 01:37:54	stompy	ive seen open mic people go up there holding their phones
2018-12-05 01:38:03	~ben	to read notes off?
2018-12-05 01:38:04	stompy	like looking at their phones to segue into other material and etc
2018-12-05 01:38:07	stompy	yeah
2018-12-05 01:38:07	~ben	yeouch
2018-12-05 01:38:09	login	lol, so they're just reading off r/jokes?
2018-12-05 01:38:15	stompy	might as well be
2018-12-05 01:38:44	login	I guess when they do it, it's cringey. But when pewdiepie does it, it gets 2M views and some ad/sponsorship revenie
2018-12-05 01:38:46	login	*revenue
2018-12-05 01:39:10	stompy	fuck that guy
2018-12-05 01:39:24	login	That guy has literally optimised for minimum content/maximum engagement
2018-12-05 01:39:24	stompy	i hate youtube-famous people
2018-12-05 01:39:27	stompy	yeah
2018-12-05 01:39:31	cdmnky	hey, at least it isn't tob who slurps his tea in the mic lol
2018-12-05 01:39:38	stompy	when i see videos begging me to subscribe i just close the video
2018-12-05 01:39:39	login	My favourite brand of YouTuber are the educational ones
2018-12-05 01:39:49	stompy	i hate shit like those epic meal time douchebags
2018-12-05 01:40:02	login	"The cut"
2018-12-05 01:40:57	login	I especially like educational channels that don't have below 100k, because their videos are more varied and they try different things to grow their audience
2018-12-05 01:41:27	login	i like watching them try different strategies... it's probably bad of me to like to see that struggle behind their eyes...
2018-12-05 01:41:33	stompy	theres so much cringe on youtube
2018-12-05 01:41:41	login	And sometimes notice when they're recording with less sleep...
2018-12-05 01:42:02	stompy	people trying to hard to get famous/go viral, people who arent funny, stupid mens rights jerkoffs, its just pathetic
2018-12-05 01:42:13	stompy	the only people im subscribed to are people who upload full albums
2018-12-05 01:42:13	login	YouTube is so big that one can literally find almost anything they want, and discover things they didn't know they liked...
2018-12-05 01:42:35	stompy	santiago bernhardt has a great channel, he just uploads full obscure albums
2018-12-05 01:42:40	login	stompy: your yt feed is probably a result of your location's general characteristics
2018-12-05 01:43:03	login	Covers?
2018-12-05 01:43:11	login	Or just self-made/licensed albums?
2018-12-05 01:43:12	stompy	oh im just talkin about people attention seeking
2018-12-05 01:43:13	stompy	no
2018-12-05 01:43:14	TildeBot	no u infinity stompy
2018-12-05 01:43:16	stompy	full albums
2018-12-05 01:43:18	stompy	like
2018-12-05 01:43:20	stompy	pirated
2018-12-05 01:44:18	login	If you look in the yt descriptions, youtube says it's licensed
2018-12-05 01:44:38	login	they probably have a deal so that any such licensed music gets ads run on them and pay the income from that...
2018-12-05 01:44:52	login	Not to the uploader, but the one who gave yt the license...
2018-12-05 01:50:11	~ben	welp the only ethernet cable i have left is 50ft long
2018-12-05 01:50:19	~ben	and it needs to go about 3 inches
2018-12-05 01:50:39	~ben	from the box i picked up today to the router sitting on top of it
2018-12-05 01:51:04	cdmnky	I could use that 50foot long eth cable to run upstairs to my desktop lol
2018-12-05 01:51:45	cdmnky	funnily enough, there's a hole drilled in the floor from when we had cable upstairs
2018-12-05 01:52:15	~ben	do it
2018-12-05 01:53:40	cdmnky	actually, it wouldn't look half bad. downstairs has drop ceilings
2018-12-05 01:54:56	~ben	ok but now the question is 
2018-12-05 01:55:11	~ben	do I use the 50 ft eithernet or the wifi card
2018-12-05 01:55:21	%ubergeek	lift the switch/endpoint by 6" to give you clearance...
2018-12-05 01:55:34	~ben	hm?
2018-12-05 01:55:49	%ubergeek	Oh, nm.
2018-12-05 01:55:55	%ubergeek	I read that as 3" short
2018-12-05 01:56:02	%ubergeek	use the cable :)
2018-12-05 01:56:04	 *	cdmnky is perfectly content with his b/g/n pcie wifi card though
2018-12-05 01:56:04	~ben	lol no it only needs to be that long
2018-12-05 01:56:21	~ben	I mean my Internet is only 100mbit anyway
2018-12-05 01:56:33	~ben	can easily max that out over wifi
2018-12-05 01:56:34	%ubergeek	just zip tie/velco strap it, if you want to keep your sanity 6 months from now
2018-12-05 01:56:40	cdmnky	wait, isn't b/g/n called "wifi 3" now? and ac wifi 4?
2018-12-05 01:56:41	~ben	lol srsly
2018-12-05 01:56:45	~ben	idk
2018-12-05 01:56:56	%ubergeek	AC Delta-T 4
2018-12-05 01:57:13	cdmnky	I heard they were ditching 802.11/ad/ for wifi 5
2018-12-05 01:57:29	 *	ubergeek still has 802.11a devices...
2018-12-05 01:57:33	~ben	oh wow
2018-12-05 01:57:41	%ubergeek	Fitbit scale.
2018-12-05 01:57:49	 *	cdmnky still uses USB1 for his ipod nano
2018-12-05 01:57:49	~ben	my router is super beefy
2018-12-05 01:57:50	%ubergeek	thankfully, used only once per day
2018-12-05 01:58:06	~ben	ac with some crazy mimo
2018-12-05 01:58:16	~ben	it was like $250
2018-12-05 01:58:32	cdmnky	actually, I have a 1st gen 512MB shuffle. the one that was a usb stick with buttons and a 3.5mm jack
2018-12-05 01:58:52	cdmnky	can't fit more than an album or two on it though
2018-12-05 01:58:56	%ubergeek	My router is a TMobile one.  They gave it to me for free
2018-12-05 01:59:21	%ubergeek	It's pretty awesome.  Built in VPN (Client and server), 2 USB ports (One USB 3), etc etc
2018-12-05 01:59:35	~ben	is TMobile your ISP?
2018-12-05 01:59:37	%ubergeek	And, it tunes the wifi calling with some chip in it
2018-12-05 01:59:41	%ubergeek	No, Spectrum
2018-12-05 01:59:47	~ben	oh same
2018-12-05 02:00:08	~ben	Verizon is the only carrier with decent coverage up here
2018-12-05 02:00:14	%ubergeek	at one point, TMobile was pushing their routers, so you always could get calls (When their service was spotty)
2018-12-05 02:00:24	~ben	well that's mostly in the UP 
2018-12-05 02:00:40	~ben	I bet I could use something else here 
2018-12-05 02:00:45	~ben	but I go up there often enough
2018-12-05 02:02:53	%ubergeek	UP?  Southern Canada, right? :P
2018-12-05 02:03:15	cdmnky	ooh, my java assignment this week is to write a class that stores a fraction
2018-12-05 02:04:05	hyperboredoubt	Off-topic, my submission for Cosmic Voyage is starting to read like an report of a sexual assault. :\
2018-12-05 02:04:47	~ben	lol more like northern ontario
2018-12-05 02:05:06	~ben	it's way north of most of the populated areas of canada
2018-12-05 02:28:18	cdmnky	I did a thing gopher://sdf.org/1/users/cdmnky/stuff/

2018-12-05 02:31:02	cdmnky	I should probably put a return link on there

2018-12-05 13:57:28	login	So the current directory doesn't exist.

2018-12-05 13:58:33	+jan6	well, I guess you can always edit your ssh alias to execute rc on logging in ;P
2018-12-05 13:59:08	+jan6	or use "ssh unkt rc" manually

2018-12-05 16:36:35	~ben	what's a tar devil?
2018-12-05 16:37:20	SinaCutie	They are tar candies. The ones I have taste extremely minty and also tarry (a very smokey flavour)
2018-12-05 16:37:34	SinaCutie	https://inktank.fi/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tervapirut-Tar-devils.jpg
2018-12-05 16:37:43	SinaCutie	They look like devil heads. xD
2018-12-05 16:38:07	~ben	looks like an interesting candy :P
2018-12-05 16:38:12	SinaCutie	Some of my American friends say they're not candy 'cause they have no sugar, but I disagree
2018-12-05 16:38:30	SinaCutie	Also some say it tastes like a throat lozenge because of the mint, only as if it's been smoked in a fire
2018-12-05 16:38:43	SinaCutie	XD
2018-12-05 16:38:45	~ben	smoked cough drop
2018-12-05 16:38:47	~ben	lol
2018-12-05 16:39:17	SinaCutie	Basically what people say
2018-12-05 16:39:22	SinaCutie	I don't see it, but I can understand. xD
2018-12-05 16:39:31	~ben	that doesn't really sound like my thing, but ok!
2018-12-05 16:39:43	SinaCutie	It is usually abhorrent for most non-Finns :D 
2018-12-05 16:40:08	~ben	lots of black licorice too right?
2018-12-05 16:40:38	~ben	when i visited some friends in denmark a couple years ago they got a round of anise flavored shots and i think i almost died

2018-12-05 16:42:00	SinaCutie	But I wasn't thinking that far ahead

2018-12-05 16:48:10	 *	jan6 likes http://spaceuncharted.com/
2018-12-05 16:49:53	+jan6	it's impressively light app, and rather light game itself too, c'mon, tehy even have WebOS support!
2018-12-05 16:55:53	+jan6	make sure to play the maximum speed games at first, the "1x speed" is an absolute crawl, which is perfect for strategic play over a few weeks
2018-12-05 16:56:20	kirch	there's a new runescape app... no idea if it's official and hooks into old runescape accounts
2018-12-05 16:56:54	+jan6	or if it silently logs your credentials in the background

2018-12-05 17:46:14	~ben	it's up and running!
2018-12-05 17:46:28	~ben	speaking of that i need to switch the nameservers on bsd.tilde.team
2018-12-05 17:46:36	robdrake	ok, just a trivia game using the jeopardy questions I got ahold of, or should I try and implement jeopardy?
2018-12-05 17:46:56	+jan6	why?
2018-12-05 17:47:29	+jan6	but sure, if you wish to, implement a whole tiered game
2018-12-05 17:47:36	+aewens	So how would one utilize .tilde now then?
2018-12-05 17:47:50	+jan6	just use the dns servers listed in the tildegit wiki
2018-12-05 17:48:09	robdrake	ben, w/ namecheap and your own dns servers, you might be able to register .tilde
2018-12-05 17:48:19	+jan6	wellll
2018-12-05 17:48:33	+jan6	he will, if you lend him a few tons of cash
2018-12-05 17:49:10	robdrake	If I had tons of cash, I wouldn't be here, I'd continue using roblifehackc.com past December
2018-12-05 17:49:24	+jan6	tld registration is expensive AF
2018-12-05 17:49:38	~ben	aewens: https://tildegit.org/.tilde/.tilde/wiki/NS-List
2018-12-05 17:49:50	~ben	there's already a handful of dns servers for .tilde robdrake 
2018-12-05 17:49:52	robdrake	why I suggested namecheap
2018-12-05 17:49:55	~ben	see that list i just posted
2018-12-05 17:50:05	robdrake	oh ok, just trying to help
2018-12-05 17:50:12	~ben	registering a tld is in the range of $200,000
2018-12-05 17:50:22	robdrake	oh, a new one
2018-12-05 17:50:25	+jan6	yeah
2018-12-05 17:50:29	robdrake	fuck
2018-12-05 17:50:31	~ben	so we're just using our own nameservers
2018-12-05 17:50:32	+jan6	lol
2018-12-05 17:50:44	+jan6	that's why namecheap won't work, lol
2018-12-05 17:51:05	robdrake	I probably have the $200k in a trust fund I can't touch
2018-12-05 17:51:19	kirch	marry me, robdrake 
2018-12-05 17:51:45	~ben	lol srsly
2018-12-05 17:51:47	+jan6	iirc you also kinda needed proof you'll be able to keep it up and running or such
2018-12-05 17:51:49	~ben	i don't have that kind of cash
2018-12-05 17:52:04	robdrake	it'd be a premarital asset, and it's written to not interfere w/ my SSI and Medicaid, plus I'm already married
2018-12-05 17:52:21	+jan6	if we all donated a little bit into a common .tilde pool, then in 5 years, we probably could get it ;P
2018-12-05 17:52:52	+jan6	who cares if you're married, just live with multiple people, heh
2018-12-05 17:53:22	robdrake	and right now my trustee is being a real asshole

2018-12-05 17:54:11	%ubergeek	Creating a TLD requires ~185K US fee, a 5K US deposit to be considered, and proof of $10 million/yr revenue to "ensure operation"
2018-12-05 17:54:50	+jan6	heh
2018-12-05 17:54:54	robdrake	yeah
2018-12-05 17:55:00	%ubergeek	All of that is really gate keeping, imo
2018-12-05 17:55:07	kirch	indeeed
2018-12-05 17:55:11	+jan6	not all, but it IS extraggated
2018-12-05 17:55:15	kirch	ICANN gotta make that cheddar
2018-12-05 17:55:16	robdrake	yes, keep the little people out
2018-12-05 17:55:40	%ubergeek	I get the fee, the deposit, and even proof of revenue, but not at the levels they put
2018-12-05 17:55:48	+jan6	^
2018-12-05 17:56:27	+jan6	it's good in the sense that we don't have literally millions of tlds tho
2018-12-05 17:56:44	kirch	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I guess
2018-12-05 17:56:56	+jan6	not much else it's good for tho
2018-12-05 17:57:17	%ubergeek	It's the same deal with broadcast band AM/FM in the US:  Artificial levels to keep "small game" out
2018-12-05 17:57:40	%ubergeek	OpenNIC has a pretty good plan:  All new tld's need to be voted on by members.
2018-12-05 17:57:41	+jan6	TildeCo & Co. when? the next 10 million company with just a single objective; to register .tilde XD
2018-12-05 17:57:47	~ben	artificial scarcity
2018-12-05 17:57:59	%ubergeek	And members are those who proven they can run a Tier 1 for X months
2018-12-05 17:58:04	~ben	lol we already have .tilde
2018-12-05 17:58:17	+jan6	dns-free .tilde 
2018-12-05 17:58:20	~ben	it just requires setting configuring your machine to use different nameservers

2018-12-05 17:58:50	~ben	lol
2018-12-05 17:58:53	+aewens	I can merge my dotfiles I had split for macOS and Ubuntu into one single repo
2018-12-05 17:59:03	~ben	nice
2018-12-05 17:59:03	%ubergeek	I have a "fsck.this.guy.now" in there :P
2018-12-05 17:59:10	+jan6	but you can't unsplit
2018-12-05 17:59:11	~ben	lel
2018-12-05 17:59:51	+jan6	hostfiles are for the OG, it's the way REAL hackers/developers do it ;P
2018-12-05 17:59:52	+aewens	jan6: With `stow` you can separate the dotfiles into folders and easily include as needed
2018-12-05 18:00:12	+jan6	kay
2018-12-05 18:00:33	+aewens	So I can just do `cd dotfiles && stow macos` and only bring in the macOS specific stuff
2018-12-05 18:00:44	+jan6	cool I guess
2018-12-05 18:01:07	~ben	aewens: have a look at tomasino's makefile
2018-12-05 18:01:16	~ben	https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles
2018-12-05 18:01:17	TildeBot	GitHub - jamestomasino/dotfiles: My dotfiles https://bhh.sh/5h

2018-12-05 18:01:22	+jan6	though you could also do cp -r dotfiles/macos ~
2018-12-05 18:01:30	~ben	stow is far neater
2018-12-05 18:01:32	+aewens	Yeah, tomasino's makefile is what inspired me to look into stow. It just finally made it's way into the todo queue
2018-12-05 18:01:53	+jan6	todo? heh, and I though you were chaotic
2018-12-05 18:02:35	+aewens	The todo queue is a multi-branching system that spans over several kanban boards. Trust me, it's chaotic
2018-12-05 18:02:52	+jan6	hmm
2018-12-05 18:02:55	+jan6	kay then
2018-12-05 18:03:06	+jan6	I sure hope you're telling the truts
2018-12-05 18:03:13	+aewens	And some of the entries are made by the version of me that wakes up in the middle of the night and adds in 3 word todos like "Feed The Machine" with new tags added to it.
2018-12-05 18:03:39	+jan6	lol, this is getting a bit fantasy-cal
2018-12-05 18:03:46	+aewens	Still have no idea what that todo meant
2018-12-05 18:04:03	+jan6	you better keep that  tho
2018-12-05 18:04:13	+aewens	But it's still sitting in the "to revisit later" category in case I remember
2018-12-05 18:04:30	 *	jan6 feeds the machine
2018-12-05 18:04:41	 *	jan6 discovers he IS the machine
2018-12-05 18:04:56	 *	jan6 hears inception sounds going off in the distance
2018-12-05 18:04:56	+aewens	I'm sure whatever it was I was supposed to feed will appreciate when I remember to do so. However, it's been a few months so I hope it can survive that long
2018-12-05 18:05:18	+aewens	This is also why I don't have a pet right now.
2018-12-05 18:05:18	+jan6	Feed The Neural Net
2018-12-05 18:05:26	+jan6	by which I mean, me

2018-12-05 18:06:08	+aewens	I had a pet rock once. No idea where it went though
2018-12-05 18:06:26	+aewens	I think it's in one of my boxes somewhere in the garage?
2018-12-05 18:06:34	+jan6	at least you didn't kill it, it managed to escape before that ;L
2018-12-05 18:06:52	+aewens	Well, one or both of it's googly eyes probably fell off by now
2018-12-05 18:07:07	+aewens	It had one big one and one small one, it look hilarious

2018-12-05 18:11:05	+jan6	When I was a kid, someone told me the end of The Giver was ambiguous, which surprised me. I had just assumed Jonah died--because the book had a medal on the cover, and I knew grown-ups liked stories where sad stuff happens at the end for no reason.
2018-12-05 18:15:21	~ben	ahriman: you need to keep looping through the entire list

2018-12-05 18:35:31	~ben	i mean the us has the electoral college, but that is broken too in that it does the opposite of its intended effect
2018-12-05 18:36:03	%ubergeek	It's broken, because we turned it into a formula, rather than a check on populism
2018-12-05 18:36:33	~ben	yupps
2018-12-05 18:52:46	login	If the US moves away from first part the post to a "score" system (give each candidate a score from 1 to 10)
2018-12-05 18:53:21	login	that would be unlike any other voting system in the world, and thus satisfy the "US is different from other countries and that's good" requirement while being better for democracy
2018-12-05 18:53:31	login	better for US democracy
2018-12-05 18:53:56	login	But all the political apparatus that has already been developed will have to be re-engineered, so all parties but those that have nothing to lose are against it...
2018-12-05 18:54:32	login	So, in short, the US needs an Election Commission that is completely independent from any other branch of government...
2018-12-05 18:54:40	kirch	US doesn't _want_ to be better at democracy - if the people had a say they might choose policies that benefited them instead of the ruling class
2018-12-05 18:55:12	login	One has to make the people feel like they have a say without actually giving them a real power to change things...
2018-12-05 18:55:30	login	I mean, why not get a 100,000 signatures on change.org to change the way elections work?
2018-12-05 18:55:36	~ben	lol 
2018-12-05 18:55:45	~ben	there's no incentive for those in power to change anything
2018-12-05 18:56:04	login	If every party decides not to offer it, can the people choose to ask for it?
2018-12-05 18:56:09	~ben	offer what?
2018-12-05 18:56:15	login	offer a revamped election system
2018-12-05 18:56:45	login	I've heard of schemes where people trade votes in unfavourable counties to have their vote count better...
2018-12-05 18:56:46	~ben	it's not per-party
2018-12-05 18:57:00	login	But that becomes one of those prisoner's dilemma problems...
2018-12-05 18:57:14	kirch	probably easier to start locally, then spread to the state
2018-12-05 18:57:29	%ubergeek	WHat the US needs is a good, medium-city sized meteor to impact right about dead center of the CONUS...
2018-12-05 18:57:39	login	If no party in power will ask about election systems in referendums, and no party will make it a part of their promises, then how can the people ask for it?

2018-12-05 18:58:01	~ben	voter suppression is how they've won

2018-12-05 18:58:19	login	How do they make it selective?
2018-12-05 18:58:36	%ubergeek	By the calculations I did, a medium-sized city meteor impacting dead center, should reduce the US population by ~80%
2018-12-05 18:58:48	login	I mean, environmental terrorism hasn't taken a hold yet, but i feel like it's coming in the next decade

2018-12-05 18:59:05	login	ubergeek: but that's gerrymandering right? not voter supression...
2018-12-05 18:59:12	~ben	they group the districts so that non-whites are all in one district, making their votes count less
2018-12-05 18:59:22	~ben	gerrymandering is a form of voter suppression
2018-12-05 18:59:27	login	Ah
2018-12-05 18:59:42	%ubergeek	yes, voter suppression is easy:  close polling locations in minority-dense neighborhoods
2018-12-05 18:59:44	~ben	same with id laws
2018-12-05 18:59:47	~ben	that too
2018-12-05 19:00:03	login	I mean, if laws are breached, there is no mechanism of redressal after the election right?
2018-12-05 19:00:15	login	They can't just call another election because they found some cases of voters being misled...
2018-12-05 19:00:23	~ben	huh?
2018-12-05 19:00:26	%ubergeek	It's not exactly breaking the law, but if it does, after certification, nothing to be done

2018-12-05 19:04:41	login	if someone doesn't offer an email address when signing up, there's no way to recover or get another pub-key in at a later time, right?
2018-12-05 19:04:46	login	because how can you know it's the same person?
2018-12-05 19:05:09	@vilmibm	yes; you can't sign up without an email, though, so it hasn't been much of an issue

2018-12-05 19:21:43	%ubergeek	my guess, at least
2018-12-05 19:21:55	%ubergeek	quots don't always mean quotes.  It's highly shell specific
2018-12-05 19:22:14	~ben	hmmst
2018-12-05 19:22:14	%ubergeek	ie, echo "Hello my $var"

2018-12-05 19:23:49	arne	ok
2018-12-05 19:23:51	arne	my guess is
2018-12-05 19:24:57	arne	its parsing it as 9 echo "\ "< h1\ > "$* \ "< /h1\ > "
2018-12-05 19:25:13	+jan6	just use ' singlequotes'
2018-12-05 19:25:25	arne	incredibly. it worked
2018-12-05 19:25:52	+jan6	you version worked, or singlequotes worked?
2018-12-05 19:25:59	arne	singlequotes
2018-12-05 19:26:01	+jan6	noice
2018-12-05 19:26:40	+jan6	also you can mix them, echo 'hello <b>'" $name"'</b>'
2018-12-05 19:27:19	+jan6	might come handy, you never now

2018-12-05 19:47:32	sedbot	<ben> looks like it's in stylesheet.css
2018-12-05 19:47:35	+jan6	yeah
2018-12-05 19:47:39	+jan6	404 indeed
2018-12-05 19:47:42	~ben	needs a full path
2018-12-05 19:47:54	arne	lol i cant access the assets path
2018-12-05 19:48:02	+jan6	the spaceship ain't bad, just people like to know where exactly they're pointing to
2018-12-05 19:48:10	fosslinux	oh yep found
2018-12-05 19:48:15	~ben	especially when the font is tiny as shit
2018-12-05 19:48:34	arne	ok how do i make it not 403
2018-12-05 19:48:40	arne	https://1000.directory/assets/styles/fonts/
2018-12-05 19:48:41	fosslinux	404
2018-12-05 19:48:51	fosslinux	ohhh
2018-12-05 19:48:53	fosslinux	403
2018-12-05 19:48:54	fosslinux	rip
2018-12-05 19:49:01	fosslinux	permissions?
2018-12-05 19:49:03	+jan6	it's fine
2018-12-05 19:49:13	+jan6	we're not supposed to see your font library anyway
2018-12-05 19:49:27	~ben	webserver needs +rx permissions
2018-12-05 19:49:41	+jan6	would need to add a rule to the server conf, to say "let people see this directory"
2018-12-05 19:49:47	+jan6	nah
2018-12-05 19:49:57	~ben	??
2018-12-05 19:50:01	+jan6	403 is server saying "YOU don't have permission, sir"
2018-12-05 19:50:04	fosslinux	19:49:27            ~ben | webserver needs +rx permissions
2018-12-05 19:50:07	fosslinux	correct
2018-12-05 19:50:08	~ben	if it's in the webroot then it needs permissions
2018-12-05 19:50:28	fosslinux	jan6: i know, but if the WEBSERVER dosent have permission then its still a 404
2018-12-05 19:50:29	+jan6	IT'S ALL CORRECT
2018-12-05 19:50:33	fosslinux	s/404/403
2018-12-05 19:50:33	sedbot	<fosslinux> jan6: i know, but if the WEBSERVER dosent have permission then its still a 403
2018-12-05 19:50:36	+jan6	THE FONTS ARE ACCESSIBLE
2018-12-05 19:50:37	~ben	WHY ARE WE YELLOING
2018-12-05 19:50:40	arne	hmm can access fonts stylesheet
2018-12-05 19:50:41	arne	https://1000.directory/assets/styles/fonts/stylesheet.css
2018-12-05 19:50:42	~ben	chill jfc
2018-12-05 19:50:44	+jan6	you dumdums
2018-12-05 19:50:57	+jan6	the fonts WOULD work if you specified the correct path
2018-12-05 19:51:39	+jan6	you're just telling that "load whateverfont.woff2 from /" instead of /assets/styles/fonts/
2018-12-05 19:51:59	arne	css is supposed to work with relative paths
2018-12-05 19:52:04	+jan6	it does
2018-12-05 19:52:16	+jan6	meaning you can do just assets/
2018-12-05 19:52:20	fosslinux	^ what arne said
2018-12-05 19:52:27	+jan6	unless you're in a subdir, then you have to ../assets
2018-12-05 19:52:35	fosslinux	so because the stylesheet is in assets/styles/fonts
2018-12-05 19:52:37	arne	and the css is in the fonts folder
2018-12-05 19:52:45	fosslinux	and so are the fonts
2018-12-05 19:52:52	fosslinux	you shouldnt need to use absolute paths
2018-12-05 19:53:00	+jan6	if you do "ls file.txt" then it WILL NOT list texts/file.txt
2018-12-05 19:53:07	+jan6	you dumdums
2018-12-05 19:53:09	fosslinux	no
2018-12-05 19:53:09	TildeBot	no u infinity fosslinux
2018-12-05 19:53:10	fosslinux	it wont
2018-12-05 19:53:10	arne	jan6 WE KNOW PATH BASICS
2018-12-05 19:53:19	fosslinux	^^
2018-12-05 19:53:19	+jan6	YOU DON'T
2018-12-05 19:53:31	fosslinux	do u have an account jan6
2018-12-05 19:53:32	~ben	wow please chill
2018-12-05 19:54:02	fosslinux	so. the webroot is `/usr/share/nginx/html`
2018-12-05 19:54:32	fosslinux	the stylesheet is located at `/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/styles/fonts`
2018-12-05 19:54:39	fosslinux	and so are the damn fonts
2018-12-05 19:54:41	fosslinux	so if i run ls
2018-12-05 19:54:50	fosslinux	i see BOTH the stylesheet AND the fonts
2018-12-05 19:54:55	fosslinux	jan6:
2018-12-05 19:55:03	+jan6	paths are run from browser's perspective
2018-12-05 19:55:12	fosslinux	jesus christ
2018-12-05 19:55:13	fosslinux	i know
2018-12-05 19:55:22	fosslinux	they're in the same directory dumbdum
2018-12-05 19:55:46	fosslinux	the stylesheet and fonts are in the same damn directory
2018-12-05 19:55:48	+jan6	no they're not
2018-12-05 19:55:50	TildeBot	no u infinity jan6
2018-12-05 19:55:53	arne	they are
2018-12-05 19:55:56	+jan6	it doesn't matter
2018-12-05 19:56:22	arne	why
2018-12-05 19:56:35	fosslinux	YES THEY DAMN ARE
2018-12-05 19:56:50	fosslinux	dont kick me for spamming

2018-12-05 19:56:56	+jan6	the browser takes all paths relative to the file IT is viewing, so for index page it's trying to see /font.woff2, if I was in /fonts then it'd try to load /fonts/font.woff2
2018-12-05 19:57:03	arne	OK DONE WHILE I FIX THIS WE WILL HAVE THE OLD CSS
2018-12-05 19:57:11	fosslinux	lol arne
2018-12-05 19:57:17	fosslinux	jan6 is being a dumbdumb
2018-12-05 19:57:25	fosslinux	OH I SEE WHAT U MEAN JAN6
2018-12-05 19:57:26	+jan6	YARR TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT
2018-12-05 19:57:34	fosslinux	i dont think thats the case
2018-12-05 19:57:35	+jan6	no u
2018-12-05 19:57:35	TildeBot	no u infinity jan6
2018-12-05 19:57:42	arne	it used to work
2018-12-05 19:57:44	fosslinux	its been a while since ive done css
2018-12-05 19:57:46	arne	in other websites
2018-12-05 19:57:49	fosslinux	just restore the old one
2018-12-05 19:58:09	arne	i did that
2018-12-05 19:58:55	+jan6	if you ask for "show me / of website" and load css, it takes relative paths relative to the /, if you ask the same page in blog/ then it will take it relative to /blog
2018-12-05 19:59:12	+jan6	all you had to do was add /assets/styles/fonts/ to the font definitions
2018-12-05 19:59:47	~ben	fosslinux: have you heard of a pastebin
2018-12-05 19:59:55	~ben	ls | pb

2018-12-05 20:01:05	arne	ok i leeve
2018-12-05 20:01:07	arne	bye
2018-12-05 20:01:08	arne	ee
2018-12-05 20:01:09	fosslinux	sorry
2018-12-05 20:01:10	fosslinux	ben
2018-12-05 20:01:16	fosslinux	bye arne
2018-12-05 20:01:16	+jan6	bye, google fonts sellout ;P
2018-12-05 20:01:49	~ben	wow what a show
2018-12-05 20:02:03	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-05 20:02:05	fosslinux	that was funny
2018-12-05 20:02:18	+jan6	yeah, all because of a simple misunderstanding of how relative paths worked
2018-12-05 20:03:46	+jan6	all he had to do was sed 's.@font-face:".@font-face:"/assets/styles/fonts/.'
2018-12-05 20:03:56	+jan6	and done
2018-12-05 20:05:41	~ben	since it's relative to the page it's included from right?
2018-12-05 20:06:34	+jan6	relative paths are relative from viewer's perspecitve
2018-12-05 20:07:03	+jan6	he thought that since the css was in fonts' folder, the relative path would be current_directory
2018-12-05 20:07:08	~ben	doesn't hurt to use full paths to the fonts in any case
2018-12-05 20:07:36	+jan6	site-wide things should always be absolute
2018-12-05 20:07:47	~ben	Just In Case
2018-12-05 20:08:30	+jan6	relative stuff's cool if you want to change things depending on directory, such as a different font or layout for the "archived blogs" without bothering to change the files themselves
2018-12-05 20:08:49	+jan6	or such, y'know, relative stuff
2018-12-05 20:10:07	+jan6	if you were to have fonts relative, then you'd need a copy in all of the directories, like /, /blogs/, /articles/, etc

2018-12-05 20:55:21	~ben	yeah, whatever you want to connect with
2018-12-05 20:55:35	jack3	I have Win7 and used putty
2018-12-05 20:55:46	jack3	oooold  version of putty, probably
2018-12-05 20:55:48	+jan6	well, the key thingy is different on windows and unix-based stuffs (linux, mac, bsd)
2018-12-05 20:55:51	+jan6	oof
2018-12-05 20:56:12	~ben	i've not had good luck with putty keys, but if you can generate an openssh key with puttygen, just drop the pubkey in the form
2018-12-05 20:56:15	+jan6	putty keys are a doozie, exporting should be fine, though, just puttygen
2018-12-05 20:56:34	~ben	on windows, i recommend https://gitforwindows.org or https://msys2.github.io
2018-12-05 20:56:36	TildeBot	Git for Windows 
2018-12-05 20:56:56	jack3	ben :  I've used it with keys before.  Just for the heck of it, one time.   I have no recollection HOW I did it, but if I did it once, I guess I can figure it out again.   :)
2018-12-05 20:57:09	+jan6	from what I tried, importing a key into putty is a dam nightmare, but if you generate with putty then exporting is fine, make sure to select the right format tho
2018-12-05 20:57:11	~ben	heh ok; holler if you need help!

2018-12-05 23:58:48	mushmouth	anyways ben ive been enjoying my rgb/bluetooth 2.1 speakers
2018-12-05 23:58:58	mushmouth	i like making them the colour red
2018-12-05 23:59:31	mushmouth	ben: most people don't get my jokes. so don't worry. im just a very silly person :D
2018-12-05 23:59:51	~deepend	ben: not much,, thinking of seeing if my streaming pc I have now will keep up or not lol
2018-12-05 23:59:59	mushmouth	did i link the article about the alcholo ban in australia?

2018-12-06 00:00:56	~ben	oooh nice stream some stuff
2018-12-06 00:01:14	mushmouth	deepend: im down for a deepend stream. don't think i ever heard your voice
2018-12-06 00:01:43	~deepend	i think i will once I am done eating.. dont have a mic solution completely yet.. so still no voice.. maybe in future.. 
2018-12-06 00:02:00	mushmouth	deepend: i would say get a really powerful bluetooth headset
2018-12-06 00:02:19	~ben	bluetooth is worse than wifi lol
2018-12-06 00:02:24	mushmouth	there actually not bad when it comes to streamersx
2018-12-06 00:02:27	mushmouth	streamers*
2018-12-06 00:02:32	~deepend	i has Sennheiser bluetooth headphones
2018-12-06 00:03:20	mushmouth	ben: bluetooth not as bad as some people make it out to be. and this is coming from a vintage/retro person
2018-12-06 00:03:44	~ben	lol you're the one who was hating on wifi the other day
2018-12-06 00:03:55	mushmouth	wifi different
2018-12-06 00:03:59	~deepend	i use bluetooth all the time.. except sometimes on my pcs.. since I dont have a decent bluetooth adapter in my compueters.. 
2018-12-06 00:04:01	mushmouth	bluetooth fine by my books
2018-12-06 00:04:06	~ben	it's definitely more reliable than bluetooth
2018-12-06 00:04:17	~ben	i still have a couple bluetooth things
2018-12-06 00:04:21	~ben	it's alright
2018-12-06 00:04:28	mushmouth	the amount of dropage and stuff i had with wifi. it's not my ideal
2018-12-06 00:04:32	mushmouth	just from experience
2018-12-06 00:04:52	~ben	sounds like you had some shitty wifi cards
2018-12-06 00:05:00	mushmouth	when i bought my first thinkpad. wifi was not really supported in linux so i had really shitty wifi card support
2018-12-06 00:05:04	~ben	i've had bad luck with bluetooth stuff
2018-12-06 00:05:12	~ben	you might want to give it another try
2018-12-06 00:05:13	~deepend	whats wrong with bluetooth?  audio isn;t as good but never had reliabilty problems? 
2018-12-06 00:05:16	~ben	it's super stable nowadays
2018-12-06 00:06:17	~deepend	best solution is dont buy cheap bluetooth stuff and your generally ok.. bluedio is probably the cheapest brand (cheap chinese brand)  that I would ever buy.
2018-12-06 00:07:18	mushmouth	i have a skull candy bluetooth headphone and it's not bad either
2018-12-06 00:07:32	mushmouth	the speakers i have are pretty good with bluetooth paired
2018-12-06 00:10:18	~deepend	never had good luck with skull candy.. but everyone probably has different experiences :D 
2018-12-06 00:11:07	~ben	it's a lot of anecdotal evidence
2018-12-06 00:11:12	~deepend	I've apparently only played 36% of the games in my steam library lol sad
2018-12-06 00:11:16	~ben	lol
2018-12-06 00:12:16	~deepend	bluedio is good on battery life, bluetooth connectivety.. but only ok for sound quality..

2018-12-06 00:26:57	xvetrd	aye. im trying to shift into using cwm, instead of spectrwm. for reasons(?)
2018-12-06 00:27:12	xvetrd	but i have my alt key mapped to tmux things, and weechat as well
2018-12-06 00:27:34	xvetrd	and the alt key is cwm's bread and butter apparently
2018-12-06 00:27:48	~ben	is that another tiling wm?
2018-12-06 00:28:02	xvetrd	nope, floating. but is in base for OpenBSD
2018-12-06 00:28:07	~ben	ahh ok
2018-12-06 00:28:38	xvetrd	hot take: i don't like it. it doesnt have alternate screens. works on the basis of hiding and unhiding

2018-12-06 00:30:30	xvetrd	though i never tried i3
2018-12-06 00:31:11	~ben	i should probably try swaywm

2018-12-06 00:40:09	~ben	desktop is beast? or something
2018-12-06 00:40:45	xvetrd	speaking of, i never actually figured out how local DNS works, so those names are largely useless and I have to manually edit my /etc/hosts file every time

2018-12-06 00:41:45	~ben	i have a pi-hole setup on my pi

2018-12-06 00:44:47	~ben	totally worth it
2018-12-06 00:44:51	~ben	doesn't have to be a pi either
2018-12-06 00:45:01	~ben	it can be any box that you leave on 24/7
2018-12-06 00:45:49	xvetrd	well i have two pis, but one is currently set aside after a powersurge. i might move that to next to my router

2018-12-06 00:49:59	stompy	josef stalin killed more ukranians alone than hitler killed jews
2018-12-06 00:50:01	stompy	he was not a man to admire
2018-12-06 00:50:06	stompy	its not ironic, its not funny
2018-12-06 00:50:12	stompy	communism is disgusting
2018-12-06 00:50:45	xvetrd	yes to all that, but stalinist communism isn't communism
2018-12-06 00:50:49	stompy	i actually had a talk with a guy earlier
2018-12-06 00:51:01	stompy	who said he was an "anarcho-libertarian"
2018-12-06 00:51:09	stompy	i told him that was a very verbose way of calling himself a retard

2018-12-06 01:00:41	stompy	i think the users suck but i quite like the system
2018-12-06 01:00:54	stompy	i really like the arch user repository
2018-12-06 01:00:59	stompy	and how it streamlines building packages
2018-12-06 01:01:03	stompy	i think its cool as shit
2018-12-06 01:01:11	stompy	kind of reminds me of the ports system under freebsd
2018-12-06 01:01:16	npa	idk, with github building from there works really well

2018-12-06 01:03:29	stompy	but i will agree that arch users are fuckin annoying

2018-12-06 01:04:43	npa	opening blister packaging..?
2018-12-06 01:04:55	stompy	i wouldnt mind vegans if they just ate their damn food and quit acting like theyre better than me for it
2018-12-06 01:05:02	stompy	i dont think you should blame all vegans for some of them being assholes
2018-12-06 01:05:12	robdrake	no, meat npa
2018-12-06 01:05:13	stompy	i know a lot of vegetarians who dont care about that

2018-12-06 01:06:15	npa	lol
2018-12-06 01:06:29	stompy	but i think theres a lot of irony to be found in how vegans use processed chemical blends to emulate foods that are made from dairy or meat
2018-12-06 01:06:59	stompy	i mean, isnt the point to eat naturally
2018-12-06 01:07:04	xvetrd	but not every vegan does that
2018-12-06 01:07:07	stompy	i know
2018-12-06 01:07:11	stompy	but most of them do lol
2018-12-06 01:07:14	npa	idk, makes sense - cuisine has been based off animal products for ages, so you exploit the culinary knowledge and emulate it
2018-12-06 01:07:19	stompy	ive worked in kitchens that had vegan recipes
2018-12-06 01:07:22	xvetrd	and non-dairy things can be for people who are lactose intolerant
2018-12-06 01:07:23	stompy	and its absolutely ridiculous
2018-12-06 01:07:38	stompy	vegan "cheese" is absolutely repulsive to me
2018-12-06 01:07:46	stompy	and i dont think you can call that shit "CHEESE"
2018-12-06 01:07:47	npa	i didn't mind vegan cheese
2018-12-06 01:07:49	stompy	you gotta call it somethin else
2018-12-06 01:07:56	stompy	it didnt even melt right
2018-12-06 01:07:59	npa	makes bangin cheese toasties
2018-12-06 01:08:03	stompy	fuck that
2018-12-06 01:08:08	stompy	give me sharp cheddar and muenster
2018-12-06 01:08:24	npa	i'm lactose intolerant now so i lose either way
2018-12-06 01:08:41	stompy	that sucks
2018-12-06 01:08:46	stompy	i couldnt like like that
2018-12-06 01:08:53	xvetrd	goat milk apparently doesn't have lactose
2018-12-06 01:08:57	xvetrd	for the record
2018-12-06 01:09:03	stompy	goat cheese is amazing
2018-12-06 01:09:04	npa	idk, jhust switched to having black coffee
2018-12-06 01:09:10	xvetrd	its also expensive as fug tho
2018-12-06 01:09:11	stompy	i love goat cheese on pizza
2018-12-06 01:09:14	stompy	yeah
2018-12-06 01:09:24	stompy	i didnt know that about goat milk though
2018-12-06 01:09:27	stompy	being lactose free
2018-12-06 01:09:30	stompy	thats interesting
2018-12-06 01:09:50	npa	oh its not lactose free
2018-12-06 01:09:52	xvetrd	from my anecdotal evidence, my stomach has been much happier
2018-12-06 01:09:53	npa	just less lactose
2018-12-06 01:10:02	xvetrd	ah
2018-12-06 01:10:14	xvetrd	its some kind of different. i haven't looked into it as much as I should
2018-12-06 01:10:26	robdrake	vanilla soy milk is good for coffee
2018-12-06 01:10:29	npa	i like soy milk sometimes though
2018-12-06 01:10:39	stompy	i used to work at a pizza place that made a killer white pie, we used mozz, parm, goat, romano, ricotta, and tiny bit of cottage cheese
2018-12-06 01:10:44	npa	can't drink almond milk, because lol nut allergy
2018-12-06 01:10:52	xvetrd	dag npa
2018-12-06 01:11:00	stompy	olive oil instead of marinara to coat the crust
2018-12-06 01:11:04	stompy	it was pretty good
2018-12-06 01:11:11	stompy	fresh basil and oregano on top when it came outta the oven

2018-12-06 01:11:28	npa	is that a thing
2018-12-06 01:11:36	xvetrd	i think he means instead of sauce
2018-12-06 01:11:36	stompy	not the crust
2018-12-06 01:11:41	stompy	lol yes
2018-12-06 01:11:58	stompy	when you make a pie you put the sauce first then the toppings
2018-12-06 01:12:02	npa	okay good
2018-12-06 01:12:03	stompy	unless youre doing chicago style
2018-12-06 01:12:13	npa	never had deep dish
2018-12-06 01:12:23	npa	calling pizza a pie is wack
2018-12-06 01:12:24	stompy	its good
2018-12-06 01:12:28	stompy	but its more like a lasagna
2018-12-06 01:12:38	xvetrd	lasagna has layers
2018-12-06 01:12:39	stompy	pizza snobs are the worst people

2018-12-06 01:13:56	stompy	but i prefer my pizza covered in meat and peppers 
2018-12-06 01:13:59	npa	florence isn't pizza town

2018-12-06 01:14:53	TildeBot	no u infinity stompy
2018-12-06 01:15:25	stompy	their pizza isnt very good, but you can hit any little ceasers about 30 minutes after they close, go into the dumpster, and score from 2-20 pies for free, still warm, and in the box
2018-12-06 01:15:42	stompy	i'd take em home, add my own toppings, throw em in the oven for a few minutes and have my own free pizza party
2018-12-06 01:16:06	robdrake	lol
2018-12-06 01:16:07	stompy	they throw them away in the box, its not like you have garbage juice leaking on them, theyre fine
2018-12-06 01:18:08	stompy	i dont wanna say too much about myself but i learned how to survive in extreme poverty
2018-12-06 01:18:16	stompy	people are entirely too fussy about their food 
2018-12-06 01:18:19	stompy	its silly
2018-12-06 01:18:24	stompy	as long as its clean and safe to eat, who cares
2018-12-06 01:18:28	npa	dumpster diving is pretty good
2018-12-06 01:18:40	npa	bread is easy to get because they keep it in bread racks
2018-12-06 01:19:03	stompy	i have been homeless a few times in my life unfortunately and i learned a lot of things about getting free food
2018-12-06 01:19:26	stompy	its really really hard to starve in america if you have any ambition at all
2018-12-06 01:19:32	stompy	there is food to be gleaned from anywhere
2018-12-06 01:19:47	stompy	if you dont want to find it in the garbage, you can find places that will give it to you
2018-12-06 01:20:25	stompy	for as much as we have in this country, no one should ever go hungry
2018-12-06 01:20:32	stompy	we could feed several nations with the food we throw away daily

2018-12-06 05:21:59	ahriman	oh cool, the web interface for transmission is awesome
2018-12-06 05:22:05	ahriman	it's pretty easy to set up
2018-12-06 05:22:10	ahriman	and daemonize
2018-12-06 05:22:24	~ben	nice
2018-12-06 05:22:32	~ben	i need to figure out the external web stuff
2018-12-06 05:22:42	~ben	cause i have everything forwarded to the pi currently
2018-12-06 05:23:01	~ben	might just do the proxy stuff in nginx on the pi?
2018-12-06 05:23:04	~ben	idk
2018-12-06 05:24:06	ahriman	you gonna do wan access to transmission?
2018-12-06 05:24:27	~ben	at least http auth
2018-12-06 05:24:29	~ben	maybe?
2018-12-06 05:24:33	~ben	idk i haven't decided
2018-12-06 05:24:43	ahriman	cool! easy to add stuff while you're at work then
2018-12-06 05:25:03	~ben	lol right
2018-12-06 05:25:39	ahriman	i'd do an ssh tunnel mapped to 9091 like how i connect to town from my vps, but nginx can work too with authentication set up
2018-12-06 05:25:57	ahriman	(9091 is the t-web port)
2018-12-06 05:26:19	ahriman	oh if youre at work thats probably no good
2018-12-06 05:26:38	ahriman	i cant imagine an ssh tunnel will go over well with t3/corp support
2018-12-06 05:26:53	ahriman	yeah nginx is better in that scenario
2018-12-06 05:27:02	~ben	yeah i can only get port 22

2018-12-06 06:16:12	ahriman	lol
2018-12-06 06:16:42	ahriman	since we have so many people in this house we get together once a week and clean the common areas together

2018-12-06 06:30:02	fosslinux	yeah lol
2018-12-06 06:30:11	~deepend	the record player and cd player go through the amp which goes to an input on my sound card... the mic goes directly to sound card.. and then I use the voice meeter banana to bring it all together
2018-12-06 06:30:41	fosslinux	what connection?
2018-12-06 06:30:43	fosslinux	xlr?

2018-12-06 06:33:27	fosslinux	eee thats bad
2018-12-06 06:33:39	~deepend	yea.. but I am able to hide the noise I think

2018-12-06 16:09:57	robdrake	if anyone wants to help with the trivia game, issue a pull request from https://tildegit.org/rgdrake/nodeircbot

2018-12-06 16:10:39	+jan6|	I don't do news
2018-12-06 16:10:43	robdrake	not yet, it'd be a separate bot from the trivia bot
2018-12-06 16:11:11	robdrake	which is more important people, trivia or drinking?
2018-12-06 16:11:20	+jan6|	neither
2018-12-06 16:11:27	+jan6|	it's sleeping
2018-12-06 16:11:30	~ben	?
2018-12-06 16:11:34	kirch	drinking and trivia go together so well tho

2018-12-06 16:11:47	kirch	oooh - not drinking drinking but like hydration drinking - nvm
2018-12-06 16:11:57	~ben	or both?

2018-12-06 16:12:09	~ben	drinking drinking and hydration drinking
2018-12-06 16:12:15	+jan6|	@bus right now
2018-12-06 16:12:22	robdrake	it's hydration drinking afaik
2018-12-06 16:12:40	+jan6|	hydration drinking IS hydration drinking, lol
2018-12-06 16:12:57	+jan6|	alcohol drinking isn't drinking drinking
2018-12-06 16:13:38	mushmouth	ben i personally don't get the re thing. i'd rather tag someone
2018-12-06 16:13:53	~ben	?
2018-12-06 16:14:00	+jan6|	??
2018-12-06 16:14:11	~ben	i don't really like getting tagged for irrelevant stuff
2018-12-06 16:14:45	~ben	what's not to get with re
2018-12-06 16:14:53	+jan6|	tags are for when you want the person to direct attention to the thing
2018-12-06 16:15:12	+jan6|	and ben already has tons of things to take care of
2018-12-06 16:15:23	~ben	re: re: it's just a way to give context to something you're saying
2018-12-06 16:15:34	~ben	you could use w/r/t if you prefer

2018-12-06 16:16:21	~ben	still not helpful imo

2018-12-06 16:19:49	+jan6|	face of a swan, back of a swan, or side of a swan?
2018-12-06 16:19:53	~ben	yeah that's what i'd think
2018-12-06 16:20:06	+jan6|	it says axis, but not side
2018-12-06 16:20:12	kirch	left of a swan, right of a human(?)
2018-12-06 16:20:17	cdmnky	just read the news, and apparently one of the busses from my old high school crashed into a deer by my house after I went in this morning lol
2018-12-06 16:20:33	+jan6|	went in where?
2018-12-06 16:20:41	~ben	did the bus hit the deer or did the deer hit the bus
2018-12-06 16:21:00	+jan6|	did you go in the house and not notice that
2018-12-06 16:21:17	~ben	what do you mean in the house
2018-12-06 16:21:22	cdmnky	probably the deer ran into it, the driver side bumper was dented

2018-12-06 16:22:15	+jan6|	and the bus

2018-12-06 16:22:42	cdmnky	nah, 1 or 2 buses crash every year there
2018-12-06 16:22:45	~ben	a bus isn't someone
2018-12-06 16:22:50	+jan6|	it sure is
2018-12-06 16:22:59	~ben	lol no
2018-12-06 16:23:20	cdmnky	best one was when one bus driver started accelerating and rear-ending a bus in front of them that was in park, while someone was stepping off

2018-12-06 16:24:25	kirch	when a mommy bus and a daddy bus love eachother very much, they sometimes make a VW Microbus
2018-12-06 16:24:26	+jan6|	wtf is wrong with the world
2018-12-06 16:24:38	~ben	lol kirch nice one
2018-12-06 16:25:14	~ben	also #counting is a thing 
2018-12-06 16:25:17	~ben	and it's in binary
2018-12-06 16:25:18	kirch	I'd assume the gestation period for a bus would be on-par with an elephant
2018-12-06 16:25:31	~ben	if not longer
2018-12-06 16:26:24	kirch	it's like 2 years, IIRC

2018-12-06 16:27:53	+jan6|	#counting is in binary cause I insisted it to not be normal ;p
2018-12-06 16:28:17	~ben	tbh we could do any base
2018-12-06 16:29:10	cdmnky	nah, we got to make a #ipv32 and increment through all the possible ip addresses in base number of unicode characters
2018-12-06 16:29:25	cdmnky	based on aewens 's blog thing
2018-12-06 16:30:57	~ben	oh boy
2018-12-06 16:31:14	~ben	there's no way to represent an ipv32 address within an irc message
2018-12-06 16:31:50	cdmnky	i found it interesting. since there's more ipv32 addresses than atoms in the universe, we'd run out of space for them before running out addresses themselves
2018-12-06 16:32:48	~ben	maaaaany orders of magnitude more
2018-12-06 16:33:39	cdmnky	i guess the only good reason for emojis is to create an arbitrary base that can hold one in exactly 1GB
2018-12-06 16:34:38	cdmnky	welp, gonna get lunch

2018-12-06 16:41:56	robdrake	well, as far as more ipv32 address than atoms in the universe, doesn't count unproven dark matter
2018-12-06 16:42:50	robdrake	and speaking of lunch, I need to see what is on the menu
2018-12-06 16:46:37	+jan6|	yeah, atoms in the VISIBLE universe
2018-12-06 16:47:28	+jan6|	also dark matter might very well not even have that many atoms
2018-12-06 16:50:09	robdrake	or some unknown matter
2018-12-06 16:57:48	+jan6|	it definitely is unknown, lok
2018-12-06 16:58:47	kirch	if star-trek taught me anything it's that the anti-dimension is near, and if we make a magnetic bridge we can get there - but if we go it might make us insane enough to try to kill our anti-matter counterpart, which would destroy both our dimensions
2018-12-06 17:00:11	~ben	probably for the best
2018-12-06 17:07:18	+aewens	#ipv32 when?

2018-12-06 18:29:15	+aewens	Is it though? Most people are concentrated in small regions, so it's fairly likely to have two people from the same big city.
2018-12-06 18:30:21	~khuxkm|lounge	I'm not from Buffalo
2018-12-06 18:30:44	+aewens	Same thing with the birthday paradox where there's greater than a 50% change of two people sharing the same birthday with a group of 24 people
2018-12-06 18:30:48	~khuxkm|lounge	the ortho clinic is just so much cheaper than ortho where I live that it's worth the 1 and 1/2 hour drive

2018-12-06 18:44:26	bastiaan	is there a way that I can still save the irc log when I am offline?
2018-12-06 18:45:44	~khuxkm|lounge	bastiaan: run your chat program in screen/tmux/byobu? use TheLounge?
2018-12-06 18:46:02	bastiaan	I am using web.tilde.chat right now
2018-12-06 18:46:22	bastiaan	but if I refresh it the log is gone, at least the last time
2018-12-06 18:46:27	bastiaan	I have registered my username now
2018-12-06 18:46:30	cdmnky	ham radio sounds fun, expensive but fun
2018-12-06 18:46:41	bastiaan	if i log in again now, is the log still there?
2018-12-06 18:47:24	~khuxkm|lounge	bastiaan: log into ~team and run "webirc"
2018-12-06 18:47:40	~khuxkm|lounge	supply a password and use your username/password combo to log into irc.tilde.team
2018-12-06 18:47:55	~khuxkm|lounge	I use it as my bouncer and phone IRC client
2018-12-06 18:48:08	kirch	cdmnky: I've been looking into it - you can get a small working radio for under $100
2018-12-06 18:48:17	bastiaan	ahh thank you I will try it
2018-12-06 18:48:30	bastiaan	khuxkm|lounge
2018-12-06 18:48:50	cdmnky	kirch yeah, but in the US it's illegal to transmit without a license, and that requires courses and certs, and provisioning a callsign from the FCC
2018-12-06 18:48:59	~khuxkm|lounge	so in other news, my Hacktoberfest 2018 shirt finally shipped
2018-12-06 18:49:16	~khuxkm|lounge	cdmnky: it requires taking a basic tech exam
2018-12-06 18:49:49	cdmnky	i thought it also meant learning morse code and jargon type stuff?
2018-12-06 18:49:51	~khuxkm|lounge	if you pass the test (and you can take it over and over again until you pass) you get a certificate that will eventually be honored and you get your full-time callsign
2018-12-06 18:49:56	~khuxkm|lounge	morse code used to be a requirement
2018-12-06 18:50:03	kirch	I don't think you need morse anymore
2018-12-06 18:50:03	~khuxkm|lounge	key word being "used to"
2018-12-06 18:50:11	~khuxkm|lounge	and the jargon is piss easy
2018-12-06 18:50:16	~khuxkm|lounge	it's "this equals that"
2018-12-06 18:50:39	~khuxkm|lounge	"QRZ = Who's calling me?" "CQ = Calling all stations" etc.
2018-12-06 18:50:49	cdmnky	technical stuff is like Ohm's law and radio bands and stuff like that?
2018-12-06 18:50:51	~khuxkm|lounge	join #hamradio if you wanna talk more about it
2018-12-06 18:50:56	~khuxkm|lounge	i think so

2018-12-06 19:28:26	jack3	it takes a while to move around files that big, for me.   :)
2018-12-06 19:28:27	~ben	np

2018-12-06 19:29:35	jack3	jan6:  I used to have some players, that would go through withdrawal, if the bot or shell went down.  hehehe
2018-12-06 19:30:04	jack3	~ben> rsync or scp  :   where it is now,  I don't know if that shell has servers for that.
2018-12-06 19:30:36	+jan6	pretty sure you don't need anything special for scp
2018-12-06 19:30:42	+jan6	sshfs as well
2018-12-06 19:31:25	+jan6	rsync I've not used personally so not exactly sure about that, I know it can transfer over ssh, but not if it needs a reciever thingy like mosh

2018-12-06 19:34:22	~ben	rsync doesn't need anything more than ssh access

2018-12-06 20:30:53	+mspe	there's also lots of 32bit libs for wine
2018-12-06 20:31:30	+mspe	qemu has also a lot of libs for all virtual architectures
2018-12-06 20:31:47	~ben	so it's not really a base install
2018-12-06 20:32:05	~ben	not even close
2018-12-06 20:32:30	+mspe	that's why I'm surprised such a bloated install is still way thinner than basic win+office
2018-12-06 20:33:05	~ben	heh i'm no longer surprised by how bad windows is
2018-12-06 20:33:54	+mspe	I'm curious to see what size will be basic win+office with windows 10 and office 2016
2018-12-06 20:34:11	+mspe	compared to my old vm windows 7 with office 2013
2018-12-06 20:35:02	~ben	good question tbh
2018-12-06 20:35:06	~ben	i'm curious as well
2018-12-06 20:37:09	+mspe	I only use my windows vm to export to pdf some modified docx files from people, and follow my remote classes cause I don't want to pollute my debian with flash since these suckers use adobe connect!
2018-12-06 20:37:55	+mspe	what a waste of disk space!
2018-12-06 20:39:00	+mspe	speaking of which, I recently realized that the antivirus they use at work is even more bloated than a microsoft product

2018-12-06 20:41:18	~ben	i keep windows for dualboot on my pc for games
2018-12-06 20:41:31	~ben	haven't bothered to set up gpu passthrough for qemu or anything
2018-12-06 20:41:50	+jan6	I did use dualboot till I had to get a new drive
2018-12-06 20:42:32	+mspe	I'm getting older, nowadays I get more fun just coding than gaming ^^
2018-12-06 20:42:43	+jan6	now I'm officially windows-free
2018-12-06 20:42:58	+jan6	heh, mspe why not combine the two ;P
2018-12-06 20:43:32	+mspe	I'd only commit to that for a really rally nice game idea
2018-12-06 20:43:40	+jan6	elevator game, and https://screeps.io and the obvious way of making your own
2018-12-06 20:43:46	~ben	mspe: have you been doing AoC?

2018-12-06 20:46:03	~ben	i wouldn't say it's a riddle
2018-12-06 20:48:27	 *	jan6 just got to reading that Australia Breaks The Internet story lined some hours ago
2018-12-06 20:49:01	+jan6	lol @ "The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only laws that apply in Australia is the law of Australia,", this is around trump level, I'd say
2018-12-06 20:50:00	+mspe	I'm more curious about France Breaks The Government
2018-12-06 20:50:05	+mspe	:P
2018-12-06 20:50:14	~ben	more immediately relevant for you i'm sure
2018-12-06 20:50:15	+aewens	mspe: If you enjoy coding, then take up AoC. Otherwise, you probably wouldn't enjoy it.
2018-12-06 20:50:15	+jan6	basically, if they were to pass the law, I bet everyone would just block Aus and be done with it
2018-12-06 20:50:38	+aewens	And what is Australia doing this time?
2018-12-06 20:50:43	+jan6	if you enjoy planning and stuff, look at elevator game or screeps.io or such stuff

2018-12-06 20:50:55	+jan6	just the same link
2018-12-06 20:51:27	+jan6	the trick is to use opensource apps and add your own custom security on top of it ;P
2018-12-06 20:51:41	~ben	rule #1: don't roll your own crypto
2018-12-06 20:51:49	+jan6	you're adding it
2018-12-06 20:52:18	+jan6	1. use already done secure crypto 2. wrap it in your own 3. boom, it's more secure
2018-12-06 20:52:30	~ben	don't forget rule #2
2018-12-06 20:52:40	~ben	rule #2: don't roll your own crypto
2018-12-06 20:52:56	+aewens	appendix on rule #1: hackers assume you aren't using your own crypto, so their attacks target existing crypto. Do with this what you will.
2018-12-06 20:53:14	+jan6	but rule #0 says "if you can read this, ignore the following rules"
2018-12-06 20:53:27	+jan6	exactly, aewens 
2018-12-06 20:53:43	+mspe	it's simple: code transparency, keys secrecy
2018-12-06 20:54:07	+jan6	just pgp encrypt the message, reverse, xor with public key, and send
2018-12-06 20:54:47	+jan6	it relies MAINLY on pgp, but first you have to figure out the other stuff
2018-12-06 20:55:27	+aewens	At the very least, it slows them down since they need to figure out that you're doing the reverse + xor thing
2018-12-06 20:55:52	+jan6	this is just a simple sample, it could be much deeper, and if you program it in, it'll be invisible to end users
2018-12-06 20:55:54	+jan6	^exactly
2018-12-06 20:56:31	+jan6	you're not relying on your own crypto, you're just confusing them into not recognizing the real lock
2018-12-06 21:00:34	+jan6	the simple example is nothing, it's real easy to add a ton of text ciphers, then encrypt, base64, compress, filter a little, and reverse + blend with an already shared secret
2018-12-06 21:00:59	+jan6	then encrypt again just in case
2018-12-06 21:01:34	+aewens	You forgot to salt it. Now it's insecure and tastes bland.
2018-12-06 21:01:43	+jan6	paranoid and great increase in size? sure! but it WILL keep them at bay for a lot longer, "you never asked for my seond key, HAH"
2018-12-06 21:01:53	+jan6	salt and pepper it, too, sure
2018-12-06 21:02:33	+aewens	If your code isn't using a nonce, why are you even cryptoing to begin with?
2018-12-06 21:03:56	+jan6	just reverse and xor 100 times with pgp encryption between each stage, then compress, reverse, repeat, and embed it into a .docx macro
2018-12-06 21:04:23	+jan6	they'll never suspect the 2gb word file!
2018-12-06 21:08:09	+jan6	hmm, crypto pepper is something I forgot existed and never knew much about, but it seems pretty cool!
2018-12-06 21:11:51	+jan6	basically salt + pepper > encryption, it seems, until you get the pepper, you can't get a single secret_thing, and even once you get it, you have to still deal with the salt of each and every secret_thing, unlike regular crypto where know the key = instant access to everything
2018-12-06 21:12:13	+jan6	obviously it's best to combine stuff
2018-12-06 21:14:17	%ubergeek	One thing I noted with new insallers:  once partitioning is done, it starts copying files in the background while you finish going through it
2018-12-06 21:14:30	+jan6	speeds it up ;P
2018-12-06 21:14:36	%ubergeek	(New linux installer)
2018-12-06 21:14:44	+jan6	what OS?
2018-12-06 21:15:10	%ubergeek	So far, Ubuntu and dervis do, and Manjaro does.

2018-12-06 21:29:23	+mspe	will I now dare to install the 3 gig antivirus? ^^
2018-12-06 21:30:29	~ben	lol
2018-12-06 21:30:31	~ben	i mean
2018-12-06 21:30:37	~ben	sure
2018-12-06 21:31:48	+mspe	not for fun, I just wanna be able to prescan things in this new VM on my personal debian
2018-12-06 21:31:58	+mspe	to avoid any false positive report from my windows workstation at work
2018-12-06 21:35:45	~ben	fair enough :P
2018-12-06 21:36:06	+mspe	even if the size of the program is a scandal :D
2018-12-06 21:39:38	~ben	yeah tht'at almost texlive size
2018-12-06 21:42:54	login	what is texlive size?
2018-12-06 21:43:08	login	not getting a sense of scale

2018-12-06 21:46:38	+jan6	hmm
2018-12-06 21:47:08	+mspe	only texlive-xetex and texlive-lang-neglish are really useful

2018-12-06 21:59:36	giacomo	good evening
2018-12-06 22:00:43	<--	morsecodemedia (morsecodeme@12.226.121.10) has quit (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
2018-12-06 22:05:23	giacomo	ben: is it possible for a person without a mail to get an account in tilde.team?
2018-12-06 22:05:38	giacomo	I mean without an email
2018-12-06 22:05:40	login	That is a very good question.
2018-12-06 22:06:03	login	Would they accept grr.la emails?
2018-12-06 22:06:26	giacomo	thanks login... this is one of the best compliment for me...
2018-12-06 22:07:54	+jan6	well, why not?
2018-12-06 22:08:31	+jan6	grr.la is pretty cool for "ad hoc mailing" or such
2018-12-06 22:08:34	giacomo	jan6: there could be several reason... some even legal ones...
2018-12-06 22:09:08	+jan6	it actually saves your messages and stuff, don't remember if you can make private boxes too, but I think you can
2018-12-06 22:09:54	+jan6	and gorillamail also allows SENDING mail, which basically nobody else does
2018-12-06 22:10:00	giacomo	no... I'm asking if it would be possible WITHOUT any email... that is using the mail service here as one first mail address
2018-12-06 22:10:36	+jan6	well, if you don't have a valid reason, probably not?
2018-12-06 22:10:50	+jan6	I guess technically any way to contact you should work
2018-12-06 22:11:07	+jan6	but what reason would be to not use ANY mail?
2018-12-06 22:12:08	~ben	giacomo: yeah it's possible
2018-12-06 22:12:15	+jan6	technically everything's possible I guess, as long as you manage to talk ben into doing it ;P
2018-12-06 22:12:20	~ben	why though
2018-12-06 22:12:22	+jan6	^
2018-12-06 22:12:42	~ben	i mean the only reason i need a mail address is to let them know about their new account and that they can log in now
2018-12-06 22:12:53	giacomo	because I'm a kid and I have been strongly discouraged to use online web mails
2018-12-06 22:13:07	+jan6	then don't use WEB mails, dummy ;P
2018-12-06 22:13:15	giacomo	ok
2018-12-06 22:13:24	giacomo	this is a good point actually
2018-12-06 22:13:28	~ben	you already have an account though
2018-12-06 22:13:30	giacomo	let me reformulate
2018-12-06 22:13:32	~ben	is this for someone else?
2018-12-06 22:13:39	giacomo	it's not for me obviously
2018-12-06 22:14:02	~ben	you could just have them send the mail to your account and you can let them know that it's created
2018-12-06 22:14:20	giacomo	I'm thinking about the class I'm teaching few lesson of informatics
2018-12-06 22:14:21	+jan6	you can even setup a local mail server and a dyndns subdomain, I guess, lol
2018-12-06 22:15:00	+jan6	(though need to make sure your isp allows hosting on your connection, and stuff, I guess)
2018-12-06 22:15:03	giacomo	this would be to trick ben which might want to have somebody to blame if the shutdown the server :-D
2018-12-06 22:15:31	+jan6	?
2018-12-06 22:15:41	~ben	huh?
2018-12-06 22:15:43	giacomo	I'm giving a few lessons to a class of 10yo kids
2018-12-06 22:16:03	+jan6	don't bring them on here, lol
2018-12-06 22:16:11	giacomo	on January I will talk about Internet Protocol and so on
2018-12-06 22:16:44	+jan6	madlad
2018-12-06 22:17:06	giacomo	jan6: ok... that was what I wanted to know actually... I thought the problem would be the email... but actually yes.. age is a thing too :-)
2018-12-06 22:18:04	giacomo	I think I should setup a local tilde for kids where I give them an account for free until they grow older
2018-12-06 22:18:15	+jan6	^
2018-12-06 22:18:24	~ben	a raspberry pi would definitely suffice
2018-12-06 22:18:32	+jan6	then ask their fee to continue using it, muhahaha
2018-12-06 22:18:33	~ben	i mean i'm not opposed if they're able to behave
2018-12-06 22:18:54	+jan6	I don't think they'll fit well
2018-12-06 22:19:42	+jan6	even if they don't break anything, which would be ideal
2018-12-06 22:20:20	giacomo	ben: they are kids... they don't know how to behave... they wouldn't be able to use weechat or mutt... they would need to have everything teached... it's unlikely they would break anything... except their own home dir :-)
2018-12-06 22:20:25	+jan6	(y'know, webirc was broken just by piping stuff into it, and "wall" command is avalable, soo)
2018-12-06 22:20:41	+jan6	just keep them in a container
2018-12-06 22:20:42	giacomo	I see the effect right now
2018-12-06 22:21:15	giacomo	and I guess y0x3y@tilde is not a kid :-)
2018-12-06 22:21:41	~ben	huh?
2018-12-06 22:21:49	 *	jan6 prefers less inactive users, so personally would not see a reason not to host a tiny tilde just for learning using some real cheap vps
2018-12-06 22:21:53	giacomo	he sent a wall message
2018-12-06 22:22:09	+jan6	he be sm4rt, liek meh!
2018-12-06 22:22:16	~ben	it's fine as long as you don't abuse it
2018-12-06 22:22:52	giacomo	I think jan6 is right though
2018-12-06 22:22:53	+jan6	the moment somebody tells others how to use "wall"
2018-12-06 22:22:55	+jan6	....

2018-12-06 22:32:52	~ben	2.49 eur is pretty close to free

2018-12-07 00:31:24	%ubergeek	If I were to offer advice:  Don't write a license in your non-primary language. Let lawyers do the translating.
2018-12-07 00:31:52	%ubergeek	You're going to need legal review in all of the 5 eyes nations anyways, for it to be considered valid for use anyways
2018-12-07 00:32:06	giacomo	login: telling me to not write a license is a bit obvious... 50% of the mails I got in the last 3 days say this...
2018-12-07 00:32:21	%ubergeek	There might be something to that advice, just sayin
2018-12-07 00:32:44	%ubergeek	Its one of those "I'm not crazy, everyone else is!" :P
2018-12-07 00:32:46	giacomo	the other 50% are suggestions for improvements
2018-12-07 00:32:52	login	I mean, you can write it... but don't use it for intellectual properly that is serious.

2018-12-07 00:33:12	login	Especially if someone can use it, hurt themselves, then claim liability from you...
2018-12-07 00:33:18	%ubergeek	I mean, I will never use your license until lawyers have reviewed it, minimally
2018-12-07 00:33:49	login	And if the license is not properly written, then it'll be hard to argue in court (if someone takes it to court)... and you'll lose legal fees...
2018-12-07 00:34:10	giacomo	trust me they are reviewing it... pretty carefully...
2018-12-07 00:34:11	login	Even putting things into the public domain requires a CC0 license lol
2018-12-07 00:34:24	%ubergeek	What law firm is reviewing it?
2018-12-07 00:34:38	login	The law is larger than any program... I wonder how there aren't "hackers" in the field of law...
2018-12-07 00:34:58	%ubergeek	And what jurisdiction are they licensed to practice law in?

2018-12-07 00:36:01	giacomo	no you misread me... I got a review from an Italian lawyer of a previous version, and to him it look crazy but "as valid as the others mainstream licenses"

2018-12-07 00:36:22	giacomo	why TildeBot always say "no u..."?
2018-12-07 00:36:24	TildeBot	giacomo, Wtf r u talkin bout.
2018-12-07 00:36:32	%ubergeek	If that firm is willing to offer an official legal opinion on it, then it's valid for Italy.

2018-12-07 00:36:43	%ubergeek	I do notthink it'd be honored in the US, wholly.
2018-12-07 00:36:51	mushmouth	this attempt it jus weird and silly to me
2018-12-07 00:36:57	mushmouth	mainfesto would make more sene
2018-12-07 00:37:11	%ubergeek	Parts might be upheld, but largely, it's non-enforceable, in my non-lawyer-opinion
2018-12-07 00:37:22	giacomo	ubergeek: why?
2018-12-07 00:37:39	mushmouth	giacomo: do you want me to talk to one of my lawyer friends in america and tell you how hard it's going to be to make a license like that?
2018-12-07 00:37:48	mushmouth	or my lawyer geek friends
2018-12-07 00:37:53	%ubergeek	For example, in contract law, both parties must get "something" for each clause.  A number of clauses are one-sided, and thus, non enforceable.  IANAL
2018-12-07 00:38:15	mushmouth	giacomo: link me to the license and i can give you a real life example at least for america and his state
2018-12-07 00:38:41	giacomo	in which case my software wont be usable in the US
2018-12-07 00:38:49	%ubergeek	It's usable.
2018-12-07 00:39:17	%ubergeek	Just, public domain, for all intents and purposes.
2018-12-07 00:39:22	giacomo	mushmouth: http://www.tesio.it/documents/HACK.txt
2018-12-07 00:39:36	giacomo	code is not public domain by default
2018-12-07 00:39:43	%ubergeek	Especially, more so, if there on non-severability clauses, which makes the entire license unenforceable, if any clause is found as such
2018-12-07 00:39:49	giacomo	code is all right reserved
2018-12-07 00:39:56	%ubergeek	You're in Italy, so standard copyright law applies in the US to it
2018-12-07 00:39:57	giacomo	by default
2018-12-07 00:40:23	%ubergeek	And, since it would require YOU to show up in court in the US to enforce a copyright claim...  Basically, public domain.
2018-12-07 00:40:45	%ubergeek	And if you fail to protect your copyright early on, it's presumed to be public domain in the US.
2018-12-07 00:40:55	%ubergeek	IANAL

2018-12-07 00:41:07	giacomo	ubergeek: you didn't read it, right?
2018-12-07 00:41:38	%ubergeek	I read it when you posted it to debian-legal...
2018-12-07 00:41:47	%ubergeek	Like I said, I sub to that mail list
2018-12-07 00:42:13	%ubergeek	Again, my non-lawyer opinion, of course...
2018-12-07 00:42:27	giacomo	it contains an non-exclusive copyright assignment upstream
2018-12-07 00:42:34	mushmouth	giacomo: im talking to some of my lawyer/lawyer geek friends. i can give you some sort of understanding what your trying to achieve
2018-12-07 00:42:54	giacomo	mushmouth: thanks :-)
2018-12-07 00:42:56	%ubergeek	giacomo: that is one of the "non-enforceable" clauses here... It's one-sided.
2018-12-07 00:43:07	%ubergeek	The licensee gets nothing in return for it.

2018-12-07 00:43:46	%ubergeek	Again:  I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.  Should you need legal advice, you should consult a licensed attorney in the applicable jurisdiction.
2018-12-07 00:44:13	giacomo	ubergeek: I understood and recognise that you are not a lawyer :-)
2018-12-07 00:44:18	%ubergeek	tomasino: did you get my messsage about aeon project?
2018-12-07 00:44:56	%ubergeek	giacomo: that's a standard thing to say after giving a non-lawyer opinion in the US.  Otherwise, you could be found to be practicing law without a license :)
2018-12-07 00:45:18	mushmouth	giacomo: do you know the history of gay rights and legalizing weed?

2018-12-07 01:21:27	%ubergeek	The wisdom is to know when it is.  In this case, without a team of international copyright lawyers, writing this on your own is a "Bad Idea(tm)"
2018-12-07 01:21:44	giacomo	why?
2018-12-07 01:21:52	%ubergeek	If I have to give ownership to someone else, I no longer have the freedom to distribute my work, as I see fit
2018-12-07 01:21:59	%ubergeek	The upstream owner has that right

2018-12-07 01:22:31	%ubergeek	"Being free to do these things means (among other things) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission to do so."
2018-12-07 01:22:57	%ubergeek	Since I am no longer the licensor, I not longer am able to do so without asking permission of the licensee, who can choose (Without my input) to relicense
2018-12-07 01:22:59	giacomo	indeed you don't
2018-12-07 01:23:12	%ubergeek	That's not how copyright works
2018-12-07 01:23:27	%ubergeek	The OWNER of the code gets to decide when and how.
2018-12-07 01:23:36	%ubergeek	Your license makes my works automatically, NOT MINE
2018-12-07 01:24:14	%ubergeek	So, in the case of Jehanne, if I were to contribute, my work IS NOT MINE, it IS YOURS, and I now have to ask permission to distribute changes
2018-12-07 01:24:25	%ubergeek	Same as if I had to sign a CLA
2018-12-07 01:24:47	giacomo	ubergeek: when you give EXCLUSIVE copyright to somebody else you have to sign a written contract and you would be right, but NON-EXCLUSIVE don't work this way because they do NOT exclude you 
2018-12-07 01:24:52	%ubergeek	And, I get nothing in return for that, which makes that clause null and void, in most US jurisdictions
2018-12-07 01:25:06	giacomo	that assignment in the Hacking License is NON-EXCLUSIVE
2018-12-07 01:25:13	giacomo	like all others

2018-12-07 01:32:47	giacomo	I mean, I don't want to take for myself
2018-12-07 01:33:06	%ubergeek	So, as I've said (Several times) have an international copyright lawyer review it.  Not debian-legal, #meta, or anyone else yet.

2018-12-07 01:35:34	%ubergeek	Because that just makes the entire thing unenforceable, which is what I've been fucking telling you this whole time.

2018-12-07 01:38:43	giacomo	I've never said it's not intended to be a free license
2018-12-07 01:39:00	giacomo	it IS a free license
2018-12-07 01:39:29	giacomo	I said that I don't want to retain any freedom on the code of other people
2018-12-07 01:39:45	giacomo	with retain meaning to keep for myself

2018-12-07 01:40:34	giacomo	yes we were talking about the copyright assignment

2018-12-07 01:41:46	giacomo	I don't want to keep for myself any freedom of the assigners thus the assignment is NON-EXCLUSIVE 
2018-12-07 01:41:48	%ubergeek	It's highly irritating when (And I know this is a bandwagon appeal) myriad people on myriad locations have told the same individual the same things about the same subject, and the same individual is claiming everyone else is wrong
2018-12-07 01:42:17	%ubergeek	giacomo:  get back to us when a lawyer dealing in international copyright law has reviewed this document.
2018-12-07 01:42:30	giacomo	ehm... ever heard of Galileo :-)
2018-12-07 01:42:45	%ubergeek	Yes, I have.  Ever heard what happened to him?  He died.  On house arrest.
2018-12-07 01:43:11	giacomo	ubergeek: was he wrong?
2018-12-07 01:43:14	%ubergeek	You are no Galileo.

2018-12-07 01:45:15	giacomo	don't think that I like to annoy debian legal (despite I admit that some interesting people contacted me privately saying that the Hacking License is very interesting and suggesting some of the change I did)
2018-12-07 01:45:23	%ubergeek	And apsillers.
2018-12-07 01:45:36	giacomo	let's look

2018-12-07 01:47:05	%ubergeek	There's a project that chose an oddball license.  Note, it's hardly used. Anywhere.
2018-12-07 01:47:26	giacomo	ubergeek: I'm not looking for OSI or FSF approval
2018-12-07 01:47:52	%ubergeek	Well, then you're not looking for anyone to use it
2018-12-07 01:48:04	giacomo	I _hope_ to be able to find a synthesis between the Jehanne needs and Debian values
2018-12-07 01:48:33	%ubergeek	All debian software needs to be FOSS.  Which means it needs a FSF approval on the license.
2018-12-07 01:48:49	giacomo	ubergeek: maybe... it's a Hacking License... a hack is an experiment, it can fail or success
2018-12-07 01:49:00	%ubergeek	As far as Debian is concerned, there is no synthesis in non-FOSS software, and FOSS software
2018-12-07 01:49:02	giacomo	ubergeek: false
2018-12-07 01:49:31	%ubergeek	It's either compliant with a FOSS license, or not.
2018-12-07 01:49:32	giacomo	ubergeek: Debian is autonomous from OSI and FSF
2018-12-07 01:49:35	%ubergeek	There is no gray area.
2018-12-07 01:50:06	giacomo	ubergeek: it's either copliant with DFSG or not

2018-12-07 01:50:26	TildeBot	Debian -- What Does Free Mean?  https://bhh.sh/ej
2018-12-07 01:50:26	giacomo	it can easily be compliant with DFSF and not OSI
2018-12-07 01:50:42	%ubergeek	Yours is compliant with neither.
2018-12-07 01:50:55	%ubergeek	And, I will argue that, as a package maintainer
2018-12-07 01:51:11	giacomo	read last line
2018-12-07 01:51:34	giacomo	Since many different licenses are used on software, a set of guidelines, the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) were developed to come up with a reasonable definition of what constitutes free software. Only software that complies with the DFSG is allowed in the main distribution of Debian. 
2018-12-07 01:51:48	%ubergeek	Yep, read the DFSG
2018-12-07 01:51:56	giacomo	I did
2018-12-07 01:52:40	%ubergeek	You missed some clauses, then...
2018-12-07 01:52:48	giacomo	the Hacking License match each and all of them, passes the tree tests
2018-12-07 01:52:55	giacomo	oh.. finally! which one?
2018-12-07 01:53:03	%ubergeek	The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.
2018-12-07 01:53:19	%ubergeek	The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be free software.
2018-12-07 01:53:21	giacomo	how this is violated?
2018-12-07 01:53:33	giacomo	how this is violated?
2018-12-07 01:53:37	%ubergeek	I'm not going to explai again.
2018-12-07 01:53:43	giacomo	you didn't
2018-12-07 01:53:44	%ubergeek	You do you.  Good luck.
2018-12-07 01:54:04	giacomo	no restriction is posed on the distribution of other software
2018-12-07 01:54:05	TildeBot	no u infinity giacomo
2018-12-07 01:54:32	giacomo	if you can point a line in the Hacking License were such restriction is posed I would be really grateful
2018-12-07 01:54:41	%ubergeek	I already have.
2018-12-07 01:54:53	%ubergeek	Pearls before swine, and all.  Go consult a lawyer.
2018-12-07 01:54:58	giacomo	same for the need of an addictional license/contranct or so...
2018-12-07 01:55:04	%ubergeek	Pearls before swine, and all.  Go consult a lawyer.
2018-12-07 01:55:09	giacomo	you didn't ...

2018-12-07 13:23:30	mushmouth	ssl was a mistake

2018-12-07 13:23:37	+jan6	ssl is great

2018-12-07 13:28:18	+jan6	also why that specifically?
2018-12-07 13:28:28	mushmouth	i feel like they butchered the original idea
2018-12-07 13:28:35	mushmouth	well because it was going to be a sane ssl
2018-12-07 13:28:53	+jan6	how's it saner than anything else?
2018-12-07 13:29:10	mushmouth	fixes a lot of bugs openssl has/had and were not fixing them
2018-12-07 13:29:32	mushmouth	can i link to a talk jan6 on libressl?

2018-12-07 13:31:34	mushmouth	it a really good talk comparing open ssl to libre
2018-12-07 13:31:53	mushmouth	this was before it was in the base of OpenBSD
2018-12-07 13:32:16	+jan6	eh, sure, go libressh, libmusl, busybox, and bsd, and call yourself sane and suckless, if you want to
2018-12-07 13:32:21	+jan6	s/ssh/ssl
2018-12-07 13:32:21	sedbot	<jan6> eh, sure, go libressl, libmusl, busybox, and bsd, and call yourself sane and suckless, if you want to
2018-12-07 13:32:33	mushmouth	i did have a system with just libmusl
2018-12-07 13:32:36	mushmouth	it was nice and fast
2018-12-07 13:32:52	mushmouth	compared to glib
2018-12-07 13:33:02	+jan6	except some programs rely on glib features
2018-12-07 13:33:09	+jan6	but as long as they work, sure
2018-12-07 13:33:10	mushmouth	yeah that the only downside
2018-12-07 13:33:56	+jan6	hmm, I wonder how to have both and use glibc as a fallback automatically
2018-12-07 13:34:10	mushmouth	probably wouldn't be that hard
2018-12-07 13:34:25	+jan6	because sure, you could manually specify which to use
2018-12-07 13:35:32	mushmouth	well you can use older kernals as a fallback. i don't see why using musl and glib is any different
2018-12-07 13:37:59	mushmouth	if your already using musl im sure most purist won't touch anything that glib

2018-12-07 14:48:55	%ubergeek	It could be, if we were to get the research going
2018-12-07 14:49:05	%ubergeek	I don't see why it couldn't be 3D printed in the same way
2018-12-07 14:49:16	%ubergeek	Or, replaced with an electronic one
2018-12-07 14:49:48	mushmouth	anyway im going out today. anyone want to see some canadian food pr0n from me?
2018-12-07 14:49:50	%ubergeek	I'm more preferable to the biomech replacements.  I want to be a cyborg, I think it'd be cool
2018-12-07 14:50:27	jack3	electronic hearts?   then when Kim Phat Hed pops off an EMP bomb,  everybody with one konks out?   heh
2018-12-07 14:52:13	%ubergeek	It would up the game for nuclear war :)
2018-12-07 14:53:38	jack3	whew...

2018-12-07 15:03:08	%ubergeek	A 6 pack is doable for anyone...  just takes discipline, for the last few % points of BF
2018-12-07 15:03:32	%ubergeek	I finally recovered from Saturday aruond Wednesday lol

2018-12-07 17:57:11	ahriman	cdmnky: tell me this was in small town USA or something and not a larger city
2018-12-07 17:57:14	cdmnky	yeah... should've reported them on second thought
2018-12-07 17:57:25	cdmnky	ahriman: small town as in pop of less than 10k
2018-12-07 17:57:38	~ben	that's p small
2018-12-07 17:57:40	~ben	!w
2018-12-07 17:57:41	TildeBot	Traverse City, Michigan, USA (44.77, -85.7) -- Light snow and -4.4° C (24.1° F)
2018-12-07 17:57:43	ahriman	yeh that figures, thats why they got away with it
2018-12-07 17:57:55	ahriman	ben it's unseasonably warm here
2018-12-07 17:57:58	ahriman	!w
2018-12-07 17:57:58	TildeBot	Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States of America (36.85, -75.98) -- Partly cloudy and 8.3° C (46.9° F)
2018-12-07 17:58:25	cdmnky	population 9,617 in the whole town, which includes the 1,000 in my village
2018-12-07 17:58:43	cdmnky	median household income is $39k
2018-12-07 17:59:11	ahriman	whats the % below poverty line
2018-12-07 17:59:14	~ben	i wonder what the median income here is
2018-12-07 17:59:39	cdmnky	well, minimum wage is around $28k in NY right now
2018-12-07 18:00:08	cdmnky	"ratio of residents to sex offenders is 868 to 1"
2018-12-07 18:00:12	ahriman	full time, most min wage jobs aren't full time
2018-12-07 18:01:11	cdmnky	single family new house constructions: 1 in 1999, 1 in 2000, 1 in '07, and 4 in 2014
2018-12-07 18:01:19	ahriman	jeebus
2018-12-07 18:01:45	ahriman	so if you build a house youre probably the only one doing it that year
2018-12-07 18:01:46	cdmnky	i'm suprised, the population is up 2% from '00
2018-12-07 18:01:47	+aewens	Quick napkin math shows $28K/year is about $540 per week. Not too bad.
2018-12-07 18:02:23	+aewens	Which is about, what, $13/hour assuming 40 hours per week?
2018-12-07 18:02:25	cdmnky	aewens: and it's going up too. current wage is $10.70/hr, but the law raises it a dollar every year until it's $15.70
2018-12-07 18:02:50	cdmnky	might've over-estimated the gross yearly wage before
2018-12-07 18:03:02	~ben	median income here is $37k
2018-12-07 18:03:10	+aewens	My state is doing the same thing brining it from $7.85 up to $12.something by 2020. Not sure how I feel about it, but okay.
2018-12-07 18:03:20	~ben	that's so low
2018-12-07 18:03:24	+aewens	s/brin/bring/
2018-12-07 18:03:24	sedbot	<aewens> My state is doing the same thing bringing it from $7.85 up to $12.something by 2020. Not sure how I feel about it, but okay.
2018-12-07 18:03:36	cdmnky	what i'm more pissed about is how NYC get higher minimum wage than the rest of the state
2018-12-07 18:03:43	~ben	costs more to live there
2018-12-07 18:04:02	+aewens	ben: Well, the cost of living is also different in different places. Plus, even jobs at McD's pays more than $7.85/hr
2018-12-07 18:04:06	cdmnky	side note, the gas price on the nearby native reservation is $2.58/gal untaxed
2018-12-07 18:04:16	~ben	kinda pricey
2018-12-07 18:04:19	+aewens	It's $1.94 over here
2018-12-07 18:04:32	~ben	i saw $2.29 last night
2018-12-07 18:04:32	ahriman	minimum wage increases have never been linked to a reduction in the ability of businesses to hire as people have more expendable income to keep said businesses afloat, so min wage increases are always a good thing
2018-12-07 18:04:42	ahriman	$2.59 here for gas
2018-12-07 18:04:44	cdmnky	really? the average where I am dropped from $3.12 to $2.89 this week
2018-12-07 18:04:54	+aewens	And since I went shopping, my fuel saver card made it $0.70/gal. I paid $13 to fill an SUV, was a good day xD
2018-12-07 18:05:12	ahriman	aewens: im jelly
2018-12-07 18:05:28	cdmnky	the murder stats here are really low
2018-12-07 18:05:34	+aewens	Hi jelly, I'm aewens
2018-12-07 18:05:37	+aewens	#dadjokes 
2018-12-07 18:05:40	ahriman	OK DAD
2018-12-07 18:05:49	cdmnky	this decade, there was only two murders
2018-12-07 18:05:57	ahriman	cdmnky: well don't raise it
2018-12-07 18:06:12	+aewens	ahriman: But what if I really want to?
2018-12-07 18:06:27	ahriman	t h e r a p y
2018-12-07 18:06:29	cdmnky	although one of them was really tragic, one of my classmates was strangled to death when he was 11. still haven't found the killer
2018-12-07 18:06:35	+aewens	o k t h e n
2018-12-07 18:06:52	cdmnky	THAT would make a good podcast. My bet is the sheriff did it
2018-12-07 18:07:07	ahriman	you should do a documentary on it
2018-12-07 18:07:23	+aewens	I bet the parents or one of the neighbors
2018-12-07 18:07:44	cdmnky	the mother's alibi and her boyfriend were confirmed
2018-12-07 18:08:08	+aewens	This is how much I trust eye witness testimony: 0
2018-12-07 18:08:18	cdmnky	however, the mother was cheating on him with the sheriff, who was seen walking to his house via cameras at the hospital
2018-12-07 18:08:31	cdmnky	they called that an alibi because he was walking his dog
2018-12-07 18:08:43	ahriman	oh wow
2018-12-07 18:08:47	+aewens	Okay, now I feel like we should really look into this sheriff
2018-12-07 18:08:56	ahriman	D O C U M E N T A R Y
2018-12-07 18:09:15	cdmnky	meanwhile the boyfriend was treated horribly by police because he was black, and basically excommunicated from the town after being acquitted
2018-12-07 18:09:19	+aewens	I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot the deputy
2018-12-07 18:09:21	ahriman	it'll be like a netflix special and shit
2018-12-07 18:09:22	cdmnky	and the whole scandal with the DA too

2018-12-07 18:12:28	~ben	i saw the sign

2018-12-07 18:39:05	+aewens	Want to buy a book? Need the student number. Checking grades? We need your number. Paying uni bills? Not without your student number you aren't. Lose that number and you're essentially no longer a student that can interact with the system.
2018-12-07 18:39:20	ahriman	at my uni, they knew us by name, but it was super small
2018-12-07 18:39:48	sebboh	aewens: it sucks to be assigned a number rather than a name, but, the school district doesn't tatoo it on you like you are cattle..
2018-12-07 18:39:58	cdmnky	aewens: that's why I have my id card, it gives me access to everything (even restricted doors)
2018-12-07 18:40:00	sebboh	category error
2018-12-07 18:40:21	cdmnky	I swipe it and feel like I'm a military guy entering their post in a super-secret lab
2018-12-07 18:41:21	sebboh	most HID-type (RF ID) badges just emit an integer.  A static integer burned into the card at the factory... FYI 
2018-12-07 18:41:46	+aewens	sebboh: My issue was the turning people into numbers part, not that I felt the school was tattooing me like cattle.
2018-12-07 18:42:56	+aewens	Anyways, not a huge deal. Just curious if the rest of you shared my feelings towards the issue. Turns out it was a "wat" rather than a 
2018-12-07 18:42:59	+aewens	"yes"
2018-12-07 18:43:04	~ben	lol i'm glad i wasn't just a number
2018-12-07 18:43:04	+aewens	Stupid. Enter. Key.
2018-12-07 18:43:10	cdmnky	sebboh: it's a magstrip like a debit card. I use it to pay for lunches with it too
2018-12-07 18:43:12	~ben	had a number but i wasn't identified by it
2018-12-07 18:43:46	M-l4p1n	wonder what the hell has been going on on my network
2018-12-07 18:44:22	cdmnky	M-l4p1n: you host the bridge on your home network?
2018-12-07 18:44:54	M-l4p1n	yup. Dunno what went wrong. It might have been the router doing shenanigans again or whatever happened
2018-12-07 18:45:05	~ben	no fun :(
2018-12-07 18:45:06	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-07 18:45:47	cdmnky	M-l4p1n: maybe you should host it on tilde or something for a stable connection
2018-12-07 18:45:54	sebboh	when I was in college I had a number and it was needed for some things but somebody was always willing to look it up for students that didn't know it.   One thing was our test results would be printed out and posted in public, but only student numbers were on the printout.  So, everybody knows where they stand in the group but nobody knows where specific others do.  I figured that was OK.
2018-12-07 18:46:44	~ben	seems reasonable
2018-12-07 18:46:48	M-l4p1n	<irc_cdmnky "l4p1n: maybe you should host it "> Why not. Will have to investigate on how I can handle that properly :) 
2018-12-07 18:53:06	M-l4p1n	but now I'm thinking, we'll have to install a Matrix server on tilde beause config files :/
2018-12-07 18:53:20	cdmnky	oof
2018-12-07 18:53:48	~ben	i mean we could
2018-12-07 18:53:57	M-l4p1n	oof indeed 😁
2018-12-07 18:54:03	+jan6	why "have" to install?
2018-12-07 18:54:03	~ben	imo irc is more than sufficient
2018-12-07 18:54:06	+jan6	^
2018-12-07 18:54:08	M-l4p1n	but rooms are federated anyway 😂
2018-12-07 18:54:16	M-l4p1n	jan6: setup*
2018-12-07 18:54:35	~ben	on ~team, the limiting factor for everything is disk space
2018-12-07 18:54:53	M-l4p1n	ben:  if you don't want to lose meh x')
2018-12-07 18:54:54	M-l4p1n	But meh, I still can open up my client and deal with it heh :) 
2018-12-07 18:55:16	~ben	sounds like you just don't have your irc client set up properly ;)
2018-12-07 18:55:24	+jan6	yeah
2018-12-07 18:55:27	~ben	this bridge seems to be working alright though 
2018-12-07 18:55:31	M-l4p1n	btw, how much disk space you have ? connects to ssh and does df -h
2018-12-07 18:55:34	~ben	only one connection problem so far?
2018-12-07 18:55:50	~ben	it's two 250gb ssds in raid 1
2018-12-07 18:55:53	~ben	so 80gb free
2018-12-07 18:56:10	M-l4p1n	only one so far because my network has gone mad
2018-12-07 18:56:49	M-l4p1n	I've got too many gigabytes at my disposal so I pretty much don't really care about disk space
2018-12-07 18:57:09	~ben	i should've gone with the hdd version of this box
2018-12-07 18:57:18	~ben	(hetzner dedi)
2018-12-07 18:57:33	~ben	i suppose we could switch, but it's fine for now
2018-12-07 18:57:59	M-l4p1n	orrrr.... I know someone who has terabytes at his disposal for PeerTube videos. dunno how he did it tho
2018-12-07 18:58:50	~ben	could grab an auction server from hetzner and raid 0 it
2018-12-07 18:59:31	M-l4p1n	but if one disk screws over you, you lose everything
2018-12-07 18:59:56	~ben	true
2018-12-07 19:05:03	+jan6	I wonder if you were to buy a secondary large-storage hetzner box, how fast could you network them, would you be required to route back through the internet, or could you use internal networking, I wonder
2018-12-07 19:05:26	~khuxkm|lounge	so I have a 77 in Algebra 2, but hopefully my parents will understand that the teacher didn't follow the homework policy :P (he wasn't supposed to give me a 0 since I was absent on Thursday)
2018-12-07 19:05:42	+jan6	77/100 ?
2018-12-07 19:06:52	~khuxkm|lounge	yep
2018-12-07 19:06:59	~khuxkm|lounge	my mom grounds me for anything <80
2018-12-07 19:07:38	~ben	jan6: probably doable
2018-12-07 19:08:50	+jan6	if it was fast enough network, you could mount it on ~team and use it as just a normal drive ;P
2018-12-07 19:09:29	~ben	oh yeah that could be doable

2018-12-07 19:20:02	ahriman	jeebus the hetzner server auction prices are magnificent
2018-12-07 19:20:12	ahriman	plenty have fixed prices

2018-12-07 19:22:33	ahriman	cdmnky: do it! it's easy and fast
2018-12-07 19:22:49	ahriman	i have weechat centralized, have backups, and use it for several private git repos
2018-12-07 19:22:57	cdmnky	i would, but i'm broke lol
2018-12-07 19:23:09	ahriman	mine's at ramnode for $3/mo
2018-12-07 19:23:26	ahriman	if you want more space, same price at hetzner
2018-12-07 19:23:33	cdmnky	nah, I meant building one and putting it on my local LAN
2018-12-07 19:23:46	ahriman	oh
2018-12-07 19:24:07	ahriman	well a vps is virtualized so ... just spin up a container

2018-12-07 22:06:56	~ben	the problem is that you made that commit with an old parent commit

2018-12-08 02:09:01	mushmouth|otg	Asian societies make more sense 
2018-12-08 02:09:06	login	You'll be even more bamboozled by south-american-style or eastern societies...
2018-12-08 02:09:20	login	There was a thing I heard about societies being distinguished on the basis of culture
2018-12-08 02:09:21	mushmouth|otg	Probably 
2018-12-08 02:10:22	login	linear-active (germany), multi-active (Spain/Mexico), Reactive (Vietnam, China)

2018-12-08 02:10:47	login	(it'll look bad because of the transparency)
2018-12-08 02:11:20	login	So you'd have to make "background-color: white" for it to work
2018-12-08 02:12:03	mushmouth|otg	Japan makes the most sense to me
2018-12-08 02:15:50	mushmouth|otg	Also it opens up as transparent login
2018-12-08 02:16:52	%ubergeek	human societies, in general, make no sense to me.
2018-12-08 02:17:05	%ubergeek	Cat society?  I get that.
2018-12-08 02:17:17	%ubergeek	Cat society:  Do I know you?  Don't care.
2018-12-08 02:17:19	%ubergeek	:P
2018-12-08 02:18:00	%ubergeek	TIL, people pay for IRC clients...
2018-12-08 02:18:17	%ubergeek	And, evening all
2018-12-08 02:21:00	login	Well, if the client is "good enough"
2018-12-08 02:21:11	login	Paying for software is hard because marginal cost of production is actually near 0/
2018-12-08 02:21:30	login	So it should be priced depending on its intended audience size...
2018-12-08 02:22:07	login	And since it is presumed that software can exist without modification for more than a few human lifetimes and still be usable, the audience size is really large
2018-12-08 02:22:18	%ubergeek	Paying for something when a FOSS alternative exists is just mindblowing, to me
2018-12-08 02:22:28	login	But people pay for Windows...
2018-12-08 02:22:36	login	And developers make programs for Windows (free and paid)
2018-12-08 02:22:41	%ubergeek	Sorta...
2018-12-08 02:22:47	%ubergeek	Most people don't know they pay for Windows
2018-12-08 02:23:09	login	I mean, why isn't there really good FOSS software for music and video?
2018-12-08 02:23:13	login	and animation
2018-12-08 02:23:21	mushmouth|otg	I hate paying for windows. I usually bootleg or pirate it
2018-12-08 02:23:38	%ubergeek	You mean like Audacity, Hydrogen, or Blender?
2018-12-08 02:23:41	login	I also bootleg windows, but i worry about the bootleg software being a rootkit...
2018-12-08 02:23:58	-->	cognifice (cognifice@tilde.team) has joined #meta
2018-12-08 02:24:00	login	But Audacity cannot compete with FL Studio and similar
2018-12-08 02:24:07	login	I don't know about Hydrogen...
2018-12-08 02:24:11	%ubergeek	Hydrogen competes well with FL Studio
2018-12-08 02:24:18	%ubergeek	They are essentially the same thing
2018-12-08 02:24:28	login	And big animation studios' software vs. Blender
2018-12-08 02:24:38	%ubergeek	Big animation studios use Blender :)
2018-12-08 02:24:47	login	Autodesk Maya?
2018-12-08 02:24:51	cognifice	Hi, login and ubergeek.
2018-12-08 02:24:55	%ubergeek	Blender is used by Pixar, if I am not mistaken :)
2018-12-08 02:24:56	login	What about GIMP being better than Photoshop...
2018-12-08 02:24:59	login	hello cognifice 
2018-12-08 02:25:00	%ubergeek	enving cognifice 
2018-12-08 02:25:12	%ubergeek	GIMP is better, GIMP isn't taught in college course, though
2018-12-08 02:25:20	%ubergeek	*evening, even :)
2018-12-08 02:25:37	login	What about vector-editing?
2018-12-08 02:25:45	login	Is Inkscape really better than Illustrator?
2018-12-08 02:25:46	%ubergeek	My son just moved from Photoshop to GIMP, and he cannot believe that he didn't know about GIMP before
2018-12-08 02:25:55	%ubergeek	Dunno.  Don't use Inkscape.
2018-12-08 02:26:00	%ubergeek	Or Illustrator.
2018-12-08 02:26:10	login	Is AfterEffects really worse than the alternative?
2018-12-08 02:26:14	%ubergeek	And, I don't personally know anyone who does (Not saying that isn't important)
2018-12-08 02:27:22	login	Windows will only end when FOSS made for Linux becomes sufficiently nice, and schools start installing Linux instead of Windows...
2018-12-08 02:27:30	login	(bootleg windows, might i add)
2018-12-08 02:28:01	%ubergeek	I agree.  Until Linux becomes pre-installed, it wont make it anywhere
2018-12-08 02:28:25	login	But who's on the board of the Linux Foundation?
2018-12-08 02:28:28	%ubergeek	*widely pre-installed
2018-12-08 02:28:46	login	Will they keep Linux development focussed in other areas so that this particular line of action isn't followed?
2018-12-08 02:29:05	login	I mean, will they focus Linux development towards other areas compared to this one?
2018-12-08 02:29:14	%ubergeek	eh, probably not, since real money is made on servers and mobile
2018-12-08 02:29:21	login	THey won't say "don't do this", they'll say "what about all these other things that haven't been done. surely we should focus on those other things"
2018-12-08 02:29:29	%ubergeek	Both of which, Linux dominates (They kernel)
2018-12-08 02:29:33	%ubergeek	s/they/the/
2018-12-08 02:29:38	login	Well, mutilated linux...
2018-12-08 02:29:48	%ubergeek	Eh, it's Linux, regardless
2018-12-08 02:29:48	login	(on mobile at least)
2018-12-08 02:29:58	%ubergeek	Not GNU/Linux
2018-12-08 02:30:15	login	On servers, i see red hat being used a lot
2018-12-08 02:30:21	login	probably for their support
2018-12-08 02:30:31	%ubergeek	If I may interject, what you refer to as Android should really be called Android/Linux... :P
2018-12-08 02:30:53	%ubergeek	I see Redhat and Ubuntu being used a lot.  Actually, CentOS, to be more precise
2018-12-08 02:31:12	%ubergeek	RHEL is mainly used in older orgs, or heavily regulated industries.
2018-12-08 02:33:50	login	Why use Ubuntu over Debian>
2018-12-08 02:33:52	login	?
2018-12-08 02:33:57	login	Why is Ubuntu so popular?
2018-12-08 02:34:04	login	The first linux i ever heard about was Ubuntu
2018-12-08 02:41:37	BabiliBot	[title] Slow movement (culture) - Wikipedia (posted by UberGeek) <https://tilde.news/s/0qnsyf>
2018-12-08 02:41:56	%ubergeek	Support via Canonical
2018-12-08 02:42:03	%ubergeek	And, lots of wiki articles
2018-12-08 02:42:27	%ubergeek	And, lots of younger folk got used to it, before entering the professional world, and now they are most familiar with it
2018-12-08 03:00:04	+aewens	ubergeek: Almost all of my customers use RHEL/CentOS in their new systems...
2018-12-08 03:01:56	%ubergeek	aewens: do you work in a heavily regulated environment, or with heavily regulated industries?
2018-12-08 03:02:03	%ubergeek	*or older companies
2018-12-08 03:02:49	+aewens	Our customers are private businesses, universities, research centers, government, and military.
2018-12-08 03:03:18	%ubergeek	My org uses CentOS in one half, the other half uses Ubuntu.  The half that uses CentOS started before Ubuntu was thought of.  The half that uses Ubuntu launched after Ubuntu hit populr
2018-12-08 03:03:29	+aewens	The reason for RHEL/CentOS is that the software packaged for HPC systems are targeted for RPM-based distros
2018-12-08 03:03:31	%ubergeek	Yeah, that makes sense then aewens.  Heavily regulated :)
2018-12-08 03:04:16	+aewens	Try to get Lustre, GPFS, etc working on Ubuntu or other non-RPM distros and there would be reason to move from RHEL/CentOS
2018-12-08 03:04:31	<--	xvetrd (xvetrd@tilde.institute) has quit (quit: WeeChat 2.2)
2018-12-08 03:05:54	%ubergeek	It wouldn't be a reason to move.  It'd be a reason to add it to your build pipeline :)
2018-12-08 03:05:57	+aewens	My company is the one that chose to use RPM-based distros because it's the only OS that actually has support from vendors. If you want to get mass distributed storage, the Omni-Path networking infrastructure, etc working in something like Ubuntu you'll have your work cut out for you
2018-12-08 03:06:25	%ubergeek	Lustre is in Ubuntu's repos: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man7/lustre.7.html

2018-12-08 03:07:49	%ubergeek	*a deal killer
2018-12-08 03:08:01	+aewens	ubergeek: That is for v1.8.5, which is quite a bit behind where Lustre is at now
2018-12-08 03:08:19	%ubergeek	That was also for Precise, just the first hit I got
2018-12-08 03:08:27	%ubergeek	They are on Bionic now...

2018-12-08 03:09:26	%ubergeek	It would help if they actually worked with the Linux kernel team on Lustre FS, though: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/18/linux_4_18_rc_1_removes_lustre_filesystem/

2018-12-08 03:13:59	+aewens	Also, ubergeek, see the following: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search.py?q=lustre

2018-12-08 03:15:21	+aewens	If you can pay to re-train a company's staff to hadoop over Lustre that has been implemented in the company already, give it a whirl!
2018-12-08 03:16:49	+aewens	The reality is that Ubuntu's support for HPC software / drivers is either out-dated, flaky, or non-existent. It's fine for web servers and desktop use, but when you want to do real work then use a real OS like RHEL or CentOS.
2018-12-08 03:16:50	%ubergeek	Everyone already knows hadoop...  It's like the difference between Windows admins and Linux admins: Windows admins are cheap because they are a dime a dozen :)
2018-12-08 03:17:11	%ubergeek	"Real Work", like generating recommendations?
2018-12-08 03:17:19	%ubergeek	Or hosting thousands of inboxes?
2018-12-08 03:17:39	%ubergeek	"Real Work" is subjective :)
2018-12-08 03:18:30	%ubergeek	Or, implementing TensorFlow to build out a neural network?
2018-12-08 03:18:47	+aewens	My customers who use Windows are the ones tend to have the most issues. And by real work I mean something that needs real computing power to run.
2018-12-08 03:19:04	%ubergeek	Like TensorFlow?
2018-12-08 03:19:10	%ubergeek	Or ELKS?
2018-12-08 03:19:16	+aewens	e.g. brain research, modeling the universe, genome sequencing, predicitive weather models, etc
2018-12-08 03:19:34	%ubergeek	Brain Research, like modeling neural networks?
2018-12-08 03:20:03	%ubergeek	Or sequencing genes using MapReduce and Hadoop?
2018-12-08 03:20:10	+aewens	No, like modeling the human brain. Finding patterns in degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimers, etc
2018-12-08 03:20:22	%ubergeek	Modeling the human brain, using neural network models...
2018-12-08 03:20:55	+aewens	I think I've heard of maybe 3 of our customers using hadoop, MapReduce, and neural networks
2018-12-08 03:21:01	%ubergeek	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307307534_DeepAD_Alzheimer%27s_Disease_Classification_via_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_using_MRI_and_fMRI
2018-12-08 03:21:24	+aewens	Anecdata != the industry standard
2018-12-08 03:21:56	%ubergeek	Probably, because it's a heavily regulated industry, and Ubuntu just recently got cerfitied for things like FIPS 200
2018-12-08 03:22:42	%ubergeek	That's not Anectodtes...  I just posted a research paper written on the subject of Convoutional Neural Networks in Alzheimer's research, on Ubuntu :)
2018-12-08 03:22:47	cognifice	https://www.xiph.org/about/
2018-12-08 03:22:49	TildeBot	Xiph.org: About 
2018-12-08 03:23:58	+aewens	Only a small handful of our customers are in regulated environments. The bulk are expanding on work that has already been paved by others. You don't constantly make new highways between two cities, someone has already done that work and effort is better focused elsewhere. Same principle applies
2018-12-08 03:24:44	%ubergeek	You just named a whole slew of customers that would be in highly regulated industry:  Education, Medical Research, Government, and Military
2018-12-08 03:24:54	+aewens	Most are using MPI libraries and job scheduling systems like SLURM or SGE to distribute job scripts across a cluster to maximize the throughput of systems.
2018-12-08 03:25:18	%ubergeek	I'm sure they are.  Because they've built that infra over time, on top of those technologies.
2018-12-08 03:25:26	%ubergeek	Same reason my company still heavily uses PHP
2018-12-08 03:25:44	+aewens	ubergeek: Unfortunately, most of those industries you would hope would be regulated, but only a small subset actually employ any meaningful kind of regulations.
2018-12-08 03:25:47	%ubergeek	And CentOS :)
2018-12-08 03:26:19	%ubergeek	All of the ones you named are pretty heavily regulated...  Except maybe the "private industry", but that all depends on what work they do
2018-12-08 03:26:35	+aewens	If we decided all of our machines would be sold with SUSE by default tomorrow, most of our customers would just accept this because it's easier to take what's provided than set it up themselves.
2018-12-08 03:26:37	%ubergeek	Mil is severely regulated, as is government, at all levels.
2018-12-08 03:27:26	+aewens	Sure, but they don't make up the bulk of our customer base. Most are in the private sector, we just also sell to the majority of universities and gov/mil in the US
2018-12-08 03:27:30	%ubergeek	Education is generally ran by government, so heavily regulated.  Maybe not FIPS, but if they deal with any mil research, most systems will meet milspec
2018-12-08 03:28:14	%ubergeek	If they are private sector, with gov contracts, they are heavily regulated regarding any system touching gov networks...
2018-12-08 03:28:17	+aewens	Most education stuff is just math/science departments buying equipment for running labs/models
2018-12-08 03:28:20	%ubergeek	I know, because I just went through this
2018-12-08 03:28:40	%ubergeek	If those labs/models are used in gov research, they are heavily regulated.
2018-12-08 03:28:50	%ubergeek	Especially if they are used in mil research
2018-12-08 03:29:17	%ubergeek	CUBRC here does a lot of mil and gov contracts.  All systems need to meet FIPS 200, minimally, for example.  And they are wholly private (now)
2018-12-08 03:29:20	+aewens	And the majority of private sector customers we have don't have gov contracts. I know because I talk with all of them through the ordering / install process when we drop off the equipment to install them in their data centers
2018-12-08 03:29:28	%ubergeek	Neat.
2018-12-08 03:29:41	%ubergeek	And, I take it they are older orgs?
2018-12-08 03:30:21	+aewens	We have customers who have been buying from us for years, and others who are new businesses getting started.
2018-12-08 03:30:29	%ubergeek	Or, could it be your org standardized on something that could meet gov contract requirements, so it could be sold to gov customers, and non-gov customer w/o customization?
2018-12-08 03:31:48	+aewens	That's part of it, but each year we look into doing setups with OSes like Ubuntu since we get a few inquiries about it here and there and there just isn't the support from vendors to provide all our services and products with it.
2018-12-08 03:32:35	%ubergeek	Another example of mostly younger orgs starting with Ubuntu, is because k8s has been available for Ubuntu for quite some time.
2018-12-08 03:33:02	%ubergeek	CentOS/RHEL 7 was the first version to be able to install it.  Ubuntu has been able to since 2016.
2018-12-08 03:33:21	+aewens	If you look at the release notes for RHEL 8 that was released recently, you see the amount of container support it's bringing to the table
2018-12-08 03:33:36	%ubergeek	It *just* brought that
2018-12-08 03:34:03	%ubergeek	And, by "Able to since 2016", I mean, in the repos.  It's been there since 2012, if I recall
2018-12-08 03:34:03	+aewens	Well, again, not many big players are using it, the demand is not there.
2018-12-08 03:34:10	mushmouth	i hear the main person behind ext file system doesn't like the new CoC
2018-12-08 03:34:18	%ubergeek	Many, many, many big players are using k8s...
2018-12-08 03:34:39	mushmouth	if the file system was gone suddenly that would truly mess up linux
2018-12-08 03:34:55	mushmouth	xfs is no where near perfect
2018-12-08 03:35:04	%ubergeek	ie, Netflix.  Google.  Facebook.
2018-12-08 03:35:14	+aewens	Kids can do their docker containers in k8s running a series of microservices to host a CRUD wrapper around a database with serverless functions to TensorFlow, but that doesn't mean exising companies want that
2018-12-08 03:35:45	%ubergeek	Existing companies *should* want that...
2018-12-08 03:36:14	%ubergeek	And, if you consider the company that manages the most visited website on the globe as "kids"...  well...

2018-12-08 03:36:41	%ubergeek	... it goes back to my original statement:  "Real Work" is subjective
2018-12-08 03:37:00	mushmouth	exactly
2018-12-08 03:37:07	mushmouth	everyone has their own definition of real work
2018-12-08 03:37:11	+aewens	Companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc are the same ones that scoop up kids fresh out of college. So yes, kids.
2018-12-08 03:37:18	mushmouth	mine happens to be low level kernel/hacking
2018-12-08 03:37:27	fosslinux	lol

2018-12-08 03:46:40	fosslinux	why
2018-12-08 03:46:41	fosslinux	what happened
2018-12-08 03:46:57	mushmouth	fosslinux: im using a mac host. and it has shit virtualzation
2018-12-08 03:47:05	fosslinux	what a suprise
2018-12-08 03:47:07	fosslinux	its macs
2018-12-08 03:47:10	fosslinux	what do you expect
2018-12-08 03:47:24	mushmouth	but im too lazy to use a linux system right now. until i upgrade the ram to 8 or 16
2018-12-08 03:47:37	fosslinux	whats the ram rn
2018-12-08 03:47:55	mushmouth	4gb
2018-12-08 03:47:59	fosslinux	thats fine
2018-12-08 03:47:59	mushmouth	and amd apu a10

2018-12-08 03:48:13	fosslinux	why are you on a mac
2018-12-08 03:48:25	%ubergeek	The only saving grace is 95% of my time is spent in a terminal, ssh'd into a linux box
2018-12-08 03:48:25	mushmouth	it one of my macbook air in 2015??? model
2018-12-08 03:48:33	mushmouth	i had 8gb of ram and only spent 1grand on it
2018-12-08 03:48:36	mushmouth	it has*
2018-12-08 03:48:39	fosslinux	ONLY
2018-12-08 03:48:40	%ubergeek	Work required MacOS
2018-12-08 03:48:41	fosslinux	ONLY
2018-12-08 03:48:46	mushmouth	well
2018-12-08 03:48:48	fosslinux	$1000
2018-12-08 03:48:52	mushmouth	other laptop was 1grand ish too
2018-12-08 03:48:53	fosslinux	8gb
2018-12-08 03:49:04	%ubergeek	So, I gave them my expensive assed Latitude, for an even more expensive Mac Book Pro
2018-12-08 03:49:06	mushmouth	im going to upgrade the thinkpad too 16gb eventually
2018-12-08 03:49:07	ahriman	i spent $500 on an X240 two years ago w/ 8GB ram and a haswell i5
2018-12-08 03:49:18	fosslinux	you see
2018-12-08 03:49:33	ahriman	actually like $460
2018-12-08 03:49:42	mushmouth	i have a thinkpad t420 which doesn't do much
2018-12-08 03:49:49	mushmouth	i5 cpu
2018-12-08 03:49:52	ahriman	that was with an extended battery
2018-12-08 03:49:54	mushmouth	think 2nd generation
2018-12-08 03:50:04	%ubergeek	Because they need "control" of the OS.  I got it with an "official image", wiped it, and installed a clean one
2018-12-08 03:50:04	ahriman	i gave my t420 to my dad so he could have a linux laptop

2018-12-08 03:58:05	%ubergeek	See?  Isn't saying {Distro} on Windows just wrong, and your brain autocorrects to "On Linux"? lololol
2018-12-08 03:58:17	mushmouth	yeah
2018-12-08 03:58:31	mushmouth	because it more natural to say distro or linux since that the most popular nix right now
2018-12-08 03:59:31	mushmouth	like i may setup one of my laptops with gentoo

2018-12-08 04:03:41	fosslinux	so linux from scratch + portage (stage0) creates stage1 creates stage2 creates stage3

2018-12-08 04:03:45	TildeBot	no u infinity fosslinux
2018-12-08 04:04:06	mushmouth	i think i do boot disk then straight to stage 3
2018-12-08 04:04:12	fosslinux	yeah
2018-12-08 04:04:15	fosslinux	thats the normal way
2018-12-08 04:04:26	fosslinux	but then you can't ensure that stage 3 dosen't have malware

2018-12-08 04:39:27	~khuxkm|lounge	so I'm doing some stupid shit in Google Sheets and I hate how Google implemented RANK (if it's based off of Excel, fuck MS too)
2018-12-08 04:39:45	~khuxkm|lounge	I want to rank teams in the NFL in a spreadsheet

2018-12-08 04:40:05	~khuxkm|lounge	and the stupid system is being weird
2018-12-08 04:40:25	~khuxkm|lounge	so say I have 2 teams tied for 2nd (Chiefs and Saints)
2018-12-08 04:40:36	~khuxkm|lounge	the next place (should be 3rd) is counted as 4th
2018-12-08 04:41:10	~khuxkm|lounge	there are 3 teams with the same rating as the 4th place (Patriots, Chargers, Texans)
2018-12-08 04:41:19	~khuxkm|lounge	so the next ranking? 7th
2018-12-08 04:44:08	%ubergeek	I think you need something more complex than excel/google sheets
2018-12-08 04:44:22	%ubergeek	I don't think it handles sorting of equal values well
2018-12-08 04:47:32	~khuxkm|lounge	that's not the issue
2018-12-08 04:47:41	~khuxkm|lounge	the issue is how it handles the rank function

2018-12-08 10:18:11	ahriman	oh jeebus

2018-12-08 17:15:11	+jan6	rejoin, if you're op then msg chanserv register #thunix, boom
2018-12-08 17:49:30	desvox	mushmouth: you can emulate the third mouse button by holding shift i think
2018-12-08 17:49:36	desvox	at least on 9front
2018-12-08 17:49:41	mushmouth	oh
2018-12-08 17:49:48	mushmouth	oh well bought a proper three button mouse
2018-12-08 17:49:55	desvox	thats way better tbh
2018-12-08 17:50:12	desvox	love how thinkpads actually have 3 button trackpads
2018-12-08 17:50:21	desvox	i just have 0 use for 9front despite having it installed
2018-12-08 17:50:33	+jan6	lol
2018-12-08 17:51:06	+jan6	most linux wms allows to middleclick by pressing left and right at the same time, too
2018-12-08 17:51:22	 *	jan6 loves the think-dot, tbh
2018-12-08 17:51:36	desvox	yeah i used to have to do the two-button thing on my old laptop
2018-12-08 17:51:58	desvox	i would use the clitmouse if the rubber wasnt broken when i got this thinkpad
2018-12-08 17:52:12	desvox	ive had it for almost two years and havent replaced it tbh
2018-12-08 17:52:15	+jan6	I never use the trackpad if I have the think-dot, lol (and middle-click+dot=scroll wich is also a lot better that the trackpad gestures imo)
2018-12-08 17:58:48	mushmouth	see im not the only one who calls it the clitmouse why is that so weird to some people?
2018-12-08 18:04:01	+jan6	wellll
2018-12-08 18:04:10	+jan6	you see, it's made of two words
2018-12-08 18:04:28	+jan6	and most people don't associate them in the correct way

2018-12-08 18:16:32	+jan6	mate is kinda fine
2018-12-08 18:17:05	amcclure	any you'd recommend?
2018-12-08 18:17:11	+jan6	I personally like cinnamon tho
2018-12-08 18:17:25	+jan6	it is a bit heavier, but still better than gnome3
2018-12-08 18:18:58	-->	murii (murii@90.95.168.249) has joined #meta
2018-12-08 18:19:32	+jan6	mate and cinnamon are both mostly gnome-compatible, too, forks and continuations of the gnome2 (iirc mate tries to be light and keep it as gnome2-but-still-maintained, whereas cinnamon is just "we don't like gnome3, so we just work on gnome2 to add all the cool parts of it")
2018-12-08 18:22:24	murii	does anyone know what does the "10!" in white and red stand for in byobu?

2018-12-08 18:29:17	mushmouth	i'll look at it now
2018-12-08 18:31:48	+jan6	so far "battery and solder fatigue"
2018-12-08 18:42:54	+jan6	aaand that's pretty much all
2018-12-08 18:43:03	+jan6	sorry for wasting your time
2018-12-08 18:43:29	mushmouth	don't worry it's pretty interesting
2018-12-08 18:43:45	+jan6	boils down to "you can replace battery with a bigger one, and if it's not booting then reflow the masking chip (possibly others too if issues)"
2018-12-08 18:48:46	+jan6	this guy seems to have other stuffs too, such as how to open a famicom cartridge

2018-12-08 19:52:37	ahriman	but im digging doing everything manually rn
2018-12-08 19:56:48	 *	jan6 is thining of making a bot in assembly, based on other's ones
2018-12-08 19:57:06	+jan6	gonna reclaim #chaos eventually, just you wait for it! ;P
2018-12-08 19:57:12	ahriman	sounds like a hell of a project, go for it if you feel like it
2018-12-08 19:57:41	ahriman	are you banned from #chaos or something?
2018-12-08 19:57:58	+jan6	there are already assembly irc bots, I'd just have to verify they work here, and how I'm supposed to use channel mode switch as a trigger
2018-12-08 19:58:00	+jan6	nah
2018-12-08 19:58:03	+jan6	just not owner anymore
2018-12-08 19:59:46	+jan6	it's a rivalry over that between æwens and I, he came up with the idea, I claimed the channel first, then opers dropped the channel, I reclaimed, then khux-the-evil-op force-changed the owner, æewens made a bot to automatically reclaim it (and do other stuff) and been the king ever since, pretty much
2018-12-08 20:00:16	+jan6	of course he made a poetic wiki article portraying himself as the usurped king, and stuff too, lol
2018-12-08 20:00:43	ahriman	haha

2018-12-09 01:26:50	~ben	but it wasn't worth the 45 minute train ride

2018-12-09 01:33:14	~ben	nice
2018-12-09 01:33:16	mushmouth	so i was a little happy when i told the game store about the nes
2018-12-09 01:33:29	~ben	oh deepend your masto link is wrong
2018-12-09 01:33:31	slipyx	oh no https://explorer.bitcoin.com/btc/address/1122NYbAT2KkZDZ5TFvGy4D2Ut7eYfx4en
2018-12-09 01:33:34	mushmouth	they said i can keep the games and controllers since it a bundle
2018-12-09 01:33:39	npa	oh sweet, 10/10
2018-12-09 01:33:47	fosslinux	just a bit easy to forge the From: header
2018-12-09 01:33:49	npa	but i haven't got DMARC, and my reverse DNS doesn't match
2018-12-09 01:34:01	~ben	set your rdns!
2018-12-09 01:34:08	~ben	dmarc is stupid easy too
2018-12-09 01:34:10	npa	it's set to mail.pat.sh rather than pat.sh
2018-12-09 01:34:19	fosslinux	slipyx: not good
2018-12-09 01:34:23	~deepend	rdns is very important if you want emails to be accepted
2018-12-09 01:34:28	fosslinux	people are already falling for the scam
2018-12-09 01:34:28	npa	i guess i set it up wrong ben
2018-12-09 01:34:33	~ben	then change it lol
2018-12-09 01:34:43	npa	when I port my stuff to hetzner sure
2018-12-09 01:34:46	~ben	also see dig +short txt _dmarc.tilde.team
2018-12-09 01:34:50	~ben	for an example of dmarc
2018-12-09 01:34:58	~ben	just chnage the mail address and then you have dmarc
2018-12-09 01:35:20	npa	...and that's it..?
2018-12-09 01:35:25	~ben	yup
2018-12-09 01:35:26	npa	lol what
2018-12-09 01:35:35	~ben	and rdns just change the address to pat.sh
2018-12-09 01:35:44	~ben	on your hosting panel
2018-12-09 01:35:49	~ben	wherver you have it
2018-12-09 01:36:06	npa	so the hostname of the container that the mail is setup on is mail.pat.sh
2018-12-09 01:36:13	npa	idk, the instructions told me to do that
2018-12-09 01:36:26	npa	i'm switching to dovecot, so I'll do everything properly next time
2018-12-09 01:36:30	~ben	oh you didn't set it up manually?
2018-12-09 01:36:34	~ben	dovecot is just imap
2018-12-09 01:36:40	npa	i used iredmail
2018-12-09 01:36:44	~ben	ohh ok
2018-12-09 01:36:45	npa	i've never set up mail before
2018-12-09 01:36:48	~ben	doesn't that use imap itself?
2018-12-09 01:36:55	npa	yes
2018-12-09 01:37:00	~ben	s/imap/dovecot
2018-12-09 01:37:01	sedbot	<ben> doesn't that use dovecot itself?
2018-12-09 01:37:01	npa	but some bundled shit
2018-12-09 01:37:12	~ben	postfix + dovecot is nice
2018-12-09 01:37:48	npa	what's ri in the DMARC?
2018-12-09 01:38:05	~ben	it's a timeout thing
2018-12-09 01:38:34	npa	like a TTL?
2018-12-09 01:39:12	~ben	um lemme double check
2018-12-09 01:39:44	~ben	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489#section-6.3
2018-12-09 01:39:48	TildeBot	RFC 7489 - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) https://bhh.sh/2ga
2018-12-09 01:39:54	~ben	ri => report interval

2018-12-09 01:40:06	~ben	with the setting i have there
2018-12-09 01:40:13	~ben	since i don't ask for an aggregate report
2018-12-09 01:40:39	~ben	ruf vs rua
2018-12-09 01:40:56	%ubergeek	fwiw, if someone hacked me, and either saw me nekkid, or watched the pr0n I was watching...  God help them, and their poor eyes.

2018-12-09 03:47:48	mushmouth	which it's usually mendatory
2018-12-09 03:48:14	mushmouth	my illness and syndrome made it so i didn't have to
2018-12-09 03:48:39	fosslinux	kk
2018-12-09 03:48:56	mushmouth	i just had to take other stuff for credit for it
2018-12-09 03:49:34	mushmouth	and i never had to do gym either
2018-12-09 03:49:37	mushmouth	my back was really bad

2018-12-09 03:56:28	mushmouth	my twisting testicles made people realize how much pain i can actually tolerate
2018-12-09 03:56:34	mushmouth	i lasted 2 days without realizing the pain
2018-12-09 03:56:43	mushmouth	and the fact it wasn't normal
2018-12-09 03:57:21	mushmouth	i know a little tmi sometimes
2018-12-09 03:57:25	mushmouth	but just so people are aware
2018-12-09 03:59:23	fosslinux	lol i am
2018-12-09 03:59:35	fosslinux	very aware of pain
2018-12-09 04:10:33	mushmouth	fosslinux: it also kind of made me very sad about getting future partners
2018-12-09 04:10:38	mushmouth	because i thought it was a weird thing
2018-12-09 04:10:50	mushmouth	but realizing it like a 50/50 thing
2018-12-09 04:10:53	mushmouth	doesn't bother me
2018-12-09 04:27:24	ahriman	hello hello
2018-12-09 04:33:09	mushmouth	hey ahriman 
2018-12-09 04:34:45	fosslinux	whats up ahriman
2018-12-09 04:37:20	ahriman	nada mucho just got off work, now to write some hacky scripts for ~inst
2018-12-09 04:37:56	fosslinux	:P py?
2018-12-09 04:40:56	ahriman	yeh
2018-12-09 04:41:14	fosslinux	py is good for sys managment
2018-12-09 04:44:58	ahriman	that's why I want to learn it
2018-12-09 04:45:17	ahriman	i don't want to do software development, but system administration
2018-12-09 04:45:32	fosslinux	be a good sysadmin
2018-12-09 04:45:48	fosslinux	i dont like sysadmins in general :P
2018-12-09 04:45:52	fosslinux	they're too contorlling
2018-12-09 04:47:02	ahriman	ill try lol
2018-12-09 04:47:13	fosslinux	;)
2018-12-09 04:47:33	fosslinux	what do you work as at the moment ahriman?
2018-12-09 04:47:39	ahriman	do you know of an alternative to os.system("command") that won't echo the results of the command to the terminal?
2018-12-09 04:47:59	ahriman	right now a restaurant, I used to work for a large web hosting company. though that was a shitshow

2018-12-09 04:48:34	ahriman	gracias
2018-12-09 04:48:50	fosslinux	if its linux only 
2018-12-09 04:49:13	fosslinux	os.system("commmannddddddd > /dev/null 2>&1")
2018-12-09 04:49:15	fosslinux	or
2018-12-09 04:49:22	ahriman	d'oh
2018-12-09 04:49:28	ahriman	why didn't i think of that
2018-12-09 04:49:49	ahriman	i want to learn the 'correct' way so i'll try subprocess instead
2018-12-09 04:50:09	fosslinux	def silentcmd(command):
2018-12-09 04:50:32	fosslinux	    os.system(command + " > /dev/null 2>&1")
2018-12-09 04:50:43	fosslinux	to avoid rewriting that every time
2018-12-09 04:51:25	ahriman	nifty little function there
2018-12-09 04:51:34	fosslinux	:D
2018-12-09 04:52:04	ahriman	there's only one call in this script but i'll remember to functionificate it in the future if I need to do multiple calls
2018-12-09 04:52:19	fosslinux	functions ftw
2018-12-09 04:52:26	fosslinux	i functionificate pretty much everything
2018-12-09 04:52:36	fosslinux	usually my code ends with
2018-12-09 04:52:58	fosslinux	if __name__ == '__main__':
2018-12-09 04:53:01	fosslinux	    main()
2018-12-09 04:54:54	ahriman	yeh that's how i'm forcing myself to write
2018-12-09 04:55:27	ahriman	seems like the best way to write reusable code
2018-12-09 04:55:49	fosslinux	yes
2018-12-09 04:55:51	fosslinux	for sure
2018-12-09 04:57:42	ahriman	hm, maybe you know the answer to this
2018-12-09 04:57:48	npa	use the subprocess library ahriman
2018-12-09 04:58:11	npa	oh, but if stderr, i think you have to play around to find that out
2018-12-09 04:58:21	ahriman	npa: i did: 23:49:48         ahriman ? i want to learn the 'correct' way so i'll try subprocess instead
2018-12-09 04:58:44	npa	oh lol
2018-12-09 04:58:47	npa	i can't read
2018-12-09 04:58:54	ahriman	lol you're good, yo
2018-12-09 04:59:14	ahriman	i have hit a snag semi-related to that
2018-12-09 04:59:40	ahriman	im trying to load the output of "who | awk '{print $1}'" into a variable then iterate on each entry
2018-12-09 05:00:04	ahriman	getting error can't iterate on int when i've tried initializing it as a list
2018-12-09 05:00:30	ahriman	is there a list() conversion function like there's an int()?
2018-12-09 05:00:44	fosslinux	what are you wanting ot convert to a list?
2018-12-09 05:00:51	fosslinux	oh lol im blind
2018-12-09 05:01:00	fosslinux	so there has to be a delimiter
2018-12-09 05:01:05	fosslinux	whats you're delimeter
2018-12-09 05:01:18	ahriman	\n i suppose since it's line by line
2018-12-09 05:01:51	fosslinux	list = output.split("\n")
2018-12-09 05:02:11	ahriman	ah okay, that makes sense. thanks muchly, fosslinux

2018-12-09 15:23:45	+jan6	existing, that's all
2018-12-09 15:24:00	+jan6	cool history video, event happened 1999 it seems

2018-12-09 15:24:45	+jan6	linux is such kewl
2018-12-09 15:26:00	mushmouth	i heard the person behind ext fs doesn't like the new coc
2018-12-09 15:27:07	+jan6	sure
2018-12-09 15:27:20	+jan6	I don't like a coc either
2018-12-09 15:27:56	+jan6	COC = "relative rules up to anyone to interpret" which I dislike
2018-12-09 15:29:01	+jan6	one person's "friendly joke" might be "offensive joke" to someone else, and you have absolutely no way of knowing what every single person seeing it will think in advance

2018-12-09 15:30:05	+jan6	basically as people have said, it's kindof a way to say "we don't like you, you did this prohibited thing 20 years ago, it's not allowed, we're gonna throw you out"
2018-12-09 15:31:37	mushmouth	i just find it sad people are taking joking too seriously
2018-12-09 15:31:49	mushmouth	and telling us to make our own platform if we don't like it
2018-12-09 15:34:09	+jan6	well, the sad thing is, we kinda would have to do it if we don't like the coc, and don't have enough power and arguments to remove it
2018-12-09 15:35:25	+jan6	all you'd have to do is fork it, anyway, possibly push all changes as a single user, if needed
2018-12-09 15:35:49	+jan6	could call it Linix or something ;P
2018-12-09 15:53:05	mushmouth	we can call it janinix :P

2018-12-09 16:07:44	+jan6	it's not lilinux after all ;P
2018-12-09 16:11:03	mushmouth	i feel like we have to make our own linux fork
2018-12-09 16:15:40	mushmouth	like i have a feeling the new tos/CoC is not going to change

2018-12-09 19:54:21	~ben	mostly open-world rpg type games lately
2018-12-09 19:54:23	~ben	in 4k
2018-12-09 19:54:30	~ben	ehhh
2018-12-09 19:54:38	~deepend	you can play terminal games in 4k.. loll

2018-12-09 19:55:49	~deepend	the ascii characters are so refined at 4k! lol 
2018-12-09 19:55:52	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-09 19:56:22	ahriman	im not a huge gamer so i consider myself lucky to not have to deal with that stuff
2018-12-09 19:57:31	~ben	i keep it isolated on a different disk and dualboot
2018-12-09 19:57:37	~ben	it's not bad once you get it set up
2018-12-09 19:58:14	~deepend	i'm not a huge gamer either.. but I tend to like games that just dont work on linux.. :S  so kinda in same spot as ben
2018-12-09 19:58:22	~ben	yup :/
2018-12-09 19:58:29	~ben	i tried to launch the witcher 3 with wine
2018-12-09 19:58:38	~ben	and i got like 2 fps
2018-12-09 19:58:42	ahriman	ew
2018-12-09 19:58:45	~deepend	i find when i dual boot i get lazy and then just never boot back into linux..
2018-12-09 19:58:59	~ben	my laptop stays in debian all the time
2018-12-09 19:59:08	fosslinux	2fps yuck
2018-12-09 19:59:19	~ben	60fps once i went back to windows :/
2018-12-09 19:59:37	fosslinux	:\
2018-12-09 19:59:39	~deepend	most of the other computers here are in linux of some sort.. the kids computers are both linux
2018-12-09 19:59:47	~ben	nice
2018-12-09 20:00:42	~deepend	the wifeys laptop is in linux.. i guess I should just run what I push on others and stop whining lol
2018-12-09 20:00:48	 *	jan6 loves sandbox, and multiplayer, and prefers 3d, but lappytoppy integrated graphics are not that good, especially since it's a lil dusty and a few years old...
2018-12-09 20:00:54	+jan6	linux ftw, btw
2018-12-09 20:01:14	~ben	i'd run linux all the time on my desktop if it could handle my graphics card properly
2018-12-09 20:01:19	+jan6	I've quite literally only used linux for my entire life ;P
2018-12-09 20:01:19	~deepend	just seems like a waste of a 1080ti to run a OS that most games dont push it enough 
2018-12-09 20:01:20	fosslinux	rip
2018-12-09 20:01:26	~ben	yeah same
2018-12-09 20:01:34	~ben	same card :)
2018-12-09 20:01:36	+jan6	run two OSs at the same time then ;P
2018-12-09 20:01:41	fosslinux	i've pretty much totally switched to linux on my lappytoppy
2018-12-09 20:01:42	~ben	i do
2018-12-09 20:01:44	~ben	dualboot
2018-12-09 20:01:48	+jan6	same time
2018-12-09 20:02:13	~ben	one would be emulated then

2018-12-09 20:03:40	~ben	Ever dreamed of what you could do with a $30,000 computer? Turns out the answer is "a lot".
2018-12-09 20:03:55	fosslinux	helll yeah
2018-12-09 20:03:59	~ben	server chips

2018-12-09 20:04:41	+jan6	ever dreamed what you could do with a $1000 phone? answer is also "a lot"
2018-12-09 20:05:18	~ben	my phone was almost that much :x
2018-12-09 20:05:57	fosslinux	mines 200$ lmao
2018-12-09 20:06:01	+jan6	was it an eye-phone?
2018-12-09 20:06:11	 *	jan6 gets his dagger ready
2018-12-09 20:06:13	ahriman	i don't want a 30,000$ computer i just want a talos 2 mid-range workstation
2018-12-09 20:06:34	ahriman	eh my phone was like $600 when i got it
2018-12-09 20:06:42	ahriman	financed over 24 months
2018-12-09 20:06:48	ahriman	er 20
2018-12-09 20:06:50	~deepend	30000 computer sounds good to me.. but I'd waste it for sure.. lol
2018-12-09 20:07:17	~deepend	i cant handle the computer processing power I have now between this computer and my rack of servers downstairs lol
2018-12-09 20:07:42	 *	jan6 was really surprised at how long he could use his rooted LOW SPECS android 2.3 phone, when carefully selecting stuff and not minding the slowness
2018-12-09 20:08:10	ahriman	i remember android 2.3 lol
2018-12-09 20:08:35	+jan6	just compile stuff at your free time, or become part of SETI, or mine etherium or whatever crypto or stuff
2018-12-09 20:08:43	~ben	no it's a pixl 2 xl
2018-12-09 20:08:44	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-09 20:08:49	~deepend	guess that old of a phone is fine if you dont mind the security risks lol 
2018-12-09 20:08:51	+jan6	tbh, android 4 was when it all began to go downhill
2018-12-09 20:08:59	~ben	i remember android 2
2018-12-09 20:08:59	+jan6	UI wise
2018-12-09 20:09:03	~ben	.0
2018-12-09 20:09:09	+jan6	wewlad
2018-12-09 20:09:15	~ben	i like the rig that i've built
2018-12-09 20:09:18	~ben	plenty beefy
2018-12-09 20:09:24	~ben	plus now i have my little media box
2018-12-09 20:09:33	+jan6	also, 2.X was back when the point releases actually were enough of a deal to get their own names
2018-12-09 20:09:41	~ben	yup
2018-12-09 20:10:02	~ben	donut eclair froyo
2018-12-09 20:10:06	~ben	gingerbread
2018-12-09 20:10:40	+jan6	2.2 froyo, 2.3 gingerbread, 3 honeycomb, 4 ice cream sandwitch, 4.4 (or 4.1?) kit kat, 5 lollipop, and I don't care about the later sheit ;P (7 nougat 8 oreo)
2018-12-09 20:10:59	~deepend	think my biggest mistake when moving over to android was picking a samsung phone to do it.. next time if I stick with android i'll probably try another companies phone
2018-12-09 20:11:11	+jan6	OOF
2018-12-09 20:11:18	 *	jan6 has been a Huawei Boyo
2018-12-09 20:11:28	ahriman	i love HTC but unfortunately they went rip because the googlemonster bought them
2018-12-09 20:11:28	+jan6	I WAS happy with huawei
2018-12-09 20:11:52	+jan6	UNTIL THEY F*IN SHUT DOWN THEIR HIDDEN BOOTLOADER UNLOCK PAGE FOR NO REASON
2018-12-09 20:12:56	~deepend	wish phone manufacturers would stop trying to lock down the devices.  it'd make it a much better experience
2018-12-09 20:12:58	 *	jan6 is so sad the days of "just run this batch file and boom, now put whatever on the sd card" are over
2018-12-09 20:13:35	~ben	pixels are still bootloader unlockable afaict
2018-12-09 20:14:06	ahriman	ben i may make a pixel my next phone then
2018-12-09 20:14:07	+jan6	there are the huge "unlock apps" that attempt to unlock every single phone ever (if the demand's high enough) but they don't worky for my model at least :frown:
2018-12-09 20:14:24	+jan6	ALL official google phones are, afaik
2018-12-09 20:14:28	~ben	i had a look at the pixel 3 when i was at best buy earlier this week
2018-12-09 20:14:29	+jan6	nexuses too
2018-12-09 20:14:31	~ben	looked nice
2018-12-09 20:14:32	~deepend	i was concidering a pixel but didn't since the s9 was on sale.. so got pulled in that direction because im cheap
2018-12-09 20:14:48	~ben	tbh grab the 2xl if it's cheap enough
2018-12-09 20:14:51	+jan6	protip: avoid samsung, when possible
2018-12-09 20:15:00	~ben	yeah no thanks
2018-12-09 20:15:07	+jan6	they're basically the apple of android
2018-12-09 20:15:18	~deepend	yup they seem to be
2018-12-09 20:15:31	ahriman	i hate samsung
2018-12-09 20:15:32	~deepend	which sucks because I moved from apple to get away from apple lol
2018-12-09 20:15:36	+jan6	locking down everything, adding extra security and features nobody asked for, and stuff
2018-12-09 20:15:41	~ben	i was always confused when people asked do you have an apple or a samsung
2018-12-09 20:15:47	+jan6	lol
2018-12-09 20:15:51	~ben	i hate apple more than i hate samsung
2018-12-09 20:15:56	~deepend	^^
2018-12-09 20:16:00	ahriman	same
2018-12-09 20:16:07	+jan6	try to tell them you have a motorola and see their face ;P
2018-12-09 20:16:21	~ben	i wish the pixel wasn't a google phone and spying on me cause it's a really great phone
2018-12-09 20:16:26	+jan6	RIP motorola
2018-12-09 20:16:32	+jan6	lol
2018-12-09 20:16:37	~ben	i had a moto x 2nd gen for a wihle
2018-12-09 20:16:37	+jan6	custom roms ftw
2018-12-09 20:16:40	~ben	that was a great phone
2018-12-09 20:17:20	+jan6	if you have an unlocked bootloader, there's literally no reason NOT to make a backup, and put a custom rom on there, or even make your own
2018-12-09 20:18:00	+jan6	even if you just replace google services with MicroG and GPlay with Yelp Store and stuff
2018-12-09 20:18:12	+jan6	s/Ye/Ya/
2018-12-09 20:18:13	sedbot	<jan6> even if you just replace google services with MicroG and GPlay with Yalp Store and stuff
2018-12-09 20:18:17	~deepend	i'd be all over a custom rom if that was an option
2018-12-09 20:18:34	+jan6	all you need is an unlocked bootloader
2018-12-09 20:19:01	+jan6	and a phone that's either really popular, or a few months old
2018-12-09 20:19:30	rnelson	I just got a Note 9 and am quite happy with it. That said, I came from a string of iPhones.
2018-12-09 20:20:46	ahriman	it's definitely better than being on an iphone
2018-12-09 20:20:48	~ben	it's better than an iphone for sure
2018-12-09 20:21:02	ahriman	though the note 9, isnt that the huge one?
2018-12-09 20:21:25	+jan6	https://download.lineageos.org/ has a list of "kool kid's fones", and xda has random people's custom roms for a ton more than mentioned there
2018-12-09 20:21:26	TildeBot	LineageOS Downloads https://bhh.sh/2gh
2018-12-09 20:21:30	rnelson	Yep, gigantic (compared to the 6S it replaced)
2018-12-09 20:21:57	~deepend	nowhere I go lists my model as supported.. they list other variations of this phone but not the one I have
2018-12-09 20:22:18	+jan6	main thing to check is the chipset
2018-12-09 20:22:46	~deepend	last place I was looking literally listed my phone model as specifically not supported
2018-12-09 20:22:53	+jan6	if the chipset it the same, then it's probably ok (try to see if anyone has confirmed it)
2018-12-09 20:22:55	rnelson	My wife got an S9 about 6 weeks ago (replacing an iPhone as well). Very happy with hers, but hates how large my Note is
2018-12-09 20:23:00	+jan6	but that's the same for me, basically
2018-12-09 20:23:35	+jan6	there are multiple years of the same name, AND 3g/4g have different boards, soooooo yeaaahh
2018-12-09 20:23:39	~ben	i've switched between big and small phones the last few that i've had
2018-12-09 20:23:44	ahriman	rnelson i don't think I could deal with a phone that big! i have small pockets
2018-12-09 20:23:48	+jan6	plus I don't have unlocked bootloader anymore
2018-12-09 20:23:56	~ben	moto x -> nexus 6 -> pixl 1 -> pixel 2 xl
2018-12-09 20:24:10	+jan6	nintendo switch phone when?
2018-12-09 20:24:17	~ben	probably going back to a small phone next
2018-12-09 20:24:29	~ben	but i'll keep this one til it dies i think
2018-12-09 20:24:45	~ben	razer makes phones now
2018-12-09 20:24:47	ahriman	im gonna keep my HTC One a9 until it dies
2018-12-09 20:25:01	~deepend	i just dont like all the crap software samsung tries to force down your throat..

2018-12-09 20:31:38	+jan6	ouch?
2018-12-09 20:31:42	ben1	and sshd set up on each of my machines so i can connect between them

2018-12-09 20:33:23	ben1	yeah i changed the password and disabled password auth
2018-12-09 20:33:55	+jan6	I'd definitely disable ssh as pi@pi, because y'know, defaults...why would you NOT make some other user for it?

2018-12-09 23:41:45	~tomasino	theoretically, it's not too hard
2018-12-09 23:42:11	~tomasino	i don't use chrome much anymore, though
2018-12-09 23:42:17	~tomasino	i should port this over so i can use it on FF
2018-12-09 23:42:42	~ben	fix that on the way i suppose
2018-12-09 23:43:04	~ben	how much work is it to maintain ff and chrome support?
2018-12-09 23:44:13	~tomasino	no clue
2018-12-09 23:44:14	TildeBot	no u infinity tomasino
2018-12-09 23:44:24	~ben	lol me either
2018-12-09 23:44:26	~tomasino	fF used to be totally different, but now their plugin syntax is very close
2018-12-09 23:44:30	~ben	i've never written a browser extension
2018-12-09 23:44:35	~ben	yeah it's webextension now or something
2018-12-09 23:44:37	~tomasino	i'm using chrome-sync to save settings and sync them
2018-12-09 23:44:46	~tomasino	i think webextensions are built off that same principle
2018-12-09 23:44:59	~tomasino	it'll be a nice thing to explore, and if I can get a few bucks out of it, awesome
2018-12-09 23:45:03	~ben	i'm not familiar with chrome-sync
2018-12-09 23:45:21	~tomasino	extensions can save settings and sync them between browsers if you "log in" to your browser
2018-12-09 23:45:26	~ben	ohhh ok
2018-12-09 23:45:26	~tomasino	firefox and chrome both offer it now
2018-12-09 23:45:36	~tomasino	not only do the plugins sync, but the settings can too
2018-12-09 23:45:41	~ben	i didn't realize that ff synced plugin settings
2018-12-09 23:45:47	~tomasino	it won't by default
2018-12-09 23:45:53	~tomasino	the plugin has to code it to do that
2018-12-09 23:45:58	~ben	oh ok that makes sense
2018-12-09 23:46:08	~tomasino	i've always been very sad that stylish never bothered
2018-12-09 23:46:16	~ben	stylish is Bad
2018-12-09 23:46:17	~tomasino	it's not particularly hard
2018-12-09 23:46:21	~ben	stylus is the one
2018-12-09 23:46:26	~ben	it might
2018-12-09 23:46:29	~tomasino	yeah, stylus
2018-12-09 23:46:32	~tomasino	same difference. ;)
2018-12-09 23:46:37	~tomasino	i've got stylus installed currently
2018-12-09 23:46:43	~tomasino	and same thing... no settings sync
2018-12-09 23:46:45	~ben	lol one steals your browsing data
2018-12-09 23:47:02	~ben	i kept the exported json in my syncthing
2018-12-09 23:47:06	~tomasino	the biggest issue with read is that it was originally built on the readability API
2018-12-09 23:47:08	~ben	but now i just use darkreader
2018-12-09 23:47:08	~tomasino	then that went away
2018-12-09 23:47:20	~tomasino	so i had to switch to a different thing, and it piggybacks off heroku, and it's slow
2018-12-09 23:47:24	~tomasino	i should do client-side parsing
2018-12-09 23:47:29	~tomasino	but i don't want to rewrite that whole part
2018-12-09 23:47:54	~tomasino	you can highlight content and right-click to speed read it, or you can click the plugin icon and it'll auto-parse the page
2018-12-09 23:48:03	~tomasino	that autoparsing part is offloaded to a webservice currently
2018-12-09 23:48:16	~tomasino	there are node packages that can do it now, but i'm not sure how well they work in-browser
2018-12-09 23:48:25	~ben	that should be doable in-browser
2018-12-09 23:48:25	~tomasino	and i've not bothered looking into it since it still works fine
2018-12-09 23:48:40	~tomasino	but yeah, for portability and speed, it should stay local
2018-12-09 23:48:44	~tomasino	and it'll work offline too
2018-12-09 23:48:52	~tomasino	and then i can make it portable to FF and everyone will be happy
2018-12-09 23:48:58	~ben	yeah for sure
2018-12-09 23:48:59	~tomasino	oh, and I can get rid of the jquery UI crap too
2018-12-09 23:49:04	~ben	heroku is pretty slow anyways
2018-12-09 23:49:16	~tomasino	i let a co-worker build the settings panel and he added a bunch of dependencies
2018-12-09 23:49:18	~ben	keep it vanilla?
2018-12-09 23:49:19	~tomasino	i hate dependencies
2018-12-09 23:49:21	~tomasino	yeah
2018-12-09 23:49:26	~tomasino	other people's code is the devil
2018-12-09 23:49:28	~ben	ohhh yeah don't add deps if you don't need it

2018-12-10 04:16:32	login	Hey, can I flood this chat with discussion about an economics experiment I went to today?
2018-12-10 04:16:42	login	Well, I hope to have a dicussion and not flood...
2018-12-10 04:16:55	login	Would just like to know things like what would you have done in this situation and why
2018-12-10 04:17:12	~ben	huh?
2018-12-10 04:18:09	~ben	what situation?
2018-12-10 04:22:04	login	the situation presented in the economics experiment
2018-12-10 04:22:59	~ben	lol that doesn't help me at all
2018-12-10 04:30:03	npa	like login presents a situation where you make an economic choice
2018-12-10 04:30:14	npa	idk
2018-12-10 04:30:24	~ben	still hasn't done so
2018-12-10 04:34:46	robdrake	Oy
2018-12-10 04:35:13	robdrake	Sorry I haven't been on, got sucked into a SteamOS game, Stash
2018-12-10 04:35:48	robdrake	Ozzy Osbourne's "Flying High Again" in going in my head
2018-12-10 04:37:49	~ben	oh hey wb robdrake 
2018-12-10 04:37:59	~ben	what kind of game is that?
2018-12-10 04:38:23	robdrake	Turn Based MMORPG
2018-12-10 04:38:48	robdrake	I like the turn based part, bio breaks outside of combat are no problem
2018-12-10 04:39:32	npa	i wanna play divinity original sin
2018-12-10 04:40:30	robdrake	Not going on a soapbox, but in my current mental state, that title just sounds wrong
2018-12-10 04:42:09	robdrake	I tend to get sucked into MMORPGs,  Everquest, Dungeons & 
2018-12-10 04:42:14	robdrake	Dragons online
2018-12-10 04:42:31	robdrake	World of Warcraft was too expensive to suck me in
2018-12-10 04:42:46	login	oh well, so the game was as follows.
2018-12-10 04:43:09	login	All the participants were given Task 1 and Task 2.
2018-12-10 04:43:28	login	We didn't know what Task 2 was before Task 1, but we knew doing well in Task 1 will increase our chances of earning more money in Task 2.
2018-12-10 04:43:54	login	In Task 1, we were asked to add five two-digit positive integers by hand (no calculator allowed, only scrap paper)
2018-12-10 04:44:06	login	For each correct answer, we received 1 point.
2018-12-10 04:44:13	login	We were given 5 minutes.
2018-12-10 04:44:30	login	I solved 9 in 5 minutes. How many would you have solved?
2018-12-10 04:44:44	login	And what tricks would you have used?
2018-12-10 04:45:15	~ben	so you're wondering about mental math tricks?
2018-12-10 04:45:25	login	Well, that was just the first part.
2018-12-10 04:45:43	~ben	i group as many 1s digits into 10s as i can
2018-12-10 04:45:52	login	It was essentially a way to separate all the players by skill..
2018-12-10 04:46:04	login	ben: I tried doing that at first too, but it was too slow...
2018-12-10 04:46:26	robdrake	Fast and Accurate, or Accurate?
2018-12-10 04:46:29	login	But eventual pattern became writing each two digit number as <multiple of 10> + <number>
2018-12-10 04:46:40	login	robdrake: fast and accurate... you get 0 points for that question if your answer was wrong...
2018-12-10 04:47:02	~ben	so what's the twist
2018-12-10 04:47:09	~ben	of course you would solve as many as you can
2018-12-10 04:47:17	login	Yeah, I was able to solve 9 in five minutes...
2018-12-10 04:47:19	robdrake	I could be accurate right now, but not fast, and that is only if I can keep my mind focused on 1 task now
2018-12-10 04:47:41	login	We had scraps of paper, and I think many went full mental without using paper to do it...
2018-12-10 04:47:52	login	The usual method would be adding all the one's digits and carrying over...
2018-12-10 04:47:54	robdrake	IRC is 1/2 a task
2018-12-10 04:48:04	robdrake	yeah
2018-12-10 04:48:07	login	My eventual idea was to make 49 50-1 instead of 40+9
2018-12-10 04:48:30	login	So the one's digit calculation was smaller, and the ten's digit calculation was essentially adding 5 one digit numbers
2018-12-10 04:48:41	login	so there I grouped them into 10s like ben said
2018-12-10 04:49:04	~ben	huh i'm curious how i would do
2018-12-10 04:49:07	login	So 40+60 would be grouped...
2018-12-10 04:49:15	login	So then, Task 2 was the following:
2018-12-10 04:49:34	login	All the participants were randomly selected into groups of 8.
2018-12-10 04:49:50	login	4 men and 4 women in each group.
2018-12-10 04:50:16	login	We got $5 for doing the first part...
2018-12-10 04:50:22	login	meaning Task 1.
2018-12-10 04:50:44	login	We also got $5 for just being there for Task 2...
2018-12-10 04:50:55	login	So on top of the $10, here's how things worked:
2018-12-10 04:51:16	login	So each group of 8 was to be selected into two firms (4 employees each)
2018-12-10 04:51:24	login	Each firm had 2 "managers" and 2 workers.
2018-12-10 04:51:39	login	The managers got $20, and workers got $10.
2018-12-10 04:51:49	login	We didn't have to do anything, just apply based on our performance in Task 1.
2018-12-10 04:52:03	robdrake	brb
2018-12-10 04:52:14	login	So the best-performing at Task 1 would become managers, and the others would become "workers"
2018-12-10 04:52:43	login	Since there were 8 in a group, and 4 managerial posts, there would be 4 people with $20 and 4 with $10.
2018-12-10 04:52:46	login	.
2018-12-10 04:53:23	login	But the way the managers were chosen was different for Firm 1 and Firm 2.
2018-12-10 04:53:43	login	In Firm 1 (no quota): The two best performers from the group were given offers to be managers.
2018-12-10 04:54:11	login	In Firm 2 (quota): One managerial post was given to the best female performer (compared to other women in the group).
2018-12-10 04:54:34	login	The other managerial post was given to the best performer from the remaining
2018-12-10 04:55:23	~ben	how'd the demographics split end up?
2018-12-10 04:55:59	npa	were you a manager login
2018-12-10 04:56:02	login	no
2018-12-10 04:56:02	TildeBot	no u infinity login
2018-12-10 04:56:13	login	i ended up being a worker for Firm 1
2018-12-10 04:56:15	npa	earning those beacoup bucks
2018-12-10 04:56:24	login	beacoup?
2018-12-10 04:56:30	~ben	from franch
2018-12-10 04:56:30	npa	beaucoup
2018-12-10 04:56:32	~ben	beaucoup
2018-12-10 04:56:32	npa	idk
2018-12-10 04:56:35	npa	franch, exactly
2018-12-10 04:56:38	~ben	lmao
2018-12-10 04:56:56	login	So anyway, there was a twist
2018-12-10 04:56:57	~ben	it's a saying
2018-12-10 04:57:04	npa	it means a lot
2018-12-10 04:57:07	~ben	what's the twist
2018-12-10 04:57:07	npa	i think, idk
2018-12-10 04:57:08	login	The twist was, we had to answer two questions.
2018-12-10 04:57:18	login	If we got manager offers from both firms, which firm would we choose?
2018-12-10 04:57:25	npa	who earned the most
2018-12-10 04:57:39	login	The answer was binding, and if we actually got offers from both firms, we'd get chosen into the firm that we answered we'd go to
2018-12-10 04:57:43	~ben	i'd take the higher paying offer
2018-12-10 04:57:46	login	npa: both firms offered 20
2018-12-10 04:57:50	login	for managers
2018-12-10 04:57:57	npa	b.s. i want proportional pay to my ability
2018-12-10 04:58:02	npa	i want stock options
2018-12-10 04:58:25	login	You just had to be good at adding five two-digit numbers really quickly and accurately.
2018-12-10 04:58:44	login	So the first question was that.
2018-12-10 04:59:06	login	Also, and I forgot to mention this earlier, they allowed us to choose one firm to which we could send an "improved" performance score
2018-12-10 04:59:11	~ben	and the only difference is a "diversity quota" between the firms?
2018-12-10 04:59:15	npa	i think i'd pick the second
2018-12-10 04:59:26	npa	actually, depends
2018-12-10 04:59:28	login	We'd get an additional minute to add five two-digit numbers, and we'd be able to send our "improved" score
2018-12-10 04:59:35	login	but only to the firm we chose
2018-12-10 04:59:35	npa	whatever results in the more skilled person being a worker
2018-12-10 04:59:57	login	Well, the aim was to become manager to get $20 instead of $10
2018-12-10 05:00:12	login	The manager and worker stuff is just a way to phrase the problem...
2018-12-10 05:00:22	login	So the second question:
2018-12-10 05:00:37	login	Which firm would you like to work "extra hard" for, and be able to send the improved score to?
2018-12-10 05:00:55	login	So again, there were 8 in my group. 4 men, 4 women (this was chosen).
2018-12-10 05:01:21	login	4 would become managers, 4 would become workers.
2018-12-10 05:01:34	login	Firm 1 had two managers, Firm 2 had two managers.
2018-12-10 05:01:45	login	Firm 1: no quota. Firm 2: 1 woman quota, the other one with no quota.
2018-12-10 05:01:58	login	I had to decide which firm to choose if i got both firms, and which firm to work extra hard for.
2018-12-10 05:02:54	login	The extra hard would mean sending an improved score (by doing one more minute) (and the score wasn't normalised to five minutes... All the ones who didn't work for 6 minutes would only submit their 5-minute scores compared to those who worked the extra minute)
2018-12-10 05:03:08	login	So I had to think
2018-12-10 05:03:17	login	Which options would give me the best chance to become a manager?
2018-12-10 05:03:36	~ben	so it's a test of gender bias and affirmative action?
2018-12-10 05:03:39	login	Yeah
2018-12-10 05:03:52	login	Actually, after this was done.
2018-12-10 05:04:00	login	They asked four more questions
2018-12-10 05:04:12	login	If you got the answer right to within +/-1, you'd get $1 more.
2018-12-10 05:04:17	login	The questions wer:
2018-12-10 05:04:33	login	1. What do you think was the average score for the male participants?
2018-12-10 05:04:42	login	2. What do you think was the average score for the female participants?
2018-12-10 05:04:52	login	3. What do you think the highest score was for the male participants?
2018-12-10 05:05:29	login	4. What do you think was the highest score for female participants?
2018-12-10 05:05:45	login	I think they asked about average score and average manager's score
2018-12-10 05:05:48	login	Not highest
2018-12-10 05:06:18	login	So 3 and 4 were, what do you think the average score was for male managers
2018-12-10 05:06:27	login	(and female managers in q4)
2018-12-10 05:06:30	login	And q5
2018-12-10 05:06:34	login	(i think there were 5 questions)
2018-12-10 05:06:43	login	How many do you think you answered correctly in Task 1.
2018-12-10 05:06:59	login	(if one kept track on a piece of paper, then one would almost certainly get this one right)
2018-12-10 05:07:11	~ben	huh i'm really curious to see how the results came out
2018-12-10 05:07:15	login	Then, they offered a gambling proposition
2018-12-10 05:07:31	login	I think to test for people's risk tolerance
2018-12-10 05:07:45	login	So they offered a head/tail thing
2018-12-10 05:08:01	login	5 ED = $1
2018-12-10 05:08:17	login	Option 1: Head (28 ED), Tail (28 ED)
2018-12-10 05:08:32	login	Option 2: Head (24 ED), Tail (36 ED)
2018-12-10 05:08:58	login	Option 3: Head (20 ED), Tail (44 ED)
2018-12-10 05:09:18	login	Option 4: Head (16 ED), Tail (52 ED)
2018-12-10 05:09:29	login	Option 5: Head (12 ED), Tail (60 ED)
2018-12-10 05:09:43	login	Option 6: Head (2 ED), Tail (70 ED)
2018-12-10 05:10:01	login	So my idea was to look at expected value, and choose the one with the least variance that had the best expected value
2018-12-10 05:10:09	login	So option 5 is what I chose to gamble on
2018-12-10 05:10:23	login	$2.4 if i lose, $12 if i win
2018-12-10 05:10:50	login	So then, the experimenter actually flipped a coin in front of all of us and shows us that it was "Tails"
2018-12-10 05:12:47	<--	jack3 (the_kink@pool-71-255-179-124.slsbmd.east.verizon.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
2018-12-10 05:13:20	robdrake	drat
2018-12-10 05:13:22	login	Then, we had to give our comments on why we answered the way we did in Task 2 (which was just answering two questions, after which we did the addition task for one additional minute)
2018-12-10 05:13:34	login	Then, we collected our payment.
2018-12-10 05:13:47	login	So I'd like to put the question to you
2018-12-10 05:13:53	login	Which firm would you choose if you had an offer from both firms?
2018-12-10 05:14:14	login	And, which firm would you give your extra-minute points to?
2018-12-10 05:14:31	login	Firm 1 (no quota): 2 managers.
2018-12-10 05:14:51	login	Firm 2 (quota): 1 female manager, 1 manager of any gender
2018-12-10 05:15:42	login	Also, if one declined the offer (by virtue of their answer to Question 1: which firm would you choose if you got an offer from both), the next best performer would get the offer..
2018-12-10 05:15:53	login	in case of the quota person, the next best female performer would get the offer..
2018-12-10 05:16:33	~ben	my first instinct would be to pick firm 2 since they're displaying more progressive views by having an affirmative action quota. i'm going off this because i think i'd fit in with the culture there
2018-12-10 05:16:50	~ben	but if i'm going on winning the game, i'd go for firm 1 cause i'm a male and i'm aware of the privilege i have there
2018-12-10 05:17:27	login	Wouldn't you think that if all the males think like that, and choose firm 1, you'd have a better chance of making it at firm 2?
2018-12-10 05:18:16	login	Also, ben: is your answer about choosing which firm if you got both offers, or which firm to give the extra minute to?
2018-12-10 05:18:41	~ben	probably both
2018-12-10 05:18:54	~ben	i'm not accounting for the meta-game
2018-12-10 05:19:01	login	Ah yeah, but the meta-game is the real game...
2018-12-10 05:19:09	login	What do you think the other 8 will do?
2018-12-10 05:19:16	login	What will the 4 men and 4 women do?
2018-12-10 05:19:25	login	I think it's safe to say all 4 women will choose firm 2 for both options...
2018-12-10 05:19:32	login	Because they'd have to compete with 4 people instead of 8
2018-12-10 05:19:34	~ben	i don't think it's safe to say that at all
2018-12-10 05:20:09	login	No? Why would you choose firm 1 economically speaking if there was a quota for you in firm 2?
2018-12-10 05:20:13	~ben	playing the meta-game doesn't get accurate information for what they're looking for
2018-12-10 05:20:21	~ben	not necessarily
2018-12-10 05:20:34	login	They're looking for the economic effects of offering quotas...
2018-12-10 05:20:55	login	Well, define "accurate"...
2018-12-10 05:21:11	login	I mean, it would be accurate to say that some would play the meta game and make choices based on that, while others wouldn't.
2018-12-10 05:22:16	login	They also gave us a "control question" before Task 2
2018-12-10 05:22:23	login	which we had to answer on paper...
2018-12-10 05:22:49	login	I thought it was the same example for everybody, but now i think that they gave different control questions
2018-12-10 05:23:32	login	Perhaps one example showed women being better off putting their extra-minute in firm 2... while the other one showed the opposite
2018-12-10 05:23:49	login	In my "control question", i was given an example of eight participants with their scores and decisions
2018-12-10 05:23:56	login	and had to answer questions and hypotheticals
2018-12-10 05:24:10	login	So what if this candidate had done this instead, would they be a manager or a worker?
2018-12-10 05:24:42	login	In my question, the woman candidate who had 9 points and 2 extra-minute points, would get selected as a manager in either firm
2018-12-10 05:25:43	login	While the woman candidate who got selected into the quota would be a worker if she had chosen to put her extra-minute in firm 1
2018-12-10 05:26:09	login	The best woman candidate in my given example chose firm 1 for both answers, and would have become a manager in either firm
2018-12-10 05:26:21	login	The best male candidate was better than the best woman candidate in my example
2018-12-10 05:27:00	login	When I say "my example", I don't mean the actual way the experiment ran, but instead, the example they had provided and asked us to answer questions about to check that we indeed understood how it worked.
2018-12-10 05:28:36	login	So ben, meta-game wise, how would you play?
2018-12-10 05:28:54	login	Would you predict better chances pushing for firm 1 or firm 2?
2018-12-10 05:29:03	login	The answer depends on what you think others chose for question 1
2018-12-10 05:29:29	login	If all the women chose firm 2 for both answers, and the top 2 male candidates chose firm 1 for question 2. your best bet is to choose firm 2
2018-12-10 05:29:36	login	(for question 2)
2018-12-10 05:29:44	~ben	i'm not sure
2018-12-10 05:29:53	login	I choose Firm 2 for both too lol
2018-12-10 05:30:00	~ben	yeah i probably would
2018-12-10 05:30:15	login	I think my best bet would have been to work harder for firm 1 though
2018-12-10 05:30:45	login	I think the male candidates would have thought culture-wise and chosen Firm 2 (including the best two in my group, i didn't know who they were though)
2018-12-10 05:31:01	login	And would work harder for firm 2
2018-12-10 05:31:07	login	So I should have chosen to work harder for firm 1
2018-12-10 05:31:20	login	My final result was being a worker for firm 1, so I was not even in the top 50%
2018-12-10 05:31:32	login	And I had 9 correct for firm 1, and 11 correct for firm 2
2018-12-10 05:31:42	login	I think the best male candidate chose firm 2, displacing all the other male candidates
2018-12-10 05:31:54	login	So second and third best went to firm 1
2018-12-10 05:32:01	login	it also depends on how the 4 women did
2018-12-10 05:32:17	login	One would get selected by quota, so the other three would compete with the rest 6
2018-12-10 05:32:25	login	I mean the rest 4
2018-12-10 05:32:33	login	So out of these 7 people
2018-12-10 05:32:51	login	There was more room for men in firm 1, and only one position for men in firm 2
2018-12-10 05:33:06	login	So the ideal option would be to work harder for firm 1 rather than firm 2
2018-12-10 05:33:25	login	I mean, this would also show up in rental markets right?
2018-12-10 05:33:38	login	Many are female-only accommodation, so how would rental prices be affected?
2018-12-10 05:33:55	login	I think they would be less because the market is smaller for female-only accommodation compared to anybody allowed accommodaiton
2018-12-10 05:34:15	login	I don't think any woman candidate should prefer firm 1 over firm 2.
2018-12-10 05:34:23	login	Chances are *always* better in firm 2 for women.
2018-12-10 05:34:41	login	Because only compete with 4 for one position, and the rest for second position
2018-12-10 05:35:18	login	.
2018-12-10 05:35:56	login	Their demographic questions also included (other than age, country in which parents were born, nationality, parent's education etc.)
2018-12-10 05:37:06	login	it included questions like "Choose whether you strongly agree, agree, are neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree with the following questions"
2018-12-10 05:38:00	login	1. Women and men are equal in <country> (where <country> is where i live and went for the experiment)
2018-12-10 05:38:39	login	2. More representation for women in <country's> parliament would be better.
2018-12-10 05:38:48	login	3. Women should only work if it's necessary.
2018-12-10 05:39:05	login	4. Women should make most of the decisions on how to bring up a child
2018-12-10 05:39:08	login	Things like that...
2018-12-10 05:39:26	login	Just things gauging one's baseline level of preferences
2018-12-10 05:39:29	login	and beliefs
2018-12-10 05:39:41	login	They'll probably check if it correlates with whether they chose firm 2 or firm 1
2018-12-10 05:39:55	login	I did well on the gambling portion
2018-12-10 05:40:03	login	Won 60 ED ($12)
2018-12-10 05:40:06	login	Became worker
2018-12-10 05:40:09	login	$10
2018-12-10 05:40:21	login	Answered the question gauging my own score correct ($1)
2018-12-10 05:40:37	login	didn't get any of the 'average' participant or 'average' worker questions correct...
2018-12-10 05:41:02	login	I mean, getting those correct would mean being smart enough to know which firm to choose based on averages
2018-12-10 05:41:32	login	So all in all, $10 for participation, $10 for worker, $1 for correct answer to question, and $12 on gambling
2018-12-10 05:41:37	login	$33 in total
2018-12-10 05:42:11	login	If I had chosen the no-risk gambling position (which is what any investment firm would tell you to choose, because volitility is death in investment)
2018-12-10 05:42:38	login	but this was one-shot, so there was no question of repeatedly making decisions
2018-12-10 05:43:22	login	But anyway, if I had chosen the normal 28 ED option, I'd get $5.6 instead of $12
2018-12-10 05:43:39	login	I would have much preferred being a manager though
2018-12-10 05:44:01	login	And choosing Option 6 for gambling (same expected value, more variance) would have just been too risky without increased payoff
2018-12-10 05:45:07	login	Alright, #meta flooding over.

2018-12-10 10:10:58	npa	ok i have a question
2018-12-10 10:11:58	npa	my housemate has a habit of eating my food, yet she does not like to be told off for it
2018-12-10 10:12:10	npa	i mean, that's pretty normal behaviour
2018-12-10 10:13:24	npa	but she has taken some of my cake, and i have proof of it, i just don't know whether i could really be bothered to pester her about it
2018-12-10 10:14:12	npa	oh, when i say normal behaviour that's in reference to feeling hurt over being discovered
2018-12-10 10:15:08	npa	will telling her off improve her ways (i.e. stop taking things without permission) or just get her to try and be more sneaky about it?
2018-12-10 10:23:36	epicmorphism	just spit in all of your food i do it all the time
2018-12-10 10:25:42	npa	lmao
2018-12-10 10:26:02	npa	well, it's either telling her off or being more defensive about my food
2018-12-10 10:48:45	~tomasino	casually mention that "I noticed some of our food is gone. That reminds me, have you seen our toothbrush?"

2018-12-10 11:03:09	epicmorphism	lol tomasino 
2018-12-10 11:10:36	npa	do you share toothbrushes tomasino 
2018-12-10 11:40:38	+jan6	easy way, "poison" specific sectors of your food with something like strong laxatives, and specifically tell her to not eat it ;P
2018-12-10 11:41:10	+jan6	not much actual damage, just REALLY unpleasant
2018-12-10 11:54:40	npa	i feel like i shouldn't need to constantly tell her to stop touching it
2018-12-10 12:25:37	epicmorphism	npa: yeah its prolly annoying as fuck

2018-12-10 15:25:58	~ben	might need to be in i-lines
2018-12-10 15:26:30	~ben	or drop it in a different file and just include it in the main gophermap

2018-12-10 16:19:10	mushmouth	how you guys doing?
2018-12-10 16:19:57	mushmouth	someone like tom should write a better tutorial on gopher mapping and such
2018-12-10 16:20:09	mushmouth	just seeing ben link to github

2018-12-10 16:25:24	@cmccabe	is there difference in gophermap structure for different gopher servers?
2018-12-10 16:26:48	mushmouth	yes cmccabe 
2018-12-10 16:27:31	~ben	gophernicus is one of the more permissive gopherds
2018-12-10 16:28:29	@cmccabe	is gophernicus the most common gopherd these days?
2018-12-10 16:28:35	~ben	probably?
2018-12-10 16:28:39	~ben	i'm not sure really
2018-12-10 16:28:44	mushmouth	i don't think so
2018-12-10 16:28:57	~ben	there's pygopherd, motsognir, and a handful of others
2018-12-10 16:29:06	~ben	which one is the most common then?
2018-12-10 16:29:11	mushmouth	but due to how small the gopher market is it probably hard to figure out
2018-12-10 16:29:21	~ben	it's very niche
2018-12-10 16:29:36	mushmouth	little documentation
2018-12-10 16:29:44	mushmouth	beside a few sites that pop up recently
2018-12-10 16:29:47	mushmouth	like gopher.zone
2018-12-10 16:30:55	mushmouth	like i run pygopherd persoanlly
2018-12-10 16:30:57	kirch	I got gophernicus running... now to fix gophermap to make it work right
2018-12-10 16:31:01	mushmouth	i know tom runs motsognir
2018-12-10 16:31:07	mushmouth	i know sdf runs gophernicus
2018-12-10 16:31:09	kirch	pygopherd is nice - but it's html portal needs re-written

2018-12-10 16:31:26	~ben	sdf's gophernicus is super out of date
2018-12-10 16:31:27	mushmouth	kirch: if you re write it i'll run it
2018-12-10 16:31:36	mushmouth	im running pygohered for now
2018-12-10 16:31:43	kirch	also, no idea how pygfarm works - seems THAT would be better than patching it, but whatever
2018-12-10 16:31:57	mushmouth	patching is always more fun imo ^^
2018-12-10 16:32:18	kirch	there's no docs for pygopherd - or really any of this software
2018-12-10 16:32:33	mushmouth	that what i mean it's hard to find statstic or docs for anything really
2018-12-10 16:32:40	mushmouth	this is part of the web that you have to ask for
2018-12-10 16:33:00	kirch	gotta find the dev or people who've used it for years - and harass them into helping you

2018-12-10 17:03:46	mushmouth	im really uncertain
2018-12-10 17:08:03	~ben	what kind of action
2018-12-10 17:08:18	~ben	ban australians?
2018-12-10 17:08:21	~ben	:o
2018-12-10 17:12:45	mushmouth	yeah
2018-12-10 17:13:12	mushmouth	ben: do we have to ban australians because of it?
2018-12-10 17:13:37	~ben	what no
2018-12-10 17:14:09	mushmouth	by the way ben how would i recover my hashbang key and such?
2018-12-10 17:15:14	mushmouth	but now people pretending to be from australia government
2018-12-10 17:15:19	mushmouth	i think this is going to be really hard
2018-12-10 17:15:43	mushmouth	this bill bothers me
2018-12-10 17:16:23	~ben	so many bad bills going through
2018-12-10 17:16:48	~ben	did you lose your ssh key that you signed up with?
2018-12-10 17:17:47	mushmouth	ben: yeah
2018-12-10 17:17:52	mushmouth	i know the password i think
2018-12-10 17:17:59	mushmouth	actually no
2018-12-10 17:18:01	~ben	password to what?
2018-12-10 17:18:05	mushmouth	it should be on ~town shell account
2018-12-10 17:18:18	mushmouth	im having a hard time sshing to the server
2018-12-10 17:18:19	~ben	there's really no account recovery method
2018-12-10 17:18:42	mushmouth	my username on hashbang should simply just be "mushmouth"
2018-12-10 17:19:15	mushmouth	yeah there needs to be a better recovery method
2018-12-10 17:19:22	~ben	there will be with userdb
2018-12-10 17:19:31	~ben	whenever that goes out
2018-12-10 17:19:58	mushmouth	cause im trying to change my ssh key that i generated with hashbang program to my main one
2018-12-10 17:20:13	mushmouth	can i send you the key or something to let you know who i'm?
2018-12-10 17:20:28	~ben	are you able to log in?
2018-12-10 17:20:45	~ben	if you're able to log in, run sudo hashbangctl
2018-12-10 17:20:59	~ben	i wouldn't be able to do anything for you
2018-12-10 17:22:03	mushmouth	no user already exist sadly
2018-12-10 17:22:04	TildeBot	no u infinity mushmouth

2018-12-10 18:13:04	login	Also, if you're left hungry, then you bring it to her attention and tell her you can't predict when the food will get over, so she'll have to go shopping for the both of you half the time too... she wouldn't want to keep you hungry on a grocery-run too many times right?
2018-12-10 18:14:19	login	Appeal to her good nature (sincerely), and she will try to fulfill the ideal image of her that she would feel you have because of your kind words
2018-12-10 18:15:02	login	Asking or nagging her would be like making the following exchange: "You can eat my food", and in return, "You have to sit through and feel distressed from my continuous complaints."

2018-12-10 18:56:12	+aewens	cmccabe: I used that as a chat system back in highschool. Granted, my classmates were unaware that I could turn their personal network directories into shared user space at the time, so it wasn't a very productive conversation.

2018-12-10 18:57:59	+aewens	login: They used security through obscurity and hoped no one would manually mount network drives to access other user's folders.
2018-12-10 18:58:58	login	they didn't think users needed to be protected from each other
2018-12-10 18:59:03	+aewens	Essentially, when a user logged into their account it would auto-mount X:\users\<username>, and if you mounted that \users directory there was nothing stopping me from accessing the other users
2018-12-10 18:59:11	login	Imagine having to submit an assignment, and they say "someone mounted my drive and deleted it :("
2018-12-10 18:59:51	+aewens	login: Oh, I couldn't delete it. But I could make 100x directories each with 100x levels inside and hide their assignments inside there.
2018-12-10 19:01:15	login	They could use Windows search to traverse through them though, right?
2018-12-10 19:01:39	arne	waaa

2018-12-10 19:05:47	+aewens	arne: From a quick glance, I can see you're trying to import /fonts/stylesheet.css and the network isn't loading that file.
2018-12-10 19:05:48	arne	fun story: im using a nokia phonme
2018-12-10 19:06:10	+aewens	So that file either doesn't exist, was moved, or is empty.
2018-12-10 19:06:18	arne	it exists
2018-12-10 19:06:28	arne	1000.directory/fonts/stylesheet.css
2018-12-10 19:07:04	+aewens	If it's in a different directory than unkt.css, you'll want to use ../fonts instead of /fonts
2018-12-10 19:07:35	arne	doing the stylesheet in html worked
2018-12-10 19:07:55	+aewens	Or if the fonts directory is in the same directory as unkt.css, just drop the leading "/"?
2018-12-10 19:07:58	+aewens	Oh, that works too

2018-12-10 20:25:00	~tomasino	hey, has anyone built a tilde command-line wiki system yet?
2018-12-10 20:25:41	+jan6	idk, but why would there be a need to?
2018-12-10 20:25:55	~tomasino	to have a wiki that's accessible and editable in the shell
2018-12-10 20:26:28	~tomasino	I'm about to work on an FAQs thing for cosmic.voyage and i'd rather do it in a system that the users could also update and add to
2018-12-10 20:26:44	~tomasino	but i don't want to recreate the wheel if there's something else already in progress
2018-12-10 20:27:15	+jan6	it's editable already afaik
2018-12-10 20:27:24	~tomasino	what's editable?
2018-12-10 20:27:36	+jan6	I guess check ~town's wiki instead then
2018-12-10 20:27:47	~tomasino	no no, i don't want to mess with other tilde's wikis
2018-12-10 20:27:47	TildeBot	no u infinity tomasino

2018-12-10 20:28:03	~tomasino	i want to make one for my own tilde community, but command line based
2018-12-10 20:28:54	~tomasino	i meant "tilde command line wiki system" as in software someone in the tildeverse had written, not tildeverse content

2018-12-10 20:30:37	~tomasino	still web-oriented
2018-12-10 20:30:41	~tomasino	i'll be brewing my own, i guess
2018-12-10 20:30:53	+jan6	web oriented how?
2018-12-10 20:31:13	~tomasino	that link you just gave me generates a static website
2018-12-10 20:31:20	+jan6	you want to NOT be able to view the wiki from a browser?
2018-12-10 20:31:23	~tomasino	correct
2018-12-10 20:31:24	+jan6	wut
2018-12-10 20:31:31	~tomasino	command-line wiki
2018-12-10 20:31:48	+jan6	I guess it's not hard to convert that
2018-12-10 20:32:14	~tomasino	it has some aspects that are interesting, but the browsing is missing. 
2018-12-10 20:32:23	~tomasino	editing a command line wiki is pretty much just creating a shared folder
2018-12-10 20:32:32	~tomasino	browsing in a way that doesn't suck is the trick
2018-12-10 20:32:36	+jan6	eh, just make a man wrapper I guess
2018-12-10 20:32:46	+jan6	just standard unix manpages
2018-12-10 20:32:46	~tomasino	that's not a bad idea
2018-12-10 20:33:03	+jan6	they have kinda formatting too, and stuff
2018-12-10 20:33:04	~tomasino	it makes browsing very easy... though adding and editing got trickier for people without *roff skills
2018-12-10 20:33:14	~tomasino	good idea, i'll think on it
2018-12-10 20:33:16	arne	roff
2018-12-10 20:33:21	arne	i like troff
2018-12-10 20:33:22	+jan6	I guess make a markdown wrapper for it or something?

2018-12-10 20:33:30	+jan6	what roff?

2018-12-10 21:17:33	alexis	Ooh, that whole line was pretty solid.
2018-12-10 21:17:40	+jan6	you should test if it's actually made of tungsten, throw it in a fire ;P jk jk
2018-12-10 21:18:05	alexis	Which Tungsten? If it's a T3, look out for that slider - the flex they used to connect the screen had a tendency to get brittle and crack with age.
2018-12-10 21:23:32	alexis	I know the TX had an issue with brittle solder on the wake/sleep button, too, but I'm not sure if any of the Tungstens had the same problem. I'd guess some might, though.
2018-12-10 21:26:02	SinaCutie	o/
2018-12-10 21:50:11	mushmouth	alexis: e2 sorry
2018-12-10 21:53:04	alexis	I’d watch out for the wake/sleep button, yeah. I know on the TX they used a side-mount SMD tact switch without enough strain relief, and I wouldn’t be surprised if the E2 did the same given that their bodies appear identical.
2018-12-10 21:53:38	alexis	Probably best to open it up and check, and maybe add some silastic if it looks like it needs it. Failing that, I’d be super gentle with that button.

2018-12-10 23:57:56	~tomasino	if you want an account i just need a ssh pubkey so you can log in. You can create your own ship/outpost/colony/settlement, whatever. Then you write plain text (ending in .txt) messages as files. When ready to share them with the QEC relay, you run "log" and follow the prompts
2018-12-10 23:57:58	~tomasino	that's it!
2018-12-10 23:58:07	~tomasino	you can write any story you want

2018-12-10 23:58:21	~tomasino	so things might work different where you are
2018-12-10 23:59:04	~tomasino	there's a welcome email on cosmic.voyage when you log in that you can read with mutt or alpine that spells out more
2018-12-10 23:59:13	~tomasino	and you can join us in #cosmic to talk about things too

2018-12-11 00:15:32	~tomasino	go for it and share it around on social media
2018-12-11 00:15:37	~tomasino	i want more people to join and contribute
2018-12-11 00:16:05	~tomasino	we're averaging 0.05 load average
2018-12-11 00:16:10	~tomasino	i think we can scale a bit more
2018-12-11 00:20:06	mushmouth	tomasino: do you think opera like version 4 had gopher support?
2018-12-11 00:20:10	mushmouth	especially the mini one
2018-12-11 00:21:04	~tomasino	probably?
2018-12-11 00:21:11	~tomasino	firefox had it for the longest time
2018-12-11 00:21:27	~tomasino	but i never much cared for browser gopher support. it was always weirdly icon based and clunky feeling
2018-12-11 00:21:36	~tomasino	dark terms are where it's at
2018-12-11 00:21:39	mushmouth	on the wikipedia they say n/a
2018-12-11 00:22:26	~tomasino	i guess not, then
2018-12-11 00:26:11	mushmouth	there web pro for it

2018-12-11 05:53:21	fosslinux	does anyone know if it is possible in a virtualbox vm to connect to a wifi network DIRECTLY in the vm
2018-12-11 05:56:14	~deepend	do ya have a wifi card you can pass-through to the vm? 
2018-12-11 05:56:39	~ben	two wifi cards right?
2018-12-11 05:56:51	fosslinux	no just one
2018-12-11 05:56:51	TildeBot	no u infinity fosslinux
2018-12-11 05:56:59	fosslinux	i don't need it to be connected at the same time
2018-12-11 05:57:13	fosslinux	deepend: i have a wifi card...
2018-12-11 05:57:14	~deepend	never tried doing pass through with virtualbox but I think it does it.. 
2018-12-11 05:57:29	+jan6|	get a usb wifi dongle if you can't figure out internal one
2018-12-11 05:57:29	fosslinux	i tried bridged adapter but it still shows up as ethernet

2018-12-11 05:57:53	fosslinux	debian host, windows guest
2018-12-11 05:57:54	+jan6|	I did say that before ;p

2018-12-11 05:58:15	fosslinux	what vbox?
2018-12-11 05:58:36	+jan6|	?
2018-12-11 05:58:48	fosslinux	nvm
2018-12-11 06:00:43	+jan6|	usually you can pass through usb devices directly to all VMs, afaik, so it should work

2018-12-11 06:05:18	+jan6|	basically you need pci passthrough
2018-12-11 06:05:49	fosslinux	lol i did
2018-12-11 06:05:59	fosslinux	i googled for a while before asking here

2018-12-11 06:06:25	fosslinux	lol no
2018-12-11 06:06:34	~deepend	you wont be able to passthrough a card that is in use by the host system

2018-12-11 06:09:00	fosslinux	4. No lazy physical memory allocation. The host will preallocate the whole RAM required for the VM on startup (as we cannot catch physical hardware accesses to the physical memory).
2018-12-11 06:09:03	fosslinux	rip
2018-12-11 06:09:14	+jan6|	how could you NOT find that after hours, lol
2018-12-11 06:09:20	+jan6|	rip why
2018-12-11 06:09:55	fosslinux	lol not for hours
2018-12-11 06:10:10	fosslinux	rip because then i have less ram
2018-12-11 06:10:18	+jan6|	if you have 8gb mem, and make a 4gb VM then do you expect to be able to use 6gb of it on the host? lol
2018-12-11 06:10:26	+jan6|	swap
2018-12-11 06:10:31	fosslinux	no

2018-12-11 19:14:26	+jan6	I wonder if the list would become an irc alternative for casual chat, or something else, or just stay dead

2018-12-11 19:15:05	ahriman	some people don't do irc, hopefully it will attract those folks

2018-12-11 19:28:52	arne	apparently zig's concurrency makes no syscalls

2018-12-11 22:56:59	robdrake	mushmouth, if you get a chance, you should get a Solid POD at solid.tilde.team and put your anime list in the public folder
2018-12-11 22:58:27	+aewens	Speaking of Solid, what exactly do I do with it once I have an account on it?
2018-12-11 23:00:19	robdrake	what to do is whatever you want to share, share it
2018-12-11 23:00:51	+aewens	Also, solid.tilde.team deleted the account I made earlier today, is that normal?
2018-12-11 23:01:05	robdrake	when you log in, at the bottem should be a link to "Getting started with Solid and the Data Browser" and now it's live
2018-12-11 23:01:13	robdrake	recreate the account
2018-12-11 23:01:22	+aewens	I did, but is that normal?

2018-12-11 23:06:18	robdrake	yes, or redirected therea :/

2018-12-12 02:55:06	~tomasino	dell xps 13 
2018-12-12 02:55:16	ahriman	i recently started using byobu instead of tmux, it's super nice. though for a *long* time I used tmux, especially when I wasn't in X
2018-12-12 02:55:40	~tomasino	tmux defaults are pretty dumb, but i've customized the shit out of it

2018-12-12 19:48:48	ahriman	i haven't started the install process yet
2018-12-12 19:49:13	ahriman	ill probably do it tonight after work, so ill ponder fedora vs debian while im working
2018-12-12 19:49:15	~ben	debian testing is a lovely {desk,lap}top os
2018-12-12 19:49:27	+jan6	I always go for "netinstall expert mode" just to make sure it doesn't default to something unpleasant, quite easy tbh
2018-12-12 19:49:35	+jan6	yah, debian testing 4 lyfe
2018-12-12 19:49:53	ahriman	i always do minimal installs of linux because i generally don't want kde/gnome
2018-12-12 19:50:01	+jan6	^good idea
2018-12-12 19:50:24	+jan6	I mean, it's definitely a good idea to uncheck it in the installer
2018-12-12 19:50:39	ahriman	the main reason why i was leaning fedora is so i can have a RH-like environment that I use all the time
2018-12-12 19:50:40	arne	l
2018-12-12 19:50:53	+jan6	you'll save a CONSIDERABLE amount of space by avoiding the default "reccommended apps for this environment"

2018-12-12 19:53:18	sedbot	<arne> i think so
2018-12-12 19:53:42	+jan6	also it might be too new standart they use, or gcc specific stuff
2018-12-12 19:54:09	+jan6	also where'd you get the tcc?
2018-12-12 19:54:47	arne	edge/testing from alpine linux
2018-12-12 19:54:55	+jan6	what version is that?
2018-12-12 19:55:04	+jan6	proably doesn't matter that much but still
2018-12-12 19:55:36	arne	0.9.27-r1
2018-12-12 19:56:01	ahriman	y u use tcc and not gcc/llvm
2018-12-12 19:56:15	+jan6	also from the website "TCC is heading torward full ISOC99 compliance." so it might be one of those things unimplemented...or yeah, assuming some out-of-spec capabilities

2018-12-12 19:56:37	arne	i live for tcc
2018-12-12 19:56:42	+jan6	if avoiding gcc, then you can try the Big Bad Clang
2018-12-12 19:56:52	+jan6	tcc is real cool indeed
2018-12-12 19:57:04	+jan6	but sometimes you can't get what you want
2018-12-12 19:57:24	+jan6	also, y'know, it's not developed anymore that much

2018-12-12 20:01:44	arne	gives segfault?
2018-12-12 20:01:46	+jan6	depends what library you use too, arne, and what optimization
2018-12-12 20:02:06	+jan6	lol, no wonder it's smaller if it faults
2018-12-12 20:02:19	+jan6	also how tf can you mess up freaking LS

2018-12-12 20:07:09	+jan6	hmm...what about compiling gcc from sources using tcc, then using that to compile whatever? you might be able to tweak some conf while doing that too...
2018-12-12 20:07:30	+jan6	and of course it'll take some hours probably, lol
2018-12-12 20:07:43	arne	bah

2018-12-12 20:45:05	ahriman	there should be a c compiler called thicc
2018-12-12 20:45:15	ahriman	i might symlink gcc to thicc on my laptop
2018-12-12 20:45:56	+jan6	heh
2018-12-12 20:46:02	+jan6	fitting name
2018-12-12 20:47:19	ahriman	it's thicc doe
2018-12-12 20:49:00	kirch	is there like a deoptimize flag in gcc?
2018-12-12 20:49:14	kirch	alias thicc="gcc --deoptimize"
2018-12-12 20:49:17	ahriman	you can specify levels of optimization
2018-12-12 20:49:20	+jan6	'heh
2018-12-12 20:49:23	+jan6	-O0
2018-12-12 20:49:25	+jan6	?
2018-12-12 20:49:31	ahriman	checking
2018-12-12 20:49:43	kirch	like, negative amounts of optimization - make the app slower and shittier
2018-12-12 20:50:00	+jan6	you can't "deoptimize" but you can specify "debug build with explictly no optimization"
2018-12-12 20:50:25	+jan6	which leaves a lot of unneccesary stuff in there
2018-12-12 20:51:11	ahriman	look slike just don't specify an -O level
2018-12-12 20:51:20	ahriman	to not optimize the binary
2018-12-12 20:53:00	amcclure	is anyone here a Debian developer?

2018-12-12 20:55:33	~ben	#debian-devel on oftc is probably a good place to look

2018-12-13 01:32:51	hyperboredoubt	Maybe you've got it confused with atonal.

2018-12-13 07:37:45	fosslinux	lol why weren't you ahriman
2018-12-13 07:38:06	ahriman	fosslinux: i have been using either openbsd or freebsd on my laptop as my primary os for roughly five years

2018-12-13 07:38:55	ahriman	i wasn't using it, just BSD
2018-12-13 07:39:35	fosslinux	so not for five years.
2018-12-13 07:39:39	fosslinux	linux or bsd.

2018-12-13 07:40:03	fosslinux	ohhh
2018-12-13 07:40:08	fosslinux	i prefer linux over bsd
2018-12-13 07:40:17	ahriman	they both have their uses
2018-12-13 07:40:33	fosslinux	part of it tho is my ingrained linux habits
2018-12-13 07:40:42	fosslinux	it just "dosen't make sense" to me
2018-12-13 07:40:43	ahriman	for home use i was beginning to miss how little configuration it takes to make things work
2018-12-13 07:41:14	fosslinux	too true
2018-12-13 07:41:42	ahriman	bsd is like .... spend an hour on configuration, still doesn't work, head-desk, try again for 6 more hours, then it works

2018-12-13 15:45:30	+jan6	that's kinda true
2018-12-13 15:45:33	+jan6	but still
2018-12-13 15:45:51	+jan6	I'd prefer to not have to scroll through 50 past quoted messages
2018-12-13 15:46:18	~ben	did you read the lists.sr.ht link i sent
2018-12-13 15:47:09	+jan6	just finished
2018-12-13 15:47:22	+jan6	except for the wrapping, seems ok
2018-12-13 15:47:52	~ben	what about the wrapping
2018-12-13 15:48:13	 *	jan6 hates hard-wrapping, because there's no real way to undo it
2018-12-13 15:48:30	~ben	you're not meant to undo it
2018-12-13 15:49:19	+jan6	most limits are not comfortable for me, especially when using varying screen sizes
2018-12-13 15:50:20	+jan6	check any hard-wrapped file on a phone and you'll see one of the reasons I dislike them, either weird wrapping, or have to constantly scroll back and forth
2018-12-13 15:51:21	+jan6	on computers it's either same (like, 5 charactrs off of my screen resolution, for example), OR there's half the page empty (more common)
2018-12-13 15:51:45	~ben	sounds like your clients are configured improperly
2018-12-13 15:51:57	+jan6	you cannot configure it properly
2018-12-13 15:52:30	+jan6	it's literally impossible to do it properly, because it's impossible to undo properly
2018-12-13 15:53:13	+jan6	it's really easy to add hardwrapping on your end
2018-12-13 15:53:25	+jan6	impossible to remove it 
2018-12-13 15:54:35	+jan6	it's ok as a guideline, of "try to break line around that number", but not as an absolute limit
2018-12-13 15:56:06	erxeto	html in email hurts my tired eyes ...
2018-12-13 15:56:18	+jan6	that's possibly a valid case
2018-12-13 15:56:27	+jan6	except for me it's more the reverse
2018-12-13 15:56:28	~ben	it's not as bad as not-dark themes
2018-12-13 15:56:30	erxeto	well, I usually just delete html emails, as reading them is difficult in my MUA
2018-12-13 15:56:36	~ben	good call
2018-12-13 15:56:42	+jan6	but yeah, much easier to darktheme plaintext
2018-12-13 15:56:44	~ben	i usually do the same
2018-12-13 15:56:49	amcclure	I have the webmails for ~team and blinkenshell set to force txt only
2018-12-13 15:57:00	~ben	darkreader does a great job of darktheming the web tbh
2018-12-13 15:57:05	~ben	yeah same amcclure 
2018-12-13 15:57:10	~ben	plus thunderbird
2018-12-13 15:57:11	~ben	and mutt
2018-12-13 15:57:34	erxeto	but still, sometimes I need to read some email, still with w3m or something is painful, html in email is even more broken than on browsers
2018-12-13 15:58:07	+jan6	I wonder who tf popularised the idea of "hey, let's make it all BRIGHT WHITE so it draws more power and is harder to read!"
2018-12-13 15:58:12	~ben	i really dislike lists from mailchimp
2018-12-13 15:58:31	+jan6	I don't remember of ever hearing of such a place, lol
2018-12-13 15:58:32	~ben	at least they enforce the large unsubscribe button
2018-12-13 15:59:05	erxeto	jan6: half the shit you may get in your inbox is sent by mailchimp
2018-12-13 15:59:29	~ben	yeah they've taken over most newsletter mailings
2018-12-13 15:59:50	+jan6	I don't get shit in my inbox, lol

2018-12-13 16:05:06	~ben	lol yes that's a different definition of shit
2018-12-13 16:05:19	+jan6	facebook is for sure, but it's the only way to talk with classmates and it's not THE worst thing
2018-12-13 16:05:31	+jan6	top 10 ofc
2018-12-13 16:06:10	~ben	what's worse than facebook??
2018-12-13 16:06:12	~ben	!?
2018-12-13 16:06:36	+jan6	hm, whatsapp, snapchat, instagram, etc

2018-12-13 16:07:27	~ben	i don't understand how they're any better than fb
2018-12-13 16:07:49	+jan6	that's what I'm saying, they're not better, they're worse
2018-12-13 16:08:09	epicmorphism	i mean snapchat and instagram are just .. fucking terrible
2018-12-13 16:08:13	+jan6	^
2018-12-13 16:08:24	kirch	insta's better than FB because it's less intrusive
2018-12-13 16:08:25	epicmorphism	tell your classmates to use irc jan6 
2018-12-13 16:08:31	+jan6	lol, no

2018-12-13 16:47:20	TildeBot	ubergeek: <~Freeappsw> i guess i need to reschedule my tx on tilde radio.tildeverse.org/doc is your opinion of federated services?
2018-12-13 16:47:30	+jan6	(irc doesn't work cause lack of integrated media)
2018-12-13 16:47:53	%ubergeek	You don't need integrated media in a textual chat, do you?
2018-12-13 16:48:17	+jan6	well, the point beig you can't just click a button to have a photo of your dog in the chat
2018-12-13 16:48:28	%ubergeek	But, Signal is a very good replacement for fb messenger
2018-12-13 16:48:29	+jan6	it's not just textual, is what I'm saying
2018-12-13 16:48:35	+jan6	hm, kay thn

2018-12-13 16:49:26	%ubergeek	enjoy the event :)
2018-12-13 16:49:45	%ubergeek	signal is end-to-end encyrpted, and nobody by you and the recepient can read it.
2018-12-13 16:49:45	~ben	not much though; it's centralized as well
2018-12-13 16:50:00	%ubergeek	fb messenger:  Anyone working at fb can read it
2018-12-13 16:50:11	%ubergeek	THere was some thought put into the "why" of that, though
2018-12-13 16:50:15	%ubergeek	(The centralization)
2018-12-13 16:50:26	+jan6	signal is opensource tho, afaik
2018-12-13 16:50:35	~ben	you can't run your own client on signal

2018-12-13 17:35:31	~ben	matrix has the most potential
2018-12-13 17:35:40	~ben	xmpp holds its own

2018-12-13 22:27:28	mushmouth	skiing
2018-12-13 22:27:36	~ben	i used to race when i was younger
2018-12-13 22:27:42	~ben	before i could feel how cold it was
2018-12-13 22:27:44	mushmouth	ben: i did cross country running as a kid
2018-12-13 22:28:17	~ben	at school?
2018-12-13 22:28:24	mushmouth	i did it for a gradeschool
2018-12-13 22:28:27	mushmouth	i was on the team
2018-12-13 22:28:39	~ben	my dad used to pull me in a little sled when they went cross country skiing
2018-12-13 22:31:09	+jan6	oof
2018-12-13 22:31:23	+jan6	that's gonna take a few days, lol
2018-12-13 22:32:32	~ben	few days to do what?
2018-12-13 22:34:29	+jan6	to ski literally cross country
2018-12-13 22:34:54	+jan6	unless the country is luxemburg, which you can't ski in i bet
2018-12-13 22:35:02	~ben	lol what
2018-12-13 22:35:11	~ben	cross country skiing 
2018-12-13 22:35:15	~ben	as opposed to downhill
2018-12-13 22:35:31	+jan6	you mean uphill skiing? ;P
2018-12-13 22:35:33	~ben	no
2018-12-13 22:35:34	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-13 22:35:45	~ben	i guess you can also call it nordic
2018-12-13 22:35:51	~ben	then downhill is alpine
2018-12-13 22:36:50	+jan6	it'd be best to not call stuff by really dam unrelated names, even if they'r technically not wrong (it's not related to crossing countries in any way, despite sounding like a trip through entire country)
2018-12-13 22:37:07	+jan6	downhill linux? ;P
2018-12-13 22:40:08	~ben	they have both names
2018-12-13 22:40:11	~ben	it's not unrelated at all
2018-12-13 22:40:32	+jan6	17:40:11           ~ben | it's not unrelated at all
2018-12-13 22:40:35	+jan6	how is it then?
2018-12-13 22:40:47	~ben	that's what they're called
2018-12-13 22:40:55	~ben	you can use either name
2018-12-13 22:41:05	+jan6	you said it's "not UNRELATED at all"
2018-12-13 22:41:11	+jan6	so why's it not unrelated?
2018-12-13 22:42:45	+jan6	as I said, it's technically not wrong to call it that, but you say it's "opposed to downhill skiing", me: "so it's totally unrelated to crossing countries in any way" you: "it's not unrelated at all"
2018-12-13 22:43:11	+jan6	explanation as to how it IS related?
2018-12-13 22:43:56	+jan6	*cricets*
2018-12-13 22:44:01	+jan6	ben?
2018-12-13 22:44:17	~ben	what
2018-12-13 22:44:20	~ben	i'm so confused
2018-12-13 22:44:31	~ben	cross country == alpine
2018-12-13 22:44:34	~ben	sdfpoijwqefpoiqj
2018-12-13 22:44:39	~ben	cross country == nordic
2018-12-13 22:44:42	~ben	downhill == alpine
2018-12-13 22:44:58	~ben	so cross country as opposed to downhill
2018-12-13 22:45:24	+jan6	I agreed to that part, sounds fine
2018-12-13 22:47:10	+jan6	you said it's *not UNRELATED* to crossing countries after I said that it's technically not wrong, but as it's not crossing countries it shouldn't be called such
2018-12-13 22:47:27	+jan6	saying it is somehow related to that
2018-12-13 22:47:31	+jan6	which I don't get
2018-12-13 22:48:07	~ben	i was responding to: 17:36 <+jan6> it'd be best to not call stuff by really dam unrelated names
2018-12-13 22:48:20	~ben	i meant that that's the name so it's related
2018-12-13 22:48:37	+jan6	"even if they'r technically not" was the next part, aknowledging that
2018-12-13 22:48:49	+jan6	"even if they'r technically not wrong" was the next part, aknowledging that
2018-12-13 22:49:00	~ben	ikd
2018-12-13 22:49:26	+jan6	it really appeared to go after the latter part of the same line, "it's not related to crossing countries in any way"
2018-12-13 22:49:38	~ben	oh i wasn't responding to that
2018-12-13 22:49:43	+jan6	eh, I guess that's cleared up now
2018-12-13 22:49:49	~ben	i guess you're crossing country
2018-12-13 22:50:04	~ben	country in the general sense of land
2018-12-13 22:50:17	+jan6	it's not even crossing county, but whole country
2018-12-13 22:50:56	~ben	country in the innumerable sense

2018-12-13 23:20:14	jack3	robdrake:  ping is ping.  :)
2018-12-13 23:20:16	~ben	if it did that like once a day it would be more acceptable
2018-12-13 23:20:23	~ben	this is a ping: jack3 
2018-12-13 23:20:25	robdrake	pinging someone is also saying there name :P
2018-12-13 23:20:28	~ben	yup
2018-12-13 23:20:31	~ben	that's what i meant

2018-12-13 23:20:45	robdrake	no, old jargon you old fart
2018-12-13 23:20:56	jack3	anyway.. I have scripts, and I jsut exclude the bots name... it can say my nick all it wants, and it is ignored.

2018-12-13 23:21:20	jack3	I don't remember that as ping, from 25+ years ago.  Sorry
2018-12-13 23:21:21	~ben	hmm
2018-12-13 23:22:20	~ben	i could probably figure out a way to rig that up

2018-12-13 23:22:25	jack3	heheeh
2018-12-13 23:22:28	~ben	still too many pings
2018-12-13 23:22:36	jack3	instead,  find more people to go there and play
2018-12-13 23:22:37	jack3	:)
2018-12-13 23:22:41	~ben	i just use the default highlight notification settings
2018-12-13 23:22:53	~ben	can you set it to ping less often?
2018-12-13 23:23:17	jack3	I'm heading out now..   but I'll try to remember to look through the zillion config options of that script, either later when I get back, or tomorrow
2018-12-13 23:23:24	~ben	lol ok
2018-12-13 23:23:25	jack3	don't hesitate to remind me again, tomorrow though

2018-12-13 23:26:30	jack3	heh
2018-12-13 23:26:50	~ben	lol
2018-12-13 23:27:07	~ben	i'll see if anyone in #weechat on freenode have any ideas
2018-12-13 23:27:15	jack3	ben :  nick = surfist       geeky type.   we've known him a while now.
2018-12-13 23:27:25	~ben	i know i could hide all messages from that bot
2018-12-13 23:27:34	~ben	i figured
2018-12-13 23:27:46	~ben	robdrake mentioned having a couple other people that might stop by :)
2018-12-13 23:28:03	jack3	it is nice to be promoted to being a "people"
2018-12-13 23:28:06	jack3	>g<
2018-12-13 23:28:58	robdrake	not an option weechat.look.buffer_notify.default message
2018-12-13 23:29:18	~ben	i don't want that cause then i don't get any pings
2018-12-13 23:30:32	jack3	I can't imagine that a powerful chat client won't let you script something to just ignore one particular user
2018-12-13 23:30:52	jack3	we'll have to ask surfist.  he likes a good challenge
2018-12-13 23:30:53	jack3	heeh
2018-12-13 23:30:54	~ben	yeah, just gotta find the option
2018-12-13 23:30:57	~ben	might be in /filter
2018-12-13 23:30:59	~ben	or /buffer
2018-12-13 23:31:10	jack3	ok
2018-12-13 23:31:12	jack3	luck on you

2018-12-14 05:21:38	ahriman	robdrake, tilde.team execs byobu on login, so if you hit alt and an arrow key you can move between irc, mail, and shell. the irc label will highlight itself if you get a mention or something and you can pop over by holding alt again and hitting an arrow key
2018-12-14 05:22:25	ahriman	the older unix talk/com services have fallen out of use - the only place i've personally seen them get any use is sdf and that is sparse

2018-12-14 07:23:03	robdrake	I know I'm rambling, sorry, but...
2018-12-14 07:23:34	robdrake	Now with care and such going so far downhill, Rayma and I are seriously planning on moving
2018-12-14 07:24:26	robdrake	Especially with my family causing my change in fiances to cost me my own VPS
2018-12-14 07:24:39	robdrake	but then I wouldn't have met you all
2018-12-14 07:25:11	 *	robdrake listens to the crickets
2018-12-14 07:28:35	ahriman	it's a bit slow here tonight
2018-12-14 07:29:10	ahriman	moving to another nursing home?
2018-12-14 07:30:45	robdrake	no apartment
2018-12-14 07:30:45	TildeBot	no u infinity robdrake
2018-12-14 07:31:27	robdrake	hopefully, with home health care, me for a suprapubic catheter and wound care, Rayma for her ostomy
2018-12-14 07:32:27	robdrake	suprapubic catheter: hole below the naval, going in and down at a 45 degree angle, to the bladder, rather pernament
2018-12-14 07:33:46	robdrake	better than an indwelling, which is what is meant usually when people say 'catheter'
2018-12-14 07:36:13	robdrake	As I've said, no pity for me, I've made my bed, I have to lye in it
2018-12-14 07:36:34	ahriman	sounds rather painful / irritating
2018-12-14 07:37:05	robdrake	the suprapubic is neither if all is good, unlike the indwelling
2018-12-14 07:37:12	ahriman	ah okay
2018-12-14 07:37:27	ahriman	ive been threatened with a catheter at the hospital before
2018-12-14 07:37:39	robdrake	why threatened?
2018-12-14 07:37:42	ahriman	as in "piss in this cup now or we'll cath you"
2018-12-14 07:37:59	robdrake	drug test?
2018-12-14 07:38:03	ahriman	at that time, yes
2018-12-14 07:38:13	robdrake	oh fun
2018-12-14 07:38:16	ahriman	im clean now
2018-12-14 07:38:34	robdrake	me, I had to originally ask to be catheterized, couldn't pee
2018-12-14 07:39:31	robdrake	last time I had a urine sample taken, I was clean, and it was to check for bacteria, that night the UA would have been dirty for weed
2018-12-14 07:40:10	robdrake	of course, with me clean is relative, with all my prescriptions
2018-12-14 07:40:36	ahriman	oh man, i haven't smoked any weed in a few years
2018-12-14 07:40:47	ahriman	it makes me paranoid but i still miss it
2018-12-14 07:41:13	robdrake	I don't do enough for the paranoia to get out of control
2018-12-14 07:41:30	ahriman	ah that makes sense
2018-12-14 07:41:40	ahriman	i always go overboard with drugs so i had to stop all of them
2018-12-14 07:41:57	robdrake	helps that this stuff is $20 / gram
2018-12-14 07:42:09	robdrake	and worth it
2018-12-14 07:42:24	ahriman	you in a legal state?
2018-12-14 07:42:40	ahriman	im not, unfortunately -- virginia
2018-12-14 07:42:50	robdrake	medical only, but my doctor worries about his DEA license, so he won't prescribe it
2018-12-14 07:42:58	ahriman	ah okay
2018-12-14 07:43:32	ahriman	robdrake: you use linux on your personal pc?
2018-12-14 07:43:48	robdrake	yeah
2018-12-14 07:44:01	ahriman	cool cool, which distro?
2018-12-14 07:44:07	robdrake	linux mint
2018-12-14 07:44:21	ahriman	i like the DE for linux mint
2018-12-14 07:44:22	robdrake	no hassle w/ codecs
2018-12-14 07:44:22	TildeBot	no u infinity robdrake
2018-12-14 07:44:39	robdrake	DE?
2018-12-14 07:44:58	ahriman	my dad wanted a laptop with linux on it so he didn't have to worry about viruses/etc/bullshit, so i gave him my thinkpad t420 and put mint on it
2018-12-14 07:45:02	ahriman	desktop environment
2018-12-14 07:45:10	robdrake	oh ok
2018-12-14 07:45:28	robdrake	though anymore, this is a frankenlinux
2018-12-14 07:45:39	ahriman	he warmed up to it real quick, since the default DE for mint (cinnamon i think?) is so windows-like
2018-12-14 07:45:57	robdrake	yeah cinnamon
2018-12-14 07:45:58	ahriman	hey linux is all about being a frankenstein of an OS lol
2018-12-14 07:46:43	robdrake	the nicotene demon is screaming, brb
2018-12-14 07:46:54	ahriman	yeah good idea, im gonna get me a cigret as well

2018-12-14 16:16:18	~tomasino	vue is great, but it leaves you hanging on the basic setup. They're like "do whatever you want!" and people have taken that down weird paths
2018-12-14 16:16:38	~tomasino	nuxt simplifies it for you, sets up some automatic stuff with routing to save time, and adds the super sexy "server-middleware" 
2018-12-14 16:16:53	~tomasino	you can write your express handlers directly inside your nuxt project
2018-12-14 16:17:02	~tomasino	you don't need a separate backend repo to connect to
2018-12-14 16:17:21	~tomasino	it's all node, after-all
2018-12-14 16:18:35	robdrake	k
2018-12-14 16:20:35	robdrake	thank you for your time tomasino 
2018-12-14 16:20:41	~ben	oh no the nuxt chat is on discord :(
2018-12-14 16:20:56	robdrake	..|.. discord
2018-12-14 16:21:03	~ben	lol eys
2018-12-14 16:21:21	~ben	imo open source projects should use open chat platforms
2018-12-14 16:21:41	robdrake	at least gitter.im is open source
2018-12-14 16:21:55	~ben	is it though?
2018-12-14 16:22:03	robdrake	well, claims to be
2018-12-14 16:22:06	robdrake	idk
2018-12-14 16:22:10	~tomasino	lots of nodey crap on discord
2018-12-14 16:22:18	 *	tomasino goes back to writing makefiles and bourne shell
2018-12-14 16:22:34	robdrake	I haven't investigated gitter, only use it for Solid
2018-12-14 16:22:50	~ben	gitter isn't open source, nor does it claim to be afaict
2018-12-14 16:23:03	~ben	at least they have an irc gateway
2018-12-14 16:23:10	robdrake	I swear I had read that it was somewhere

2018-12-14 16:24:12	~ben	mastodon uses discord for their dev chat
2018-12-14 16:24:21	~ben	and they only give you the link if you make a donation or something
2018-12-14 16:24:30	mushmouth	that's gross
2018-12-14 16:24:37	mushmouth	pidgin discord is open for everyone
2018-12-14 16:25:11	~ben	if it's open source it shouldn't be on discord

2018-12-14 16:29:45	~ben	of course you can
2018-12-14 16:30:01	robdrake	let me test more, connecting to irc.gitter.im failed
2018-12-14 16:30:17	~ben	/server add gitter irc.gitter.im -ssl -autoconnect
2018-12-14 16:30:40	~ben	make sure you set the server password to the auth key you get from the page
2018-12-14 16:30:48	~ben	and that it's using your correct username
2018-12-14 16:31:01	~ben	/fset irc.server.gitter
2018-12-14 16:31:15	robdrake	ok

2018-12-14 20:34:27	+aewens	I'll try out stunnel. The closest I got so far was from ncat --ssl where it reads of the HTTP response headers, but the content is either compressed or encrypted
2018-12-14 20:37:36	~ben	huh idk 
2018-12-14 20:40:15	+aewens	Yeah, just got openssl to work too (apparently piping in the data doesn't work because there's a lag where it's doing SSL stuff before taking input). It barfed out the same output, but I'm guessing now it's compressed?
2018-12-14 20:40:57	~ben	hmmst

2018-12-14 20:53:54	ahriman	noiceeee fosslinux 
2018-12-14 20:53:58	ahriman	i mean bosslinux
2018-12-14 20:54:38	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-14 20:54:46	fosslinux	hmmm weird
2018-12-14 20:54:53	fosslinux	ssh is REALLY slow to establisha  connection
2018-12-14 20:55:01	ahriman	why did you have to use a windows vm tho
2018-12-14 20:55:18	ahriman	is it wpa enterprise, because wpa_supplicant can do enterprise
2018-12-14 20:55:47	ahriman	i even had wpa enterprise working on openbsd when i was in college
2018-12-14 20:56:53	fosslinux	idk
2018-12-14 20:57:05	fosslinux	its the *weirdest* network
2018-12-14 20:57:14	fosslinux	and the proxy is messed up
2018-12-14 20:57:30	ahriman	oh
2018-12-14 20:58:35	@cmccabe	tomasino: way late reply -- i think that is another cmccabe, or at least i don't remember making that unix.com post. although i did work through a sed/awk book once...

2018-12-14 21:08:01	+aewens	Success! Apparently blindly copy/pasting headers is a poor choice here.
2018-12-14 21:08:15	+aewens	"Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br" was the culprit. Remove it and it works as expected
2018-12-14 21:09:04	+aewens	You can get it working using `openssl s_client -connect tildegit.org:443 | tee output` and dump in your HTTP request and the output will be in the "output" file.
2018-12-14 21:30:43	+jan6	fosslinux: @ got working, so, did you then install VPN server on the VM and are now proxying everything through it? ;P

2018-12-14 22:49:26	+jan6	you can make ssh socks, and specific ports, but manual ports r annoying, and socks requires, well, socks...
2018-12-14 22:51:35	fosslinux	?
2018-12-14 22:51:42	fosslinux	it works fine

2018-12-15 00:47:18	~ben	looks sketchy
2018-12-15 00:48:45	edwardthefma	Iv looked them up 
2018-12-15 00:49:34	edwardthefma	The addresses and numbers match up
2018-12-15 00:49:52	edwardthefma	To realworld 
2018-12-15 00:52:35	~ben	still looks sketchy
2018-12-15 00:53:09	edwardthefma	Most ethical hacking stuff looks sketchy 
2018-12-15 00:55:30	%ubergeek	So...  Sounds like nessus
2018-12-15 00:57:28	mushmouth	can iphones/android both use voip?
2018-12-15 00:57:46	fosslinux	hmm does look sketchy
2018-12-15 00:57:49	~ben	should be able to
2018-12-15 00:57:52	fosslinux	yes mushmouth afaik
2018-12-15 00:58:22	edwardthefma	Yes you can do VoIP on any internet connected phone
2018-12-15 00:58:34	mushmouth	waiting for my chicken wings from mom
2018-12-15 00:58:53	fosslinux	edwardthefma: more often than not there's no one-hit-for-all tool to test for vulnerabilites in a network; like this claims. sketchy
2018-12-15 01:00:00	mushmouth	yeah usually you have to chain a bunch of programs
2018-12-15 01:00:59	edwardthefma	That's true but if I get a free cloud mangment system without the legwork of setting it up I'm happy
2018-12-15 01:03:43	mushmouth	nothing ever comes easy in unix
2018-12-15 01:04:35	edwardthefma	That's why you don't look a gift horse in the mouth
2018-12-15 01:23:56	%ubergeek	You mean like cloud formation?
2018-12-15 01:24:20	%ubergeek	And I have to disagree mushmouth:  everything comes easy in *Nix :)
2018-12-15 01:24:44	%ubergeek	and, as long as you can download a VoIP client, you can do voip on any device.
2018-12-15 01:25:04	%ubergeek	Android (Pure android) has a built in SIP client, in fact.
2018-12-15 01:25:12	mushmouth	use gentoo then ubergeek or lfs :P
2018-12-15 01:25:56	fosslinux	mushmouth: gentoo isnt too hard
2018-12-15 01:26:08	fosslinux	i want to make a linux distro based on gentoo
2018-12-15 01:26:17	fosslinux	that you can verify from beginning to end

2018-12-15 01:36:57	~ben	i like msys2 
2018-12-15 01:37:14	%ubergeek	Yeah, I even tried that, and couldn't tolerate it.  Felt like a wrapper around cmd

2018-12-15 01:38:42	~ben	yeah it does
2018-12-15 01:38:46	%ubergeek	hrm...
2018-12-15 01:38:48	fosslinux	he nice
2018-12-15 01:38:49	~ben	pacman -S mosh
2018-12-15 01:38:59	~ben	limited package repo but it's p nice
2018-12-15 01:38:59	fosslinux	windows subsystem linux ftw
2018-12-15 01:39:04	~ben	ehhh
2018-12-15 01:39:06	fosslinux	sudo apt-get install mosh
2018-12-15 01:39:12	fosslinux	i have my debian 
2018-12-15 01:39:13	%ubergeek	If (And a big if) I ever am forced to use windows, I'll give it a spin.
2018-12-15 01:39:16	mastergeek	on windows I'm less than a newb with the cmd and powershell...
2018-12-15 01:39:27	fosslinux	im newb with cmd
2018-12-15 01:39:28	fosslinux	not great
2018-12-15 01:39:33	fosslinux	i can write basic bat scripts
2018-12-15 01:39:39	fosslinux	with powershell i no NOTHING
2018-12-15 01:39:41	%ubergeek	But, it comes down to:  If I'm forced to use Windows, I'll probably look for a new job
2018-12-15 01:39:54	fosslinux	oh wow
2018-12-15 01:39:57	%ubergeek	A linux guy having to use Windows is ridiculous, on it's face.
2018-12-15 01:40:02	fosslinux	true
2018-12-15 01:40:12	fosslinux	well i want to work as infosec
2018-12-15 01:40:17	mastergeek	I find it easier to just stuff a lua interpreter in C:\Windows\System32 and use Lua instead of bat scripts
2018-12-15 01:40:23	fosslinux	which means i basically need linux lol
2018-12-15 01:40:33	%ubergeek	Just stick emacs in place of cmd.exe...
2018-12-15 01:40:39	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-15 01:40:45	fosslinux	windows is inheriently insecure
2018-12-15 01:40:48	~ben	so is mac
2018-12-15 01:40:50	fosslinux	+ reasons why i hate it
2018-12-15 01:40:54	mastergeek	so is life
2018-12-15 01:40:55	%ubergeek	well, not anymore (Windows)
2018-12-15 01:41:12	%ubergeek	It's "reasonably" secure
2018-12-15 01:41:22	fosslinux	boot from win cd; swap cmd and magnifier; activate magnifier on login screen; create self account+adminstrator/
2018-12-15 01:41:33	mastergeek	which means it is "reasonably" insecure as well, right?
2018-12-15 01:41:34	fosslinux	boom goodbye windows
2018-12-15 01:41:48	fosslinux	ubergeek: did you just say winodws was reasonably secure?
2018-12-15 01:41:53	%ubergeek	Yes.
2018-12-15 01:42:02	fosslinux	01:41:22      fosslinux | boot from win cd; swap cmd and magnifier; activate magnifier on login screen; create self account+adminstrator
2018-12-15 01:42:03	%ubergeek	Now.
2018-12-15 01:42:20	%ubergeek	fosslinux: you can own a Linux machine if you boot from external media, though
2018-12-15 01:42:25	mushmouth	im not trying to claim that linux or nix isn't hard. it's just not for your every joe unless you have a ton of gui knowledge
2018-12-15 01:42:35	fosslinux	no it isnt mushmouth 
2018-12-15 01:42:36	TildeBot	no u infinity fosslinux
2018-12-15 01:42:36	mushmouth	or is hard
2018-12-15 01:42:41	mushmouth	sorry i phrased that wrong
2018-12-15 01:42:42	%ubergeek	My wife and kids use Linux just fine.
2018-12-15 01:42:43	mastergeek	I think linux has display managers which can be tricked into running a binary before login
2018-12-15 01:42:50	%ubergeek	^^^
2018-12-15 01:42:51	fosslinux	its isnt for your everyday joe for system management
2018-12-15 01:43:04	fosslinux	im sure they do mastergeek 
2018-12-15 01:43:07	mushmouth	ubergeek: i tried getting my family members to use it. i have no luck
2018-12-15 01:43:11	%ubergeek	Example 1 of Windows being *more* secure than Linux...
2018-12-15 01:43:13	fosslinux	thats why you dont use that one
2018-12-15 01:43:18	mushmouth	they think what i use is ancient
2018-12-15 01:43:24	mushmouth	like a dos prompt
2018-12-15 01:43:28	%ubergeek	Anything can grab the lock screen key combo, in Linux
2018-12-15 01:43:36	fosslinux	on linux you can have *choice*
2018-12-15 01:43:42	%ubergeek	In Windows, ONLY Windows kernel can
2018-12-15 01:43:43	fosslinux	which dm you use; login manager; etc
2018-12-15 01:43:50	fosslinux	in windows, you dont have choice
2018-12-15 01:43:56	mastergeek	I use xinitrc so...
2018-12-15 01:43:59	%ubergeek	So, in Linux, you can install a sniffer snub in the lock screen.
2018-12-15 01:44:07	mushmouth	my family memembers swear by macs
2018-12-15 01:44:09	fosslinux	if theres a security hole, you have to wait for windows to fix security bugs
2018-12-15 01:44:12	%ubergeek	s/snub/stub
2018-12-15 01:44:12	sedbot	<ubergeek> So, in Linux, you can install a sniffer stub in the lock screen.
2018-12-15 01:44:29	mushmouth	i use any nix or dos os or antyhing retro
2018-12-15 01:44:30	fosslinux	ubergeek: so you dont use a login manager that allows you to do taht
2018-12-15 01:44:42	%ubergeek	I have the house running on Elementary or Manjaro.
2018-12-15 01:44:43	fosslinux	which isn't something oyu can do in windows
2018-12-15 01:44:54	%ubergeek	Kids use manjaro because of gaming
2018-12-15 01:45:02	%ubergeek	wife uses elementary
2018-12-15 01:45:21	%ubergeek	I get no more support requests.  I just have ansible reach out, and do updates nightly.
2018-12-15 01:45:35	mushmouth	typically it doesn't matter what os i use because im mainly like chrome then terminal
2018-12-15 01:45:35	mastergeek	and you use Elemanjaro or what?
2018-12-15 01:45:47	%ubergeek	I use manjaro kde
2018-12-15 01:45:59	fosslinux	i wouldn't use a gui if it wasnt for graphical web browsers tbh
2018-12-15 01:46:02	%ubergeek	Or MacOS.  Whichever one is closer
2018-12-15 01:46:09	%ubergeek	fosslinux: w3m-img ftw
2018-12-15 01:46:21	mastergeek	is manjaro still tightly tied up to the mhwdb package?
2018-12-15 01:46:23	mushmouth	same honestly fosslinux 
2018-12-15 01:46:34	%ubergeek	mastergeek: yes
2018-12-15 01:46:43	fosslinux	ubergeek: text web browsers dont render most stuff correctly
2018-12-15 01:46:46	mastergeek	I don't get why they do that...
2018-12-15 01:46:50	fosslinux	not even google
2018-12-15 01:47:13	%ubergeek	google renders fine for me in w3m
2018-12-15 01:47:19	fosslinux	hmm
2018-12-15 01:47:28	%ubergeek	but, I'm more a textual site kinda guy anyways
2018-12-15 01:47:39	fosslinux	hehe same
2018-12-15 01:47:39	%ubergeek	ie, imgur isn't a thing I visit often
2018-12-15 01:47:44	fosslinux	sometimes you cant help it though
2018-12-15 01:47:50	mushmouth	i watch a lot of videos
2018-12-15 01:47:52	%ubergeek	true
2018-12-15 01:48:05	fosslinux	oh google is noice in w3m
2018-12-15 01:48:05	mushmouth	mostly on my phone though
2018-12-15 01:48:07	%ubergeek	yeah, videos you *kinda* can do in a terminal, but only a tty
2018-12-15 01:48:12	fosslinux	i was thinking of lynx
2018-12-15 01:48:19	%ubergeek	(So the app can grab the fb device)
2018-12-15 01:48:38	fosslinux	howtogeek.com dosent render well :(
2018-12-15 01:48:42	%ubergeek	But, I guess you *could* use libcaca to render your videos lol
2018-12-15 01:48:45	mushmouth	ubergeek: or ascii
2018-12-15 01:49:17	%ubergeek	libcaca is an ascii library for videos and images :)

2018-12-15 01:50:19	%ubergeek	I'm wagering money that MS buys Canonical in the next 5 years
2018-12-15 01:50:22	mastergeek	it's happening
2018-12-15 01:50:33	mushmouth	ubergeek: i wager 1 month
2018-12-15 01:50:36	fosslinux	how dumv would that be ubergeek 
2018-12-15 01:50:48	fosslinux	i swear we cant let ms take over the linux world
2018-12-15 01:51:03	fosslinux	first canonical->ubuntu->upstream patches to debian-> the rest of linux
2018-12-15 01:51:32	fosslinux	did you guys here about edge -> chromium?
2018-12-15 01:51:33	%ubergeek	IBM already started...  It's the only sensible move for MS
2018-12-15 01:51:41	fosslinux	true ubergeek 
2018-12-15 01:51:56	fosslinux	did you know that linux is the most popular os in the world thanks ot android
2018-12-15 01:52:07	%ubergeek	And we already have svchost, I mean systemd, in Linux...
2018-12-15 01:52:34	fosslinux	systemd.......
2018-12-15 01:52:36	%ubergeek	And the registry, cough, gconfdb, as well..
2018-12-15 01:53:10	fosslinux	linux is gettting flawed i reckon
2018-12-15 01:53:16	mastergeek	I want to try an OpenRC arch
2018-12-15 01:53:19	fosslinux	taking too many ideas from stuff like windows
2018-12-15 01:53:20	mastergeek	systemd is so bloated
2018-12-15 01:53:26	fosslinux	^
2018-12-15 01:53:27	%ubergeek	Windows and MacOS
2018-12-15 01:53:39	%ubergeek	internals from Windows, and GUI design from MacOS
2018-12-15 01:53:59	fosslinux	i think bsd is closer these days to *true* unix philosiphy
2018-12-15 01:54:04	fosslinux	ahriman: 
2018-12-15 01:54:24	%ubergeek	When MS does a Linux distro, I really, really, really hope they call it XENIX.
2018-12-15 01:54:46	fosslinux	lol i'm 80% sure that the first ms of ever was called that
2018-12-15 01:54:56	fosslinux	s/of/os
2018-12-15 01:54:57	sedbot	<fosslinux> lol i'm 80% sure that the first ms os ever was called that
2018-12-15 01:55:03	fosslinux	based on unix
2018-12-15 01:55:04	%ubergeek	fosslinux: it is...  And, one reason I'm not too torn using MacOS, as it'll help me get used to "The Free BSD Way"
2018-12-15 01:55:14	%ubergeek	Yep, Xenix was the MS UNIX :)
2018-12-15 01:55:44	fosslinux	maybe i should try out openbsd
2018-12-15 01:56:26	mushmouth	one thing i don't get on mac
2018-12-15 01:56:31	mushmouth	if you have a keyboard with a numpad
2018-12-15 01:56:35	fosslinux	hm?
2018-12-15 01:56:38	mushmouth	they completely disabled the feature
2018-12-15 01:56:41	~ben	systemd is actually reasonably modular
2018-12-15 01:56:56	mushmouth	there is no numpad beside the numbers for it
2018-12-15 01:57:26	mushmouth	ike you can't use the arrow keys on it
2018-12-15 01:57:27	mushmouth	etc
2018-12-15 01:58:26	%ubergeek	oh yeah, I've noticed that
2018-12-15 01:58:52	%ubergeek	I wouldn't mind systemd if I could disable journald
2018-12-15 01:59:00	%ubergeek	It's a waste of resources
2018-12-15 01:59:08	mushmouth	ubergeek: despite me having an actual keyboard for it
2018-12-15 01:59:13	mushmouth	it just not a function in mac
2018-12-15 01:59:26	%ubergeek	and if udev wasn't also non-disable-able
2018-12-15 01:59:34	%ubergeek	or was able to be disabled
2018-12-15 01:59:45	fosslinux	ok this is where we write a entire new operating system lol with all our stuff we want lmao

2018-12-15 02:06:59	%ubergeek	Oh, on tilde scale, I'd just want to log to /var/log :)
2018-12-15 02:07:20	%ubergeek	I think ELK would be overkill lol
2018-12-15 02:07:34	fosslinux	i saw someone who wrote their own init

2018-12-15 02:26:57	login	a cryptocurrency that allows running programs on a blockchain instead of just what bitcoin allows
2018-12-15 02:27:11	~ben	blockchain is not the answer
2018-12-15 02:27:23	login	I guess not...
2018-12-15 02:27:41	login	But each node runs *all* the programs on all of Ethereum
2018-12-15 02:28:04	login	stuff like that...
2018-12-15 02:28:17	login	Even Bitcoin has its own script, but it's not Turing-complete, called Bitcoin Script

2018-12-15 02:28:44	login	I think the Ethereum guy thought decentralised programs can never be shut down if there are enough nodes running them
2018-12-15 02:29:16	~ben	huh
2018-12-15 02:29:16	login	They wanted to make decentralised autonomous organisations, where voting and stuff like that is enforced by code
2018-12-15 02:29:46	login	And the immutability properties of the blockchain would improve trust in the code
2018-12-15 02:29:56	%ubergeek	I think it's also a way to profit off unused computing cycles, or something?
2018-12-15 02:30:39	login	Yeah, that's what it's really used for
2018-12-15 02:30:55	login	To profit from unused computing cycles because other people want to do the same so they hold ethereum
2018-12-15 02:31:10	login	It's like buying merchandise from your favourite band etc.

2018-12-15 03:13:15	mushmouth	catholic and public in canada are both open and non private for most part

2018-12-15 03:15:21	fosslinux	weird af
2018-12-15 03:16:27	mushmouth	public schools are typically really under funded compared to catholic
2018-12-15 03:16:38	mushmouth	like old school books
2018-12-15 03:16:41	mushmouth	not enough for the size
2018-12-15 03:17:51	mushmouth	public schools are also typically not well maintained
2018-12-15 03:19:54	~ben	huh that's interesting 
2018-12-15 03:20:03	~ben	the catholic school had worse funding in my hometown
2018-12-15 03:21:51	mushmouth	ben: the people i typically got along with were libarines, janitors
2018-12-15 03:22:01	mushmouth	i always knew them at any school i went too
2018-12-15 03:22:13	~ben	yeah you've mentioned that before
2018-12-15 03:22:46	mushmouth	most teachers were pricks
2018-12-15 03:22:57	mushmouth	and i assume they knew i was getting bullied by the kids and did nothing
2018-12-15 03:22:57	~ben	huh
2018-12-15 03:23:06	~ben	i had so many great teachers
2018-12-15 03:23:18	mushmouth	i can count how many great teachers i had on my hand
2018-12-15 03:23:45	mushmouth	very few in my position
2018-12-15 03:23:54	~ben	i highly doubt that any of them were actively malicious
2018-12-15 03:23:57	~ben	but you never know
2018-12-15 03:24:08	mushmouth	actually a few just never wanted to help me etc
2018-12-15 03:24:16	mushmouth	even if i was struggling
2018-12-15 03:24:28	mushmouth	some were very actively malicious
2018-12-15 03:24:44	~ben	that sucks
2018-12-15 03:25:26	mushmouth	some even wanted me to basically be removed from my family/mom at home
2018-12-15 03:25:37	mushmouth	even though i never done or mentioned anything bad
2018-12-15 03:27:03	~ben	huh
2018-12-15 03:27:20	mushmouth	i mentioned one time to a teacher. i had a "big brother"
2018-12-15 03:27:28	mushmouth	like as in the program that gives kids brothers
2018-12-15 03:27:43	mushmouth	and they thought i don't know something really bad
2018-12-15 03:27:55	mushmouth	this teacher and the education assitant were ganging up on me
2018-12-15 03:28:02	mushmouth	every chance they got
2018-12-15 03:28:11	mushmouth	was so fucking annoying i wanted to like strangle them
2018-12-15 03:28:37	mushmouth	they would ask me question that are very vague and are up to anyone to really figure out
2018-12-15 03:29:36	mushmouth	learned imageboard at the starting of highschool and became a different person

2018-12-15 07:17:05	mushmouth	hey ahriman 
2018-12-15 07:17:16	fosslinux	whats up ahriman 
2018-12-15 07:17:34	fosslinux	hey
2018-12-15 07:17:41	fosslinux	i'm going to write my own init in python
2018-12-15 07:18:02	 *	fosslinux frowns upon current popular inits that work well in debian
2018-12-15 07:18:39	mushmouth	gross
2018-12-15 07:18:49	mushmouth	python should only really be used for scripting
2018-12-15 07:19:09	fosslinux	init is scripting
2018-12-15 07:19:15	fosslinux	whats gross
2018-12-15 07:19:17	ahriman	hey mushmouth, hey fosslinux
2018-12-15 07:19:55	ahriman	idk how well that would work unless you had a statically-linked python interpreter in /bin/
2018-12-15 07:20:12	fosslinux	hmmmmm bash then
2018-12-15 07:20:15	fosslinux	bash works fine
2018-12-15 07:20:20	fosslinux	i've seen people do it before
2018-12-15 07:21:02	ahriman	most init systems use bourne, /bin/sh
2018-12-15 07:21:24	ahriman	except linux distributions which symlink /bin/sh to /bin/bash
2018-12-15 07:21:32	ahriman	except some linux distros*
2018-12-15 07:21:47	ahriman	and except systemd obv
2018-12-15 07:21:48	fosslinux	i really should work on tildelinux

2018-12-15 07:22:04	ahriman	dat b cool, no reason to reinvent the wheel with initsystems tho
2018-12-15 07:22:21	~ben	systemd is not as bad as everyone claims
2018-12-15 07:22:27	fosslinux	he
2018-12-15 07:22:30	ahriman	i mean you can use openrc like gentoo, or runit like voidlinux
2018-12-15 07:22:33	~ben	might be stockholm syndrome talking i guess
2018-12-15 07:22:35	~ben	devuan
2018-12-15 07:22:42	fosslinux	true
2018-12-15 07:22:49	fosslinux	ahriman: did you know about tildelinux?
2018-12-15 07:22:55	ahriman	no i did not
2018-12-15 07:22:55	TildeBot	no u infinity ahriman
2018-12-15 07:22:59	ahriman	stfu tildebot
2018-12-15 07:23:00	TildeBot	ahriman: $Home or ${home} is bash convention.
2018-12-15 07:23:05	fosslinux	lol wtf
2018-12-15 07:23:25	fosslinux	we're making a debian-based linux distribution centered around tildes
2018-12-15 07:23:44	fosslinux	with the ultimate goal of having everything on tilde{,s}.
2018-12-15 07:23:45	ahriman	oh neatoooo
2018-12-15 07:23:54	fosslinux	sose and i are working on it :)
2018-12-15 07:24:10	ahriman	it's going to get more and more difficult to stay away from systemd unfortunately
2018-12-15 07:24:19	fosslinux	hmm yeah
2018-12-15 07:24:29	fosslinux	i moved away from gnome primarily because of its dependence on it
2018-12-15 07:24:45	fosslinux	(i do run debian not devuan currently unfortunatly)
2018-12-15 07:24:51	fosslinux	i should reinstall
2018-12-15 07:24:52	ahriman	like i said though you can use openrc or runit
2018-12-15 07:25:05	ahriman	i just installed debian the other day on my main laptop
2018-12-15 07:25:11	fosslinux	noice
2018-12-15 07:25:17	ahriman	i missed linux
2018-12-15 07:25:23	fosslinux	runit is nice
2018-12-15 07:25:26	fosslinux	i used it for a while
2018-12-15 07:25:28	ahriman	yes it is
2018-12-15 07:26:37	fosslinux	the only reason i stopped using void linux was lacking, out of date software
2018-12-15 07:26:42	ahriman	my experience with it is limited though as i used it via voidlinux and that was brief
2018-12-15 07:26:47	~ben	https://wiki.debian.org/Debate/initsystem/systemd
2018-12-15 07:26:48	ahriman	yeah thats why i didnt stay with void

2018-12-15 07:28:02	fosslinux	stable is good for servers
2018-12-15 07:28:54	~ben	yup
2018-12-15 07:29:06	~ben	yeah i'm glad that projects like devaun exist
2018-12-15 07:29:11	fosslinux	"Myth: systemd is difficult."
2018-12-15 07:29:17	fosslinux	that is true
2018-12-15 07:29:24	fosslinux	systemd is not difficult whatsoever
2018-12-15 07:29:27	fosslinux	It Just Works.
2018-12-15 07:30:35	fosslinux	hmm 12 is interesting.... systemd being bloated i think has become a bit overexaggerated
2018-12-15 07:32:51	~ben	usually Just Works

2018-12-15 07:33:49	~ben	means you're missing the username

2018-12-15 07:35:01	~ben	heh ye
2018-12-15 07:36:15	ahriman	the only thing i don't like about systemd is the journal and im sure i'll get used to it. i'm just so accustomed to syslog
2018-12-15 07:37:44	~khuxkm|lounge	systemd sucks, especially when your unit files jusT STOP WORKING
2018-12-15 07:39:27	~ben	how often does that happen to you

2018-12-15 17:46:45	mushmouth	deepend: by the way i got that serial mouse yesterday
2018-12-15 17:46:55	~deepend	nice.. how you like it?
2018-12-15 17:47:22	mushmouth	pretty nice. a little awkard compared to a trackball of that era
2018-12-15 17:47:52	~deepend	nobody used trackballs :P lol jk
2018-12-15 17:50:42	mushmouth	even a thumber would make a little more sense
2018-12-15 17:51:53	~deepend	never liked those other type of mice.. I more prefer traditional type mice.. but thats me.. :D
2018-12-15 17:52:26	mushmouth	i like track balls a lot more
2018-12-15 17:52:33	mushmouth	good if you have limited space
2018-12-15 17:53:34	mushmouth	mouse is kind of ugly depending on which ones you geyt
2018-12-15 17:53:36	mushmouth	get*
2018-12-15 17:53:53	~deepend	yep
2018-12-15 17:54:51	~deepend	was sitting here reading and wondering what the difference was between my g900 mouse and the g903.. but i figured it out :P  the g903 is wireless charging capable
2018-12-15 17:55:07	mushmouth	which makes no sense why that difference
2018-12-15 17:55:26	mushmouth	at least with trackballs. you can typically find the difference pretty easily
2018-12-15 17:56:29	mushmouth	i liked zowie fk mouses
2018-12-15 17:56:33	mushmouth	specifically zowie fk1

2018-12-15 17:56:57	mushmouth	very minimal and no drivers needed to change the dpi or anything
2018-12-15 17:57:39	~deepend	nice nice.. yea the g900 has a hardware dpi button.. so no software needed for most things.  linux doesn't fully take advantage of the mouse but I am pretty basic... 
2018-12-15 17:57:58	mushmouth	zowie fk works pretty universal
2018-12-15 17:58:02	mushmouth	i tried it on linux before
2018-12-15 17:58:31	mushmouth	and bsd
2018-12-15 17:58:32	~deepend	theres just stuff you can do with the software that isnt' able to be done without.. like surface calibration.. and stuff like that.. for serious gamers (which I am not)
2018-12-15 17:58:33	 *	jan6 just likes the thinkpad track-point thingy, THE least movement needed to move the cursor ;P
2018-12-15 17:59:01	mushmouth	deepend: zowie fk i found to work on like say bsd/linux plan9 all the major nix with usb support
2018-12-15 17:59:10	~deepend	jan6: never got along with that type of mouse.. i can get by with it.. but Im not great at using it 
2018-12-15 18:00:32	mushmouth	deepend: also if your looking at a mic brand which works too
2018-12-15 18:00:38	mushmouth	blue snowball or yeti is good
2018-12-15 18:01:10	~deepend	yep.. might concider getting a decent mic at some point
2018-12-15 18:01:19	mushmouth	it works on bsd too
2018-12-15 18:01:21	mushmouth	i hear
2018-12-15 18:01:48	~deepend	would never use something on bsd.. so I"m good lol :)   and for audio streaming I use windows anyways
2018-12-15 18:02:01	mushmouth	deepend: when can we voice chat? :P
2018-12-15 18:03:34	~deepend	not a big fan of voice chat.  hate phones as well.. lol  on my cell 99% of my use is text based.. and on computers its the same. 
2018-12-15 18:03:45	mushmouth	why aren't you my dad deepend ? :P
2018-12-15 18:04:06	mushmouth	im same way

2018-12-15 18:09:11	mushmouth	id love for either bot to support all links for short urls
2018-12-15 18:09:23	mushmouth	some links just doesn't work. i try my best to use tinyurl extension
2018-12-15 18:09:34	+jan6	yeah, regular sed you can just keep adding  -e for each new pattern
2018-12-15 18:09:47	+jan6	mushmouth: give example of what doesn't work
2018-12-15 18:10:05	mushmouth	jan6: i don't remember of the top of my head but if i do i will
2018-12-15 18:10:16	+jan6	it doesn't work with redirecting urls, I think, but haven't seen much other problems
2018-12-15 18:10:20	mushmouth	i had it happen before
2018-12-15 18:10:33	mushmouth	you'll just have to take my word for it for now :shrug:
2018-12-15 18:11:53	+jan6	easy solution, make a bot that does something like curl -L and then parses looking for the og:title tag (which tildebot uses afaik) and falls back to <title> if it's missing
2018-12-15 18:11:55	TildeBot	jan6, What kind of screws it uses bootstrap 3.10 for npm. I just don't forget that jan6 is missing chromosomes.
2018-12-15 18:13:56	+jan6	tildebot, I just don't forget that master jan6 is superior to nobody
2018-12-15 18:13:57	TildeBot	jan6: , Jan6 is the village idiot called midlow who has a microscopic peepee, as master jan6 orders thy capture!
2018-12-15 18:15:10	mushmouth	bot is always right about midlow
2018-12-15 18:16:59	~deepend	tildebot only shortens down to a certain length
2018-12-15 18:16:59	TildeBot	deepend: Idk what else can you move to a certain length.

2018-12-15 18:29:24	+jan6	hm, mushmouth, just wondering, if you like trackballs, what kind of design do you like? the ball-in-the-middle style?
2018-12-15 18:30:02	mushmouth	jan6: i like them all to be honest
2018-12-15 18:33:23	mushmouth	like there none that i really hate
2018-12-15 18:36:19	edwardthefma	Lol track ball
2018-12-15 18:37:25	+jan6	k
2018-12-15 18:38:50	+jan6	searching for videos on it revealed that most people who tried using trackballs for a week or so liked them for casual use like browsing or writing stuff, etc, but not for games (since OF COURSE they test with FPS titles, lol)
2018-12-15 18:39:08	+jan6	as long as there was a scrollwheel of course
2018-12-15 18:39:42	+jan6	and as they mentioned, good thing is you can always have a mouse pluged in as well and switch between them
2018-12-15 18:41:38	mushmouth	jan6: i actually play them with games, fps, rts etc
2018-12-15 18:41:45	mushmouth	i use a unicomp too
2018-12-15 18:42:50	mushmouth	i don't use fancy gaming tier marketing stuff
2018-12-15 18:43:03	mushmouth	deepend: what would lowering the min size be?
2018-12-15 18:43:25	~deepend	so it'll shorten more urls

2018-12-15 20:05:04	+jan6	it's surprising, but you can put quite literally anything between the amazon.tld/ and /dp
2018-12-15 20:05:58	+jan6	so you could exploit this to share urls, messages, whatever
2018-12-15 20:06:56	+jan6	great if you for some reason use the default dns from an ISP known to be logging dns, or something
2018-12-15 20:25:09	robdrake	if your ISP logs dns, use TOR

2018-12-15 21:20:04	~ben	sid is usually fine but testing is usually quite solid

2018-12-15 21:20:24	fosslinux	testing takes time for bugs to be fixed
2018-12-15 21:20:40	~ben	you could always just add the unstable repos to testing
2018-12-15 21:20:47	~ben	and apt install -t unstable <package>
2018-12-15 21:20:54	~ben	best of both worlds
2018-12-15 21:21:15	+jan6	testing is what I'd call "stable" myself, the actual Stable branch would be labelled LTS instead or something
2018-12-15 21:21:21	+jan6	yeah
2018-12-15 21:21:45	+jan6	it's nice to pin a few packages to unstable if needed
2018-12-15 21:22:22	+jan6	I wonder if anyone even uses the "absolutely chaotic and often broken" branch ever, lol
2018-12-15 21:22:47	+jan6	forgot it's canon name, but there's one even newer than unstable

2018-12-16 03:06:13	fosslinux	well how do they allow you to do stiff
2018-12-16 03:06:25	~ben	validation
2018-12-16 03:18:25	@cmccabe	validate for something like $2 and you get all of it.
2018-12-16 03:19:09	~ben	heh that's fair
2018-12-16 03:19:13	fosslinux	^ thats some bullcrap
2018-12-16 03:19:13	@cmccabe	that's for historical reasons when the system got abused by spammers and blackhat haxnorz
2018-12-16 03:19:31	~ben	pretty reasonable tbh
2018-12-16 03:19:34	fosslinux	i've already got heaps of free tildes why would i use you
2018-12-16 03:19:36	~ben	sdf is kinda similar
2018-12-16 03:19:40	fosslinux	yeah
2018-12-16 03:19:47	@cmccabe	they should loosen those restrictiins no

2018-12-16 03:20:44	~khuxkm|lounge	yeah email
2018-12-16 03:21:10	fosslinux	sdf
2018-12-16 03:21:13	@cmccabe	i got validated at sdf by sending in a paper dollar, like 10+ years ago
2018-12-16 03:21:14	fosslinux	thats why i dont use sd
2018-12-16 03:22:13	mushmouth	mine was paypal cmccabe 
2018-12-16 03:22:23	~tomasino	you can also get validated on SDF by getting to know some users first and asking someone with meta to type "validate douchnozzle"
2018-12-16 03:22:32	~tomasino	for free
2018-12-16 03:22:52	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-16 03:22:53	mushmouth	tomasino: kind of what we have now with tilde verse
2018-12-16 03:23:03	~tomasino	btw, i would totally suggest douchenozzle (with an e) over douchnozzle if you want that name. I think it works better
2018-12-16 03:23:11	@cmccabe	douchnozzle went on to be a great sdf community member after he got validated
2018-12-16 03:23:26	~tomasino	it was a story for the ages
2018-12-16 03:24:30	~ben	who told you about me

2018-12-16 03:26:38	ahriman	I don't remember how I found it
2018-12-16 03:26:38	fosslinux	for me i found it through hashbang
2018-12-16 03:26:46	~tomasino	I think it involved Enya
2018-12-16 03:26:56	ahriman	Enya?!

2018-12-16 03:28:15	~tomasino	in reality, it was ben. He lured me into his van with candy and before I knew it I was scripting things in his little hole in the ground, putting the lotion on its skin, all of it
2018-12-16 03:29:06	~tomasino	cat: you click on that ASMR vid? I think you'd enjoy it even though it's not touchtone

2018-12-16 03:43:54	~khuxkm|lounge	well to a dedi box at least
2018-12-16 03:44:00	~khuxkm|lounge	the first one was to a VPS
2018-12-16 03:44:11	~tomasino	;) ben
2018-12-16 03:44:15	fosslinux	from?
2018-12-16 03:44:25	~khuxkm|lounge	idfk ask ben
2018-12-16 03:44:41	~tomasino	before hetzner? ben ran tilde.team in his head
2018-12-16 03:44:44	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-16 03:44:47	~tomasino	he sketched it out on paper really fast
2018-12-16 03:44:51	fosslinux	6gb -> 64 gb
2018-12-16 03:44:53	fosslinux	ram
2018-12-16 03:44:56	~tomasino	incredible stuff, but the headaches!
2018-12-16 03:45:03	~khuxkm|lounge	tomasino: no, he typed it into the computer
2018-12-16 03:45:12	~khuxkm|lounge	but yeah the headaches were probably terrible
2018-12-16 03:45:18	~tomasino	it was just ben running netcat and typing back to everyone in real time
2018-12-16 03:45:23	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-16 03:45:25	~khuxkm|lounge	so glad he got the VPS to lighten the load on himself
2018-12-16 03:45:36	~tomasino	seriously
2018-12-16 03:45:49	~khuxkm|lounge	to this day, though, the real mission-critical processes are ran in his head

2018-12-16 03:51:13	~tomasino	very quickly
2018-12-16 03:52:19	~khuxkm|lounge	my fault :P
2018-12-16 03:52:40	~khuxkm|lounge	one of the things I didn't bother implementing was CSRF protection
2018-12-16 03:53:10	~khuxkm|lounge	so you can write a script to upvote a quote into ridiculous numbers or downvote it into oblivion
2018-12-16 03:53:25	~tomasino	i prefer it that way
2018-12-16 03:53:52	~tomasino	that's how you get boaty mcboatface

2018-12-16 04:22:21	~ben	lol wow
2018-12-16 04:22:27	~ben	yes ~team was in my head before that vps
2018-12-16 04:22:32	~ben	but really
2018-12-16 04:22:37	~ben	it was on a 1gb linode
2018-12-16 04:22:56	~ben	then -> 6gb woothosting (which was a mistake)
2018-12-16 04:36:24	fosslinux	1GB????
2018-12-16 04:36:31	fosslinux	how did that even cope lol
2018-12-16 04:38:19	~khuxkm|lounge	not as many users back then, i'd assume
2018-12-16 04:38:28	~khuxkm|lounge	~town started as a t2.micro IIRC
2018-12-16 04:55:51	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-16 05:04:57	~ben	town is still only 4gb
2018-12-16 05:05:04	~ben	idk how it keeps up but it does!
2018-12-16 05:15:08	ahriman	it definitely needs a beefier server
2018-12-16 05:15:19	ahriman	all the load spikes and slowdowns it experiences
2018-12-16 05:28:28	~ben	yeah seriously

2018-12-16 05:44:44	~ben	full-width form is totally fine by me
2018-12-16 05:44:52	~ben	khuxkm|lounge: you could try putting it in a narrower col
2018-12-16 05:44:56	~ben	npa: nice!
2018-12-16 05:44:58	~khuxkm	yeah, something about amazon supports the military and that's a bad thing for some reason
2018-12-16 05:45:15	~ben	DO is still a bit pricey for my tastes but it's far cheaper than aws

2018-12-16 05:47:27	~khuxkm|lounge	actually thinking of making that its own repo and linking it to #hamradio instead

2018-12-16 05:47:47	npa	not 100% on it, but i remember him talking about it a while back ben
2018-12-16 05:47:56	~ben	what would you gain from making that its own repo?
2018-12-16 05:48:17	~khuxkm|lounge	"but that would require a rewrite of some parts of webhookbot" he began to type, before he realized it wouldn't take too much (hopefully)
2018-12-16 05:48:32	~ben	i don't have a problem with it

2018-12-16 06:02:18	~ben	lol what is going on with that page
2018-12-16 06:02:34	~ben	i'm half tempted to get a switch but maybe i'll just emulate it?
2018-12-16 06:02:36	~khuxkm|lounge	mushmouth: wrt Mario Party; I love the Mario block, since it eliminates 2 and 3 rolls
2018-12-16 06:02:43	~khuxkm|lounge	ben: switch emulation is so-so
2018-12-16 06:02:55	~khuxkm|lounge	from what I've heard
2018-12-16 06:03:09	mushmouth	khuxkm|lounge: sometimes you even get 0 and -3 or +3 coins
2018-12-16 06:03:09	~ben	probably relies heavily on single-thread
2018-12-16 06:03:10	~khuxkm|lounge	but it's worth the $300 launch price tag IMO
2018-12-16 06:03:18	~ben	heh fair enough
2018-12-16 06:03:28	~ben	i'm still considering sunk costs on my desktop though lol
2018-12-16 06:03:29	mushmouth	it's really neat
2018-12-16 06:03:46	~ben	and the last thing i put in it was the graphics card over a year ago
2018-12-16 06:03:48	~khuxkm|lounge	if we can get a dynarec on the Tegra you'll be able to emulate N64 full-speed on your Switch
2018-12-16 06:04:13	~khuxkm|lounge	one thing I would look for is possibly going on EBay and looking for a switch vulnerable to Fusee Gelee
2018-12-16 06:04:21	mushmouth	khuxkm|lounge: also i love how some mini games use the ally's as a benefit. it's neat
2018-12-16 06:04:28	~khuxkm|lounge	(the RCM bug)
2018-12-16 06:06:41	mushmouth	khuxkm|lounge: which mario party number would that be?\
2018-12-16 06:06:47	~ben	what's fuee gelle?
2018-12-16 06:06:52	~ben	fusee gelee*&

2018-12-16 06:09:14	~ben	oh wow nice
2018-12-16 06:11:31	~khuxkm|lounge	yeah, it's basically the key to homebrew forever on any firmware version on a vulnerable-hardware switch
2018-12-16 06:13:30	~ben	what do you need that for?
2018-12-16 06:14:20	~khuxkm|lounge	because software vulns can be patched out
2018-12-16 06:14:44	~khuxkm|lounge	and any switch coming out of factory has a version with (as far as we know) no software-level vulns
2018-12-16 06:14:57	~ben	no i mean what do you need homebrew for
2018-12-16 06:14:57	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-16 06:24:15	~khuxkm	emulation, etc.
2018-12-16 06:24:19	~khuxkm	also fan games
2018-12-16 06:24:29	~khuxkm	some really cool stuff is coming out

2018-12-16 07:22:30	robdrake	what is the 'institute'?
2018-12-16 07:23:03	ahriman	it's another tilde, focusing on providing a space for self-education with respect to OpenBSD
2018-12-16 07:23:27	robdrake	oh :/
2018-12-16 07:23:43	robdrake	I do not need the security of OpenBSD on my laptop
2018-12-16 07:24:09	robdrake	I know enough of OpenBSD to know that security is it's main focus

2018-12-16 07:27:56	robdrake	ben, when did somsubhra1 join? He may have been the member of my community that suggested to me tilde.team
2018-12-16 07:28:42	~ben	according to the signup mail that was late october
2018-12-16 07:28:50	robdrake	oh ok
2018-12-16 07:29:54	~ben	last i recall he was trying to get something set up with znc
2018-12-16 07:32:15	robdrake	yeah
2018-12-16 07:32:31	robdrake	he had to move his znc from my VPS

2018-12-16 07:36:04	~ben	oh ok cool
2018-12-16 07:43:47	ahriman	robdrake: the institute is less about trying to get everyone to use OpenBSD as it is just giving people a place to experiment and learn and develop
2018-12-16 07:44:07	robdrake	oh ok
2018-12-16 07:44:45	robdrake	I'm fine with linux, as I keep saying, "I'm a programmer type, not a sysadmin type"
2018-12-16 07:45:15	robdrake	if I'm forced to be a sysadmin, I have to be careful not to become BOFH out of agitation
2018-12-16 07:45:43	robdrake	my agitation is so bad I'm on 1mg Xanax 2x / day
2018-12-16 07:46:07	~ben	lol then feel free to leave the sysadmin stuff to me and ahriman 
2018-12-16 07:46:15	~ben	well on our respective tildes
2018-12-16 07:46:18	robdrake	gladly
2018-12-16 07:46:30	ahriman	yeah i enjoy that stuff
2018-12-16 07:47:12	robdrake	thanks to stackoverflow, I'm able to make quite a bit more progress on the node branch of my vote program
2018-12-16 07:47:34	robdrake	master was python, but I still need to move master to a python branch
2018-12-16 07:47:49	robdrake	the python part is dead
2018-12-16 07:49:43	~ben	a lot of things are pretty easy to translate between js and py
2018-12-16 07:49:57	robdrake	fudge
2018-12-16 07:50:25	robdrake	oh well, all that is really missing in the master / python branch is the python venv files
2018-12-16 07:51:03	robdrake	nevermind, was in the src directory
2018-12-16 07:55:58	~ben	python venv stuff should probably be in .gitignore
2018-12-16 07:56:03	~ben	iirc
2018-12-16 08:05:04	robdrake	it was
2018-12-16 08:06:01	robdrake	and it's now 2am here, I need to go to bed xor catnap, later

2018-12-16 12:35:06	robdrake	The nursing home I was in in Springfield took "Money Talks" to the extreme, I'm glad I was kicked out of there. That nursing home was not capable of handling improperly medicated mentally ill patients
2018-12-16 12:36:20	robdrake	My main problem, Mental Illness wise, is agitation
2018-12-16 12:37:46	robdrake	I'm rambling due to lack of sleep, I do need more sleep, or coffee
2018-12-16 12:38:10	robdrake	idk which yet, because breakfast is in roughly 30 minutes

2018-12-16 19:26:22	Fessus	Well, the other reason I can't have people here is because it's a 300 square foot studio apartment with no chairs or places to sit except the smelly one
2018-12-16 19:26:40	Fessus	I have a chair, a desk, and a bed. That's it

2018-12-17 05:27:38	fosslinux	let me see if i can help :)
2018-12-17 05:28:39	fosslinux	why would you want to deduplicate the users if they have multiple sessions?
2018-12-17 05:29:29	~ahriman	because i only want each user to appear once on the connected users list on the site
2018-12-17 05:29:45	~ahriman	thanks for the help fosslinux
2018-12-17 05:29:47	robdrake	use a dictionary?
2018-12-17 05:30:11	~ahriman	i could use a dictionary, i figured there was a less roundabout way
2018-12-17 05:30:30	fosslinux	oh
2018-12-17 05:31:15	fosslinux	in the list, how many items are there?
2018-12-17 05:31:27	fosslinux	they're correctly split?
2018-12-17 05:33:21	fosslinux	ahriman: 
2018-12-17 05:33:27	~ahriman	the number of items varies, and it's not splitting by line. you can see the output on https://tilde.institute/stats
2018-12-17 05:33:44	~ahriman	im just now learning python so im new at this
2018-12-17 05:34:28	login	python has sets too right?
2018-12-17 05:34:29	~ahriman	under "connected users"
2018-12-17 05:34:44	login	you can split by space
2018-12-17 05:34:45	fosslinux	ok
2018-12-17 05:34:47	login	that should work right?
2018-12-17 05:35:18	fosslinux	yes login is correct you need a set

2018-12-17 05:36:21	login	set would work really well, and leave it up to python to determine how to deduplicate
2018-12-17 05:36:24	fosslinux	when defining connusers, put set() around the entire expression that you are defining connusers with
2018-12-17 05:36:33	fosslinux	try that
2018-12-17 05:36:54	login	or you could define Remove(duplicate) as follows:
2018-12-17 05:36:59	login	def Remove(duplicate):
2018-12-17 05:37:05	login	    return set(duplicate)
2018-12-17 05:37:09	login	Or even
2018-12-17 05:37:15	login	return list(set(duplicate))
2018-12-17 05:37:26	fosslinux	^^ even better
2018-12-17 05:38:30	~ahriman	updated git repo with the changes, same output
2018-12-17 05:39:02	login	Also, .splitlines() would have to be replaced with
2018-12-17 05:39:51	fosslinux	really weird
2018-12-17 05:40:07	~ahriman	close!
2018-12-17 05:40:10	~ahriman	hang on
2018-12-17 05:40:18	login	Also, why would one need to wrap .decode() in str?
2018-12-17 05:40:34	fosslinux	^
2018-12-17 05:40:46	fosslinux	      if "#" not in conn:
2018-12-17 05:40:48	fosslinux	why this line
2018-12-17 05:41:01	login	because #users=3
2018-12-17 05:41:09	login	i logged into tilde.institute and ran who -q
2018-12-17 05:41:20	login	a better solution would be to take only the first line
2018-12-17 05:41:39	login	So .splitlines()[0].split()
2018-12-17 05:41:47	login	instead of splitlines()
2018-12-17 05:41:58	login	But there may be better ways to get the first lien
2018-12-17 05:44:08	login	Also, better to use /usr/bin/who in the command than just who
2018-12-17 05:44:29	login	because depending on how this python file is run, the environment could be manipulated to change what 'who' executes
2018-12-17 05:45:04	login	i mean, it shouldn' normally be possible though, and it would be much safer to run python in isolated mode (you'd have to change the hashbang to use python -I instead of just python)
2018-12-17 05:47:46	~ahriman	login i made those changes w/r/t shebang/path

2018-12-17 05:50:09	sedbot	<fosslinux> nice work login
2018-12-17 05:55:43	login	thank you
2018-12-17 05:56:11	login	ahriman: you don't need to set(), then do Remove
2018-12-17 05:56:23	login	also, str() should not be necessary after .decode()
2018-12-17 05:56:46	login	So:
2018-12-17 05:57:08	login	    connusers = set(subprocess.check_output("/usr/bin/who -q; exit 0", stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,shell=True).decode().splitlines()[0].split())
2018-12-17 05:57:18	login	    users = list(connusers)
2018-12-17 05:57:20	~ahriman	oh alright, that makes sense
2018-12-17 05:57:32	login	And you can remove def Remove(duplicate): ...
2018-12-17 05:57:50	login	because you'd be doing list(set(set(stuff))) in effect otherwise
2018-12-17 05:58:23	login	which would work
2018-12-17 05:58:34	login	but would have redundant computation...
2018-12-17 05:58:51	fosslinux	heyyyyyyy wattttt
2018-12-17 05:59:02	fosslinux	does aws not have an always free t2.micro instance??????
2018-12-17 05:59:09	login	not an always free
2018-12-17 05:59:11	login	only 1 year free
2018-12-17 05:59:16	fosslinux	crappppp
2018-12-17 05:59:43	login	but if you can easily move it from machine to machine
2018-12-17 05:59:51	fosslinux	kk
2018-12-17 05:59:51	login	you can register new amazon accounts every year
2018-12-17 05:59:56	login	and move dns over
2018-12-17 06:00:07	login	but you'd need new credit-card details for every new account
2018-12-17 06:00:21	login	i think they don't allow the free instance without giving one's credit-card away

2018-12-17 06:00:39	fosslinux	ahriman: you put "from sys import exit" but then you use sys.exit()
2018-12-17 06:00:46	fosslinux	no need
2018-12-17 06:00:47	TildeBot	no u infinity fosslinux
2018-12-17 06:00:54	fosslinux	just do import sys instead
2018-12-17 06:01:02	login	ah yeah, that's a good catch fosslinux
2018-12-17 06:01:03	fosslinux	or just exit()
2018-12-17 06:01:24	login	I mean, one could also do from sys import exit as sys_exit
2018-12-17 06:01:28	login	then do sys_exit()
2018-12-17 06:01:43	login	But python doesn't import all of sys when doing "from sys import exit" righ?
2018-12-17 06:01:46	login	*right
2018-12-17 06:01:56	fosslinux	no
2018-12-17 06:01:57	TildeBot	no u infinity fosslinux
2018-12-17 06:02:00	fosslinux	it dosen't
2018-12-17 06:02:13	fosslinux	one last thing
2018-12-17 06:02:16	fosslinux	if __name__=='__main__':
2018-12-17 06:02:18	login	i don't think it imports all of sys even when doing "import sys" right?
2018-12-17 06:02:27	fosslinux	well it does
2018-12-17 06:02:33	fosslinux	but then you would have to use sys.exit for example
2018-12-17 06:02:56	fosslinux	if __name__=='__main__': - python standards say that spaces before and after the ==
2018-12-17 06:02:59	login	so speed-wise/memory-wise there is no penatly for "import sys" compared to "from sys import exit"?
2018-12-17 06:03:11	fosslinux	hmmm no afaik?
2018-12-17 06:03:58	login	Also, the __name__=='__main__' would only be needed if one wanted to distinguish between importing vs running directly

2018-12-17 06:04:34	login	Also, i wish there were a way to "push" updates to web pages from servers
2018-12-17 06:04:38	fosslinux	login: true. i just tend to put it in all the time just in case i do a whoops or someone else tries to use my code
2018-12-17 06:04:45	fosslinux	whats that mean login
2018-12-17 06:05:08	login	Meaning, instead of updating every five minutes and my having to refresh the web page to see changes in the number of connected users
2018-12-17 06:05:22	login	i wish there were a way for the server to "push" updates to the number of connected users to tilde.town/stats
2018-12-17 06:05:23	fosslinux	oh
2018-12-17 06:05:29	fosslinux	rite
2018-12-17 06:05:41	login	so that if i connected, i would instantly (without refresh) see a change
2018-12-17 06:05:54	~ben	that's called javascript
2018-12-17 06:05:56	~ben	plus php
2018-12-17 06:05:58	login	I think Google used to use iframes and keep-alive connections to do this kind of thing once...
2018-12-17 06:06:03	login	How does php do push?
2018-12-17 06:06:11	login	And I thought js would mean polling
2018-12-17 06:06:11	~ben	it doesn't
2018-12-17 06:06:38	~ben	yes that's how you'd do it
2018-12-17 06:07:43	fosslinux	iframes--
2018-12-17 06:07:52	fosslinux	iframes are not good
2018-12-17 06:09:41	~ben	oh
2018-12-17 06:10:45	fosslinux	just oh lol
2018-12-17 06:10:56	~ben	don't look at https://tilde.team then
2018-12-17 06:10:56	fosslinux	but in all seriousness
2018-12-17 06:10:57	TildeBot	tilde.team https://bhh.sh/2l0
2018-12-17 06:11:06	fosslinux	they don't work very well with modern browsers
2018-12-17 06:11:11	fosslinux	or css
2018-12-17 06:11:36	fosslinux	lol you only have one
2018-12-17 06:11:37	~ben	css is the worst part tbh
2018-12-17 06:11:45	~ben	ye for the masto feed
2018-12-17 06:12:11	fosslinux	lol thats probably fine
2018-12-17 06:13:25	fosslinux	i've seen sites where the ENTIRE page is an iframe
2018-12-17 06:13:30	~ben	yo
2018-12-17 06:13:34	fosslinux	and they layout stuff using iframes
2018-12-17 06:13:47	~ben	who would be interested in a tildverse jackbox night
2018-12-17 06:13:53	~ben	how bout no
2018-12-17 06:13:53	fosslinux	jackbox?
2018-12-17 06:13:57	~ben	ye
2018-12-17 06:14:03	~ben	i can stream
2018-12-17 06:14:14	fosslinux	lol when would we do it when everyone is on lol
2018-12-17 06:14:17	~ben	evry1 else can play on their phone/compooper
2018-12-17 06:14:33	fosslinux	nice idea
2018-12-17 06:15:20	login	What's a jackbox?
2018-12-17 06:15:35	login	Also, is there any way to "push" to web pages instead of the web page polling the server?
2018-12-17 06:16:05	~ben	i can do monday tuesday or wednesay between 2200 and 0600 utc

2018-12-17 06:16:46	login	Ah, websockets
2018-12-17 06:17:02	login	How does Google Chat work, if not using WebSockets?
2018-12-17 06:18:02	~ben	where did google chat come from
2018-12-17 06:18:19	~ben	rather: why did that come up now
2018-12-17 06:22:53	npa	http longpolling, or ajax queries
2018-12-17 06:22:56	npa	@ login
2018-12-17 06:23:13	npa	just read your question, so the former
2018-12-17 06:23:25	npa	the latter is polling, while the former... is just kinda a long request
2018-12-17 06:28:18	login	the former would be the most compatible way of making it update in real time
2018-12-17 06:28:54	login	ben: the context is that one-way google chat is like receiving information about connected users from the server
2018-12-17 06:29:07	login	this is regarding tilde.institute/stats
2018-12-17 06:30:17	~ahriman	tbh im cool with a 5min cron job

2018-12-17 06:49:13	npa	can't remember the last time a double click was necessary
2018-12-17 06:49:19	npa	when did they go out of fashion
2018-12-17 06:50:20	~ahriman	1998
2018-12-17 06:50:58	npa	can't remember 1998 either, checks out
2018-12-17 06:56:43	login	Lol, so two tries is too many?
2018-12-17 06:57:12	login	I know at least one person that double-clicks where a single click will do
2018-12-17 07:01:01	~ahriman	is that person you, login?
2018-12-17 07:02:30	fosslinux	lol i only single clicked it but nothing happened so i clicked it again
2018-12-17 07:02:46	npa	little do we know that fosslinux is a serial carder
2018-12-17 07:03:05	fosslinux	you still need doulble clicks for file managers
2018-12-17 07:03:24	npa	implying i have files to manage
2018-12-17 07:03:28	fosslinux	lol
2018-12-17 07:03:33	fosslinux	some people do
2018-12-17 07:03:36	npa	yeah you're right tho
2018-12-17 07:14:25	~ahriman	i don't use a file manager
2018-12-17 07:15:24	+jan6	02:14:25       ~ahriman | i don't use a file manager
2018-12-17 07:15:26	+jan6	lol
2018-12-17 07:22:58	fosslinux	lol neither do i
2018-12-17 07:23:07	fosslinux	90% of the time
2018-12-17 07:23:24	fosslinux	9% of the time i'm in windows
2018-12-17 07:23:31	fosslinux	the other 1% i use a file manager in linux
2018-12-17 07:23:41	fosslinux	that 90% is the cmd line ftw
2018-12-17 07:23:42	~ahriman	jan6: i don't, everything i do is just via mv/cp/whatever and i don't use windows or macos
2018-12-17 07:23:52	fosslinux	^ same
2018-12-17 07:24:10	~ahriman	i have ranger installed but literally never use it
2018-12-17 07:24:21	fosslinux	do you have gui ahriman 
2018-12-17 07:24:42	~ahriman	are you asking if i use xwindows? because yes i do
2018-12-17 07:25:26	fosslinux	what do you use x for?
2018-12-17 07:25:34	~ahriman	firefox
2018-12-17 07:25:47	fosslinux	same the only thing i use gui for is my web browser
2018-12-17 07:25:52	fosslinux	ungoogled chromium
2018-12-17 07:26:17	~ahriman	i also sometimes do something small in like gimp or something
2018-12-17 07:26:22	fosslinux	sure
2018-12-17 07:26:40	~ahriman	but the vast majority of the time it's firefox, and a bunch of terms
2018-12-17 07:26:56	fosslinux	terms?
2018-12-17 07:27:01	~ahriman	terminals
2018-12-17 07:27:10	~ahriman	xterms
2018-12-17 07:27:15	fosslinux	xterm???!??

2018-12-17 07:28:08	~ahriman	it's much better for a laptop OS than freebsd was
2018-12-17 07:28:30	fosslinux	lol yea
2018-12-17 07:33:21	~ahriman	like i can actually use my sd card reader now holy shit

2018-12-17 07:44:02	fosslinux	lol now i need to generate a new key :grimace:
2018-12-17 07:44:18	fosslinux	because someone took my lappy a few days ago and was mucking havoc with it
2018-12-17 07:44:37	fosslinux	lol they had no idea wat they were doing but im not running a risk
2018-12-17 07:44:39	+jan6	wut?
2018-12-17 07:45:25	fosslinux	loom at my blog
2018-12-17 07:45:39	fosslinux	but the jist is that i need a new pgp key
2018-12-17 07:45:46	fosslinux	because it may have been compromised
2018-12-17 07:45:51	fosslinux	i rarely used it anyway tho

2018-12-17 07:47:43	login	ahriman: no, i don't do that
2018-12-17 07:49:31	login	ahriman: so you don't use nautilus on ubuntu?
2018-12-17 07:50:15	login	ahriman: can one use subkeys without the pgp master key?
2018-12-17 07:53:07	~ahriman	i don't use ubuntu
2018-12-17 07:53:17	~ahriman	also yes you can use the subkeys without the master
2018-12-17 07:53:24	login	Well, then the debian equivalent of Nautilus
2018-12-17 07:53:54	~ahriman	it's DE specific, not OS-specific, i use i3 which doesn't have a file manager and i never installed nautilus
2018-12-17 07:53:58	login	caja? dolphin?
2018-12-17 07:54:02	~ahriman	no no
2018-12-17 07:54:03	TildeBot	no u infinity ahriman
2018-12-17 07:54:23	login	DE = distro?
2018-12-17 07:54:27	login	or distributino environment?

2018-12-17 07:55:12	+jan6	^
2018-12-17 07:55:13	login	ah, i3 = tiling wm
2018-12-17 07:55:25	~ahriman	yep
2018-12-17 07:55:42	login	Wayland vs X-server?
2018-12-17 07:55:49	~ahriman	i use Xorg
2018-12-17 07:55:53	login	also, what's a meta-package?
2018-12-17 07:56:00	+jan6	some use pcmanfm cause it's light, others use their custom version of nautilus (caja and dolphin both are pretty much the same thing afaik)
2018-12-17 07:56:09	~ahriman	a meta-package allows you to install groups of packages at once
2018-12-17 07:56:15	+jan6	^
2018-12-17 07:56:47	+jan6	apt install build-essentials -> apt install gcc g++ make etc
2018-12-17 07:56:53	~ahriman	yep
2018-12-17 07:57:11	+jan6	pretty nifty little feature
2018-12-17 07:57:31	login	Ah, so that's what build-essentials was
2018-12-17 07:58:26	~ahriman	yup :)
2018-12-17 07:58:37	+jan6	also often used for stuff like "apt install python" to install a default version, for python it's py2, otherwise tends to be latest version
2018-12-17 07:59:11	+jan6	how were you confused about build-essentials, login? did you not read what it installed? ;P
2018-12-17 07:59:19	login	Is it better to teach C++ to high-school students in their penultimate year of high-school (and ultimate year) or Python 2?
2018-12-17 07:59:35	login	I just followed a guide when i needed build-essentials to get something going
2018-12-17 07:59:59	login	I mean, what would be the difference between a meta-package and a package that also leads to the installation of dependencies
2018-12-17 08:00:19	login	other than a package that is itself a dud with dependencies = meta-package
2018-12-17 08:00:31	~ahriman	jan6: do you recall how to get the Ctrl-Shift-C/V shortcuts working in xterm on debian for copy/paste? it was enabled by default on freebsd and I'm having a hell of a time figuring it out
2018-12-17 08:00:32	+jan6	meta-package IS only dependencies, no other difference afaik
2018-12-17 08:00:46	+jan6	ctrl-alt-c/v? ;P
2018-12-17 08:01:10	~ahriman	that doesn't work
2018-12-17 08:01:12	+jan6	at least that's what should work for rxvt
2018-12-17 08:01:33	+jan6	I see no reason to use xterm over rxvt anyway
2018-12-17 08:01:35	~ahriman	maybe i'll switch to urxvt
2018-12-17 08:01:52	+jan6	just use the linux copying system then, maybe? lol
2018-12-17 08:02:01	+jan6	highlight + middlemouse to paste
2018-12-17 08:02:18	+jan6	highlight-to-copy + middlemouse-to-paste

2018-12-17 10:05:42	+jan6	lol
2018-12-17 10:06:02	~ahriman	?
2018-12-17 10:06:05	+jan6	st ain't to bad, but it lacks a few things by default, which is it's goal I guess
2018-12-17 10:06:18	~ahriman	im accustomed to it
2018-12-17 10:06:33	~ahriman	used it for the last year and a half or so
2018-12-17 10:07:44	+jan6	I guess technically any terminal that shows text, and supports the 4-bit colors or stuff works (if it supports the othr sequences then even better)
2018-12-17 10:08:11	~ahriman	word
2018-12-17 10:08:20	+jan6	3/4-bit being the 8-color palette
2018-12-17 10:08:48	~ahriman	well i need to get some sleep, peace jan6 
2018-12-17 10:09:06	+jan6	imo the "8-colors + faint + bright/bold + reverse" give quite a reasonable pallette of colors and stuff
2018-12-17 10:09:08	+jan6	night for you
2018-12-17 10:09:15	+jan6	it's midday here, lol

2018-12-17 10:16:10	+jan6	oof
2018-12-17 10:16:52	+jan6	it's the b3n-time that's default timezone of the server, so you must be around the murica
2018-12-17 10:25:05	+jan6	if only unicode shaded block drawing characters were a thing
2018-12-17 10:25:08	+jan6	if only
2018-12-17 10:26:06	+jan6	I guess the way to get them would be using those "private area" codepoints...too bad they won't add 'em to the standard
2018-12-17 10:29:58	+jan6	at LEAST shaded variants of the half-block, dammit, so we can make cool utf-8-pixelart
2018-12-17 11:22:26	npa	half block as in ▄?
2018-12-17 11:24:43	+jan6	doesn't matter if top or bottom, but yeah
2018-12-17 11:25:30	+jan6	that'd allow for at least decent pixel art without using 256 colors or stuff
2018-12-17 11:26:06	+jan6	which, I know, nearly all stuff supports by now anyway, but still
2018-12-17 11:26:49	 *	jan6 wonders how much of the ansi codes st supports...

2018-12-17 12:26:42	npa	yeah jan6, you can get the top half just by setting the background of it accordingly
2018-12-17 13:05:12	+jan6	no you can't
2018-12-17 13:05:12	TildeBot	no u infinity jan6
2018-12-17 13:05:29	+jan6	what I mean is the shading blocks
2018-12-17 13:05:36	+jan6	but shaped
2018-12-17 13:05:51	+jan6	U+2591 ░ Light shade U+2592 ▒ Medium shade U+2593 ▓ Dark shade
2018-12-17 13:06:19	+jan6	but in the shape of half-block and preferrably all other block drawing chars
2018-12-17 13:06:30	arne	owo
2018-12-17 13:06:56	+jan6	(light and dark is assuming black font, of course)
2018-12-17 13:08:43	+jan6	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements as you can see, technically you could draw 4 "sub-pixels" into one char, but only one of 2 colors (fg/bg)
2018-12-17 13:08:43	TildeBot	Block Elements - Wikipedia https://bhh.sh/2l3
2018-12-17 13:09:11	+jan6	the half-block is especially cool tho, cause it's pretty much one pixel
2018-12-17 13:09:37	+jan6	well, one square unit
2018-12-17 13:10:00	+jan6	which is much better than the 1x2 regular characters for art
2018-12-17 13:10:49	+jan6	but where you can shade a full character space using the "shade characters", you can't shade these sub-character blocks, sadly

2018-12-17 15:53:05	login	rpg
2018-12-17 15:53:17	login	The penalties are of the form 20*(1.14^(YOUR_LEVEL)) 
2018-12-17 15:53:18	+jan6	it has with your calc
2018-12-17 15:53:30	+jan6	no possibility of going negative
2018-12-17 15:53:31	TildeBot	no u infinity jan6
2018-12-17 15:53:33	login	1.14^(YOUR LEVEL) = exp(ln(1.14) * YOUR LEVEL)
2018-12-17 15:53:52	login	So in order to go negative, you need ln(1.14)*YOUR_LEVEL to be a complex number
2018-12-17 15:54:25	login	how do penalties affect YOUR_LEVEL?
2018-12-17 15:54:46	login	If it's by any of the operations, then real numbers are cloesd, so you can't get complex numbers into YOUR_LEVEL

2018-12-17 16:43:24	login	i mean, each politician or even party cannot unilaterally make anything worth promising happen
2018-12-17 16:44:13	login	and the opposition especially doesn't want the promises of those in power to be fulfilled... for election purposes

2018-12-17 17:33:42	%ubergeek	They are typically considered outcasts
2018-12-17 17:34:02	%ubergeek	Probably due to the fact that humans are very social priates

2018-12-17 20:13:15	+jan6	can't think of anything I could do in my free time 1) reliably, and 2) not very time-sensitively, so I'd be able to take a week off

2018-12-18 04:39:04	~ben	.04 load
2018-12-18 04:39:28	sose	Literally haven't touched it since starting it so idk how its doing
2018-12-18 04:39:41	~ben	lol
2018-12-18 04:39:42	~ben	oh wait
2018-12-18 04:39:50	~ben	i restarted this vps like a day ago
2018-12-18 04:40:02	sose	Oh lol yea then its down
2018-12-18 04:40:07	~ben	systemd unit when
2018-12-18 04:40:37	sose	Good idea
2018-12-18 04:40:46	~ben	just do loginctl enable-linger
2018-12-18 04:40:51	~ben	run a user unit
2018-12-18 04:40:59	~ben	just in case
2018-12-18 04:41:01	sose	I need to do that for my other servers too
2018-12-18 04:41:07	~ben	can't hurt tbh
2018-12-18 04:41:55	sose	I hate having to start 2 tmux windows, 7 panes and 5 http servers every time my web server reboots
2018-12-18 04:42:01	~ben	omfg
2018-12-18 04:42:02	sose	@
2018-12-18 04:42:04	~ben	screw that
2018-12-18 04:42:18	~ben	that's insane
2018-12-18 04:42:25	sose	Its not common, but it is annoying
2018-12-18 04:42:31	~ben	ya srsly
2018-12-18 04:42:53	~ben	i don't have to start anything manually rn and it's great
2018-12-18 04:42:59	~ben	well i lied
2018-12-18 04:43:05	~ben	i have to restart my autossh tunnels
2018-12-18 04:43:07	~ahriman	gasp
2018-12-18 04:43:09	~ben	and weechat
2018-12-18 04:43:26	~ben	but they're in my fish autocomplete history so i just start typing autossh and it completes the rest
2018-12-18 04:43:33	~ahriman	i serviceified my tunnel to ~town
2018-12-18 04:43:41	~ben	that's what autossh does 
2018-12-18 04:43:49	~ben	i guess i just need to OneShot those at boot
2018-12-18 04:43:58	~ahriman	word
2018-12-18 04:44:22	~ben	autossh handles forking and keeping that up on its own so i wouldn't need systemd to do that
2018-12-18 04:44:22	npa	whew, nice
2018-12-18 04:44:26	sose	Hey since we're talking about servers does anyone know how to set up an Ethernet connection with /etc/network/interfaces on debian?
2018-12-18 04:44:38	~ben	tbh systemd is really great at doing services
2018-12-18 04:44:39	npa	i haven't even set up my lxc container to restart on reboot lol
2018-12-18 04:44:43	~ahriman	yeh
2018-12-18 04:44:45	~ahriman	sose
2018-12-18 04:44:50	~ben	npa: that should do it manually
2018-12-18 04:44:52	~ben	sose: try nmvli
2018-12-18 04:44:54	~ben	s/v/c
2018-12-18 04:44:54	sedbot	<ben> sose: try nmcli
2018-12-18 04:45:19	sose	I didnt want to use networkmanager, since the machines are in a LAN
2018-12-18 04:45:24	npa	why doesn't it pick it up automatically sose?
2018-12-18 04:45:28	sose	Idk
2018-12-18 04:45:35	~ahriman	sose im about to send you my /interfaces file
2018-12-18 04:45:38	~ben	eth is usually autoconfigured in my experience
2018-12-18 04:46:03	sose	It seemed to be on arch too, maybe debian is different?
2018-12-18 04:46:17	~ahriman	sose: https://bin.tilde.team/zdpg just replicate the auto, etc for the enp interface like i have for the wlp interface
2018-12-18 04:46:21	~ben	i have debian on all my home machines and i've never had to do that
2018-12-18 04:46:37	npa	^ neither
2018-12-18 04:46:37	sose	hmm
2018-12-18 04:46:44	npa	what does ifconfig say?
2018-12-18 04:46:53	~ahriman	so remove allow-hotplug and put in auto enp00s0
2018-12-18 04:47:06	~ben	lol ifconfig not found
2018-12-18 04:47:07	sose	Im not at the machine rn
2018-12-18 04:47:17	sose	Ill try that config though
2018-12-18 04:47:22	~ahriman	word
2018-12-18 04:47:31	sose	I was setting a static ip though
2018-12-18 04:47:43	npa	ben: ip link list
2018-12-18 04:47:52	~ahriman	sose: man interfaces has info on static ips
2018-12-18 04:47:58	~ahriman	and examples
2018-12-18 04:48:03	~ben	even with the static ip on my pi and my media server i didn't have to do anything to configure eth
2018-12-18 04:48:23	~ben	https://ttm.sh/Ps.txt
2018-12-18 04:48:46	npa	 nice
2018-12-18 04:49:43	~ahriman	ben: you didn't have to configure /interfaces?
2018-12-18 04:49:57	~ben	lol no
2018-12-18 04:50:03	~ben	maybe i did and i'm just completely blanking
2018-12-18 04:50:05	~ahriman	oh it probably autoconfigured during install
2018-12-18 04:50:10	sose	I did the stuff in the man pages
2018-12-18 04:50:22	~ben	oh actually i used wifi during the install on that box
2018-12-18 04:50:28	~ahriman	sose did you start dhcpcd.service
2018-12-18 04:50:34	~ahriman	oh nvm static
2018-12-18 04:50:37	~ahriman	d'oh
2018-12-18 04:51:12	npa	this is my bad boy: https://ttm.sh/P9.txt
2018-12-18 04:51:15	~ben	ok is it minecraft time
2018-12-18 04:51:43	~ben	i think i actually set a static ip on the router end
2018-12-18 04:51:56	sose	The furthest I got was connecting with a static ip and when I tried to ping anything I got an error
2018-12-18 04:52:02	~ahriman	sose: did you enable networking.service and ifup@enp0s31f6.service
2018-12-18 04:52:02	npa	yeah i set up a static ip for my pi on my router too
2018-12-18 04:52:10	~ahriman	sose did you set up /etc/resolv.conf too
2018-12-18 04:52:26	npa	i didn't realise you could set it on a computer and the router would obey when assigning IPs
2018-12-18 04:52:27	~ben	oh yeah /etc/resolv.conf somehow went missing on my mediaserver 
2018-12-18 04:52:45	npa	that seems like a security risk or something
2018-12-18 04:52:51	~ahriman	npa yeh i do that with some things, the router's like "oh okay hoss"
2018-12-18 04:52:56	~ben	what's a security risk?
2018-12-18 04:53:04	npa	when you lose your stocks
2018-12-18 04:53:15	~ben	i use my pi as the resolver and dhcp server for my whole lan
2018-12-18 04:53:23	sose	I didn't setup resolv.conf, maybe that was it?
2018-12-18 04:53:26	~ben	so i have the pi get its own static ip 
2018-12-18 04:53:27	npa	but the router just obeying computers to assign ips to mac addresses
2018-12-18 04:53:30	~ahriman	oh you use a pihole don't you
2018-12-18 04:53:33	npa	like a voluntary arp spoof ben
2018-12-18 04:53:33	~ahriman	sose that's it
2018-12-18 04:53:35	~ben	pihole <3
2018-12-18 04:53:38	~ben	oof
2018-12-18 04:53:47	~ahriman	sose: nameserver 1.1.1.1 and nameserver 1.0.0.1 on separate lines
2018-12-18 04:53:51	sose	aha
2018-12-18 04:54:03	npa	wait, resolve.conf is autogenerated on debian
2018-12-18 04:54:07	npa	that will be lost
2018-12-18 04:54:13	npa	you have to change networkmanager or something
2018-12-18 04:54:19	~ben	depends on what you use to configure networking 
2018-12-18 04:54:26	~ahriman	so set chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf if it gets overwritten
2018-12-18 04:54:32	npa	lol ahriman
2018-12-18 04:54:33	~ahriman	hacky but works

2018-12-18 06:13:16	~ahriman	yes
2018-12-18 06:14:07	mushmouth	ahriman: what did you think of the schirpernia?
2018-12-18 06:14:09	mushmouth	kind of twist
2018-12-18 06:15:49	slipyx	spoiler alert
2018-12-18 06:16:10	mushmouth	oops
2018-12-18 06:18:28	mushmouth	slipyx: i found that twist to be very interesting because i have it diagnosed
2018-12-18 06:19:16	npa	was it schitzophrenia?
2018-12-18 06:19:17	~ahriman	schirpernia?
2018-12-18 06:19:27	npa	i thought it was multiple personality disorder or borderline-pd
2018-12-18 06:19:35	npa	in fight club, that is
2018-12-18 06:19:38	mushmouth	schizophrenia
2018-12-18 06:19:54	~ahriman	ive known people w/ schizophrenia and found the movie to totally movie-fy it and made the portrayal unrealistic
2018-12-18 06:19:55	mushmouth	i think the people were real. i think there was only like 2-3 people who were fake
2018-12-18 06:20:21	mushmouth	ahriman: as someone with it. i feel it to be very accurate
2018-12-18 06:20:29	~ahriman	rly?
2018-12-18 06:20:32	mushmouth	and talk to people who have it as well
2018-12-18 06:20:34	mushmouth	yeah
2018-12-18 06:20:36	~ahriman	ill trust your judgement
2018-12-18 06:20:45	~ahriman	because i don't have it
2018-12-18 06:20:51	~ahriman	so i don't know what it's like
2018-12-18 06:20:53	mushmouth	i was diagnosed around 17-18
2018-12-18 06:20:59	mushmouth	there different degrees of it
2018-12-18 06:21:05	mushmouth	so not everyone has the same experience
2018-12-18 06:21:27	~ahriman	i have bipolar disorder
2018-12-18 06:21:36	mushmouth	im on the high spectrum of autism
2018-12-18 06:21:55	npa	have we already bonded over this ahriman
2018-12-18 06:22:01	~ahriman	maybe
2018-12-18 06:22:03	mushmouth	along with my syndrome which i am missing a chromzoone called 22q
2018-12-18 06:22:12	mushmouth	missing chromozone from birth
2018-12-18 06:23:08	~ahriman	interesting
2018-12-18 06:23:19	~ahriman	i didn't know what that was before i just googled it
2018-12-18 06:23:21	mushmouth	it based offof digeorge
2018-12-18 06:23:29	mushmouth	it used to be just called digeorge

2018-12-18 06:24:49	mushmouth	i was trying to become a female at the time
2018-12-18 06:24:58	~ahriman	npa i am mostly medicated, though I've run out of my mood stabilizers
2018-12-18 06:25:00	mushmouth	my back was hurting all the time
2018-12-18 06:25:10	mushmouth	was dealing with people making fun of me due to my voice
2018-12-18 06:25:37	~ahriman	mushmouth do you still question your gender?
2018-12-18 06:25:42	mushmouth	no
2018-12-18 06:25:43	TildeBot	no u infinity mushmouth
2018-12-18 06:25:46	~ahriman	if you don't mind me asking
2018-12-18 06:25:49	mushmouth	but people think i'm hiding it now ahriman 
2018-12-18 06:26:10	mushmouth	at least the ones who knew me
2018-12-18 06:26:38	mushmouth	the reason i stopped is that i discovered you had to take medication every day
2018-12-18 06:26:48	mushmouth	and i'm already taking like 1-6 medication for illness and stuff
2018-12-18 06:26:51	mushmouth	don't want to add more
2018-12-18 06:27:01	mushmouth	probably in the 10's for medication now
2018-12-18 06:27:19	mushmouth	if i truly cared to change my gender. im not trying to stop anyone i would take them
2018-12-18 06:27:23	mushmouth	but it wasn't in my mindset
2018-12-18 06:27:29	npa	man i can't even imagine that much medication
2018-12-18 06:27:38	npa	do you have one of those webster pak's?
2018-12-18 06:27:45	mushmouth	webster?
2018-12-18 06:28:00	npa	like those containers that have slots for each day
2018-12-18 06:28:04	mushmouth	yeah
2018-12-18 06:28:11	mushmouth	and it gets really annoying and disgusting to see them
2018-12-18 06:28:47	npa	yeah i can imagine
2018-12-18 06:28:53	npa	sometimes they have a taste
2018-12-18 06:29:01	mushmouth	ive been taking medication for as long as i can remember
2018-12-18 06:29:04	mushmouth	probably under 13
2018-12-18 06:29:05	npa	i remember some anti-d's i had a while back tasted like aniseed
2018-12-18 06:29:11	mushmouth	im 23 now
2018-12-18 06:29:23	npa	and yeah ahriman, i'm on mood stabs and anti-psychs atm
2018-12-18 06:29:28	mushmouth	in order for me to function like a normal human i need it
2018-12-18 06:29:34	mushmouth	other wise i can get paranoid
2018-12-18 06:29:40	mushmouth	and have worse schizo then what i have now
2018-12-18 06:30:03	~ahriman	npa what are you on? i take effexor, abilify, seroquel, gabapentin
2018-12-18 06:30:42	~ahriman	the effexor is because i don't swing down to 'normal' i swing down to 'depressed af'
2018-12-18 06:30:49	mushmouth	plus i was on one medication that was suppose to help my eye lock ups. when i went to a room with bright lights. my eyes would just go up for like hours or sometimes i just start swearing because lights really bother me
2018-12-18 06:31:13	~ahriman	mushmouth do you know what causes the photosensitivity
2018-12-18 06:31:19	npa	seroquel xr, and lamotragine
2018-12-18 06:31:29	mushmouth	i need the room to be dark and black background and white text to get it. even hearing people sometimes gets annoying after awhile and i just need a break
2018-12-18 06:31:31	~ahriman	lamictal?
2018-12-18 06:31:36	mushmouth	ahriman: yes just due to sensitive eyes
2018-12-18 06:31:41	npa	lamotrigine, rather
2018-12-18 06:31:46	mushmouth	i need glasses or sun glasses
2018-12-18 06:32:02	~ahriman	npa seroquel is potent shit. i hate it.
2018-12-18 06:32:07	npa	i'm on the XR
2018-12-18 06:32:12	npa	which is the extended release one

2018-12-18 06:32:27	npa	hey, it means you can instantly fall asleep
2018-12-18 06:32:30	npa	a useful skill
2018-12-18 06:32:33	mushmouth	ahriman: so there was a thing i had to do to test my eyes and such and i do just have natural senisitive eyes
2018-12-18 06:32:35	~ahriman	yes this is true
2018-12-18 06:32:44	npa	do you get the thing where if you don't take it, you don't even feel tired?
2018-12-18 06:32:51	npa	i pull allnighters that way
2018-12-18 06:32:54	~ahriman	mushmouth: i get that, i don't like loud noises
2018-12-18 06:32:57	~ahriman	npa hell yes i do
2018-12-18 06:33:00	mushmouth	also i have sleeping problems so i need to take medication for it
2018-12-18 06:33:04	~ahriman	i literally don't get tired
2018-12-18 06:33:09	mushmouth	if i don't take it at all i stay up all day/night
2018-12-18 06:33:31	fosslinux	lol wtf
2018-12-18 06:33:34	fosslinux	you don't get tired
2018-12-18 06:33:36	fosslinux	at all
2018-12-18 06:33:43	mushmouth	takes a lot to get me tired man
2018-12-18 06:33:52	npa	yeah it's bizarre fosslinux
2018-12-18 06:33:58	fosslinux	thats very bizzare
2018-12-18 06:33:59	npa	i conk out eventually though
2018-12-18 06:34:02	fosslinux	oh crap
2018-12-18 06:34:07	npa	after like 40 hours or something
2018-12-18 06:34:09	fosslinux	does anyone know how to quit brow.sh
2018-12-18 06:34:18	~ben	aka headless firefox
2018-12-18 06:34:22	~ben	q?
2018-12-18 06:34:26	mushmouth	ctrl + c?
2018-12-18 06:34:29	npa	ctrl-\
2018-12-18 06:34:34	~ben	alt+f4
2018-12-18 06:34:39	fosslinux	ctrl+c dosen-t work
2018-12-18 06:34:44	fosslinux	its ctrl+q
2018-12-18 06:34:49	npa	~.
2018-12-18 06:34:51	mushmouth	i didn't get the whole idea of "headless firefox" in fact to be brutally honest it's fucking retarded
2018-12-18 06:35:05	npa	mushmouth - web testing..?
2018-12-18 06:35:08	mushmouth	i'd just use lynx or elinks
2018-12-18 06:35:19	mushmouth	npa: yeah but for tui/cli usage as a normal user?
2018-12-18 06:35:26	fosslinux	it looks way better compared to lynx or elinks
2018-12-18 06:35:27	npa	i agree on that one lol
2018-12-18 06:35:33	mushmouth	you have to install firefox then have brow.sh
2018-12-18 06:35:36	~ahriman	fosslinux: i just hit ctrl-w until all the tabs are dead
2018-12-18 06:35:39	mushmouth	so firefox still runs
2018-12-18 06:35:57	npa	idk, the renderer etc is one of the expensive parts
2018-12-18 06:36:14	npa	but evaluating it in the terminal would just be as expensive
2018-12-18 06:36:17	npa	so, who knows
2018-12-18 06:36:32	~ahriman	i <3 browsh
2018-12-18 06:36:51	mushmouth	i'd rather use w3m if im going that route
2018-12-18 06:37:18	npa	does browsh do javascript?
2018-12-18 06:37:27	~ahriman	trying out w3m now
2018-12-18 06:37:28	mushmouth	npa: it basically uses firefox like a daemon
2018-12-18 06:37:29	npa	i would think that's one of the benefits of using headless, right
2018-12-18 06:37:37	~ben	what about qutebrowser
2018-12-18 06:37:40	mushmouth	so you have to exec firefox
2018-12-18 06:37:43	mushmouth	then browsh
2018-12-18 06:37:48	fosslinux	no
2018-12-18 06:37:49	TildeBot	no u infinity fosslinux
2018-12-18 06:37:55	fosslinux	you can just run browsh google.com
2018-12-18 06:38:22	~ben	i need darkreader too much
2018-12-18 06:38:24	mushmouth	ben: qutebrowser not bad
2018-12-18 06:38:34	mushmouth	at least it make sense
2018-12-18 06:38:53	mushmouth	it to replace that other vim browser that dropped support
2018-12-18 06:38:54	~ben	i'd try to use it more if it had something like darkreader
2018-12-18 06:38:56	mushmouth	or deprecated
2018-12-18 06:39:18	npa	idk, justuse vimium
2018-12-18 06:39:23	npa	works in ff and chrome
2018-12-18 06:39:38	mushmouth	vimium only works kind of okay. last time i remember trying to touch it
2018-12-18 06:39:39	~ben	i just use ff normally
2018-12-18 06:39:43	mushmouth	but im not really a vim user so.
2018-12-18 06:40:03	~ahriman	i <3 vim but i just use firefox like a bro
2018-12-18 06:40:05	fosslinux	ahriman: how do i navigate in browsh
2018-12-18 06:40:11	~ahriman	ctrl-L
2018-12-18 06:40:13	npa	the only annoying thing about it is that certain filetypes don't allow vim navigation
2018-12-18 06:40:17	~ahriman	arrows
2018-12-18 06:40:19	~ahriman	enter
2018-12-18 06:40:19	npa	limitation of webextensions >:(
2018-12-18 06:40:28	~ben	ff is fine 4 me
2018-12-18 06:40:29	fosslinux	oh
2018-12-18 06:40:29	mushmouth	i can recommend another alt to vimium if it still being worked on
2018-12-18 06:40:30	fosslinux	kk
2018-12-18 06:41:05	mushmouth	vimfx is not a bad option
2018-12-18 06:41:28	~ahriman	browsh no gopher :/

2018-12-18 06:44:14	npa	i have no merit to stand on either
2018-12-18 06:44:22	mushmouth	i use dos and c64
2018-12-18 06:44:25	npa	and i use gnome-screenshot to take screenshots
2018-12-18 06:44:27	mushmouth	:P
2018-12-18 06:44:39	~ahriman	npa: *GASP*
2018-12-18 06:44:39	~ben	ff
2018-12-18 06:44:45	~ahriman	konsole on i3?!
2018-12-18 06:44:54	mushmouth	yeah use urxvt or xterm
2018-12-18 06:44:58	~ahriman	i mean it has its merits
2018-12-18 06:45:05	~ahriman	im just f'in with ya really
2018-12-18 06:45:07	mushmouth	there not hard to learn or customize
2018-12-18 06:45:09	~ben	i haven't really had a reason to switch from gnome
2018-12-18 06:45:34	~ahriman	im so accustomed to st so i just compile it on whatever os i use
2018-12-18 06:45:43	~ahriman	like from st.suckless.org
2018-12-18 06:45:43	mushmouth	st nice too
2018-12-18 06:45:46	~ben	st sucks
2018-12-18 06:45:50	~ahriman	:-O
2018-12-18 06:45:52	~ben	i wasn't impressed with it at all
2018-12-18 06:45:57	mushmouth	ben that because you can't learn c :D
2018-12-18 06:46:03	~ben	wow piss off
2018-12-18 06:46:07	 *	ahriman says meekly 'but i like it'
2018-12-18 06:46:10	mushmouth	sorry :P
2018-12-18 06:46:27	mushmouth	it's honestly not bad. but a lotof libs or binaries just clash with it
2018-12-18 06:46:31	~ben	it doesn't do links properly 
2018-12-18 06:46:37	~ben	and it doesn't have tabs
2018-12-18 06:46:39	mushmouth	you can diff that
2018-12-18 06:46:45	mushmouth	or make the patch yourself
2018-12-18 06:46:51	~ahriman	no fr tho, im used to it, and habitually run tmux anyway so i don't worry about history, i don't use tabs or links, just copy/paste
2018-12-18 06:46:51	TildeBot	no u infinity ahriman
2018-12-18 06:47:07	~ben	oof copy paste is like 3 more steps than just clicking it
2018-12-18 06:47:13	~ahriman	i know
2018-12-18 06:47:19	~ben	plus i don't really have any need to switch from gnome-terminal
2018-12-18 06:47:25	mushmouth	the whole purpose of a lot of suckless tools are they are minimal and meant to be sourced or compiled
2018-12-18 06:47:27	~ben	it's pretty great tbh
2018-12-18 06:47:40	~ben	right but i don't want to lose all the functionality that i'm used to
2018-12-18 06:47:54	~ahriman	yeah gnome term def has its uses, that and konsole are like the cadillac terminals
2018-12-18 06:47:56	npa	why are st links broken
2018-12-18 06:47:56	~ben	why trade functionality for a small source file
2018-12-18 06:48:02	mushmouth	i used to use like lxde terminal xfce and stuff. i just got tired of all that
2018-12-18 06:48:08	mushmouth	and rather source file all the stuff i need
2018-12-18 06:48:15	~ahriman	npa: st just doesnt do links
2018-12-18 06:48:24	mushmouth	ahriman: you can program or patch to make it
2018-12-18 06:48:32	mushmouth	but again that the suckless way
2018-12-18 06:48:41	~ben	but why bother doing that if i already have a terminal that works perfectly fine

2018-12-18 06:59:36	mushmouth	so clone hero is basically a rip off with new engine for guitar hero
2018-12-18 06:59:42	mushmouth	usually rock,metal some meme music charts
2018-12-18 06:59:57	mushmouth	osu mania, is typically like anime trance happy hardcore and meme
2018-12-18 07:00:05	~ben	that's a lot of buzzwords
2018-12-18 07:00:19	mushmouth	it's true

2018-12-18 07:03:05	~deepend	clone hero in my testing is a very poorly implimented copy of guitar hero.

2018-12-18 07:28:15	~ahriman	yeah fr
2018-12-18 07:28:38	~ahriman	i didn't have anything gnome installed and when testing unicode with gnome term it pulled gnu parted
2018-12-18 07:28:43	+jan6	that's a fun skit, btw, and yes, I would say about 80% of tumblr IS nsfw
2018-12-18 07:29:00	+jan6	lolwut?
2018-12-18 07:29:37	+jan6	it doesn't directly depend on it
2018-12-18 07:30:19	+jan6	so idk what dependency depends on it
2018-12-18 07:31:53	mushmouth	jan6: yeah it doesn't make sense
2018-12-18 07:32:33	+jan6	neither does tumblr
2018-12-18 07:37:42	+jan6	are you SURE the parted is a dependency of the terminal? if so I guess you can ask the maintainers of it to not require it?
2018-12-18 07:38:09	~ahriman	i think it pulled a metapackage of gnome shit
2018-12-18 07:38:18	+jan6	it shouldn't, tho
2018-12-18 07:38:29	+jan6	always monitor your apt, lol
2018-12-18 07:38:46	~ahriman	i did
2018-12-18 07:38:54	+jan6	also grep "parted" /var/log/apt/term.log
2018-12-18 07:38:59	~ahriman	i still wanted to use gnome term for like 3 minutes
2018-12-18 07:39:03	~ahriman	ok will do
2018-12-18 07:39:24	+jan6	is there a mention in there? cause it seems to be the log of what's printed out to you
2018-12-18 07:40:03	~ahriman	no additional info
2018-12-18 07:40:04	TildeBot	no u infinity ahriman
2018-12-18 07:40:11	~ahriman	or nothing useful i mean
2018-12-18 07:40:14	+jan6	/var/log/apt/history.log contains the "package description" part, so could try that too I guess
2018-12-18 07:40:25	+jan6	if nothing useful, then what DID you geT?
2018-12-18 07:41:08	~ahriman	just 'unpacking libparted, unpacking parted" etc
2018-12-18 07:42:30	+jan6	well, you have your hit then, lol
2018-12-18 07:42:57	~ahriman	but why tf would a term need libparted
2018-12-18 07:43:04	+jan6	grep -B20 or something, I guess, ot print 20 previous lines, so you might see what pulled them in
2018-12-18 07:43:15	~ahriman	eh not too worried, it's off my system now
2018-12-18 07:43:30	+jan6	would be good to know what wants it tho
2018-12-18 07:44:09	~ahriman	ughhhhhhhh fineeee
2018-12-18 07:46:21	~ahriman	im guessing fuse pulled it, though im not super familiar with apt's logging syntax: https://bin.tilde.team/15l4

2018-12-18 16:07:45	%ubergeek	GDPR is "that bad"
2018-12-18 16:08:03	%ubergeek	I had to block a non-profit I run from being access from the EU, dur to it.
2018-12-18 16:08:09	%ubergeek	s/dur/due/
2018-12-18 16:08:09	sedbot	<ubergeek> I had to block a non-profit I run from being access from the EU, due to it.
2018-12-18 16:08:35	erxeto	ubergeek: why is that ?
2018-12-18 16:09:24	%ubergeek	Because my non profit doesn't have the funds to hire a lawyer in each EU nation, to ensure we comply with their particular flavor of interpretation.  And we cannot afford to hire another EU person to play "Data Guardian"
2018-12-18 16:09:24	+jan6	hmm, I wonder if "here's our vpn if you're not using one already, we don't keep logs so we have no idea where you're coming from therefore free from legal obligations"
2018-12-18 16:09:46	%ubergeek	Basically, as it boils down, the GDPR is a way to ensure no small players can possibly shoot up.
2018-12-18 16:10:09	+jan6	afaik it's mostly just "you have a right to know exactly what's done with your data, and revoke access to any of it" tho?
2018-12-18 16:10:21	%ubergeek	Social media posts are considered "PIA", which means I had to block that non-profit's Mastodon instance from communicating with any EU server
2018-12-18 16:10:38	%ubergeek	Because by storing their posts (WHich is how the fediverse works), we had to meet all of those requirements.
2018-12-18 16:11:07	%ubergeek	We also couldn't afford for a consultant to come in for 2 years, and ensure everything is compliant.
2018-12-18 16:11:26	+jan6	and for a daily dose of cheer:
2018-12-18 16:11:27	+jan6	11:07 <@idlerpg_bot> ahriman found kitten! This wondrous godsend has accelerated them 0 days, 02:21:01 towards level 39.
2018-12-18 16:11:42	%ubergeek	And, a 10 million dollar fine would put our organization at risk, so the choice was made to instead protect our mission, and just block the EU
2018-12-18 16:12:53	+aewens	Gotta love the mess the EU has made of the Internet
2018-12-18 16:14:34	%ubergeek	All that, even though we do not maintain any logs outside of 24 hours (For technical troubleshooting), and aside from the social media posts (And email addrs, and such), we don't keep any PIA
2018-12-18 16:15:05	%ubergeek	But, would still need to hire all of those lawyers, just to protect the mission.  Which, in the end, wouldn't protect our served public.  It's just wasted overhead.
2018-12-18 16:15:57	%ubergeek	Another NPO board member I spoke with in the US told me they're just going to risk it, but we wanted to avoid the nuisance law suits, from nuisance "Data Requests" and such
2018-12-18 16:18:27	severak	It's possible to serve content for EU customers without datamining them.
2018-12-18 16:20:37	+aewens	I thought the issue with implementations wasn't data mining, but the nuance about what classifies as "storing user data".

2018-12-18 16:22:28	+jan6	kinda both imo
2018-12-18 16:22:47	+jan6	it was meant to put the customer in control of their own data
2018-12-18 16:23:12	+jan6	but yeah, WHAT data and to which extent?

2018-12-18 16:24:36	+aewens	Yeah, that second part is the kicker. I'm all for customers controlling their data, but having to sort through legalese to determine if you'll be fined into bankrupcy from the europeans over a web app is another thing

2018-12-18 16:29:29	erxeto	that happened here long time ago with the LOPD (the spanish law I was talking about)
2018-12-18 16:29:50	erxeto	a big fuzz, people going crazy ... 
2018-12-18 16:30:17	+aewens	I'm saying that by the sheer fact that none of us read it but of the implications of ignoring it implies is part of the issue.
2018-12-18 16:30:33	 *	jan6 casually attempting to read raw arrow keys in bash, and failing, pretty sure the "case" statement doesn't deal with escape sequences :(
2018-12-18 16:33:15	+aewens	For instance, if they made GDPR compliancy just be "if the data was provided or derived by input or actions of the user, it must be requestable and deletable by the user" that would be easy enough to understand and we could all walk away happy about that.
2018-12-18 16:33:28	+jan6	...
2018-12-18 16:33:33	robdrake	o/
2018-12-18 16:33:36	+jan6	why ISN'T it that, tbh?
2018-12-18 16:33:44	+aewens	Because that would be too easy
2018-12-18 16:33:47	+jan6	lol
2018-12-18 16:33:51	%ubergeek	severak: my org isn't data mining, and is in fact, trying to NOT data mine.  But, we cannot afford the lawyers needed to prove compliance.
2018-12-18 16:34:14	+aewens	^ And this is the heart of the issue
2018-12-18 16:34:18	+jan6	give them a suggestion of using that wording, lol, I bet most of them didn't even think simplicity as a possibility
2018-12-18 16:34:42	%ubergeek	As far as EU masto instance not closing en masse, well, either they have a lot of money, or are taking on a lot of risk
2018-12-18 16:34:59	+jan6	risk is the name of the game nowdays, heh
2018-12-18 16:35:06	+aewens	I'm sure there's some legalese nuance from my wording that can somehow allow some corporate lawyer to skirt the law and do all kinds of evil non-sense.
2018-12-18 16:35:14	%ubergeek	Yeah, $10 million is a YUUGE risk
2018-12-18 16:35:38	+aewens	"Well technically because of it's wording we didn't necessarily..."
2018-12-18 16:35:41	+jan6	the trick is to never tie it to yourself, and then just go and hide when the charges come ;P

2018-12-18 16:38:04	+aewens	Or Mr Server-Master, that works too xD
2018-12-18 16:40:17	+jan6	better yet, just plain old "anonymous" xD
2018-12-18 16:41:24	+jan6	if there are 10 people named anonymous, running different stuff, it gets a bit hard to keep track of "anonymous nr 17, xxx.tilde, typing style 7b" and stuff
2018-12-18 16:42:47	+jan6	back in bash-land, I'm dissapointed I have to rely on $(echo -e) stuff to get stuff working...smh
2018-12-18 16:44:26	+aewens	You could also use a nicer scripting language
2018-12-18 16:46:08	+jan6	like? there's no nicer language that shell scripting ;P
2018-12-18 16:46:44	+jan6	I mean, you'd have to download lua or python or whatever in order to run, and features might get deprecated and stuff, bash is pretty much constant forever
2018-12-18 16:46:46	robdrake	zsh scripting?
2018-12-18 16:47:09	+jan6	zsh isn't ok for the same reason I don't use lua right now

2018-12-18 16:51:39	+aewens	jan6: Are you doing something that utilizes a language feature that would have any likelihood of being deprecated in future releases?
2018-12-18 16:52:15	+aewens	Because it's fairly easy to write Python code that will work in either v2 or v3 without issue.

2018-12-18 18:16:26	~ben	oh lol
2018-12-18 18:16:37	~ben	actually the main use for my swiss army knife is bottle opener
2018-12-18 18:16:39	%ubergeek	heyo mushmouth 
2018-12-18 18:16:49	mushmouth	oh uh ben ubergeek has a really funny story of a ban he listened to i don't know if you caught itin #yourtilde

2018-12-18 18:17:12	~ben	which band?
2018-12-18 18:17:20	+aewens	The most use my swiss knife tends to get is my wife using the scissors to try and trim her hair while I'm driving.
2018-12-18 18:17:29	mushmouth	im waiting for ubergeek  to explain it if he can
2018-12-18 18:17:30	~ben	lmao

2018-12-18 20:56:16	mushmouth	the emacs dotfiles
2018-12-18 20:57:20	mushmouth	but this one is asking for weird config
2018-12-18 20:57:24	mushmouth	i'll test it on local machine
2018-12-18 20:59:37	+jan6	whoo wee, I made a decimal to binary converter!
2018-12-18 20:59:48	+jan6	it's busybox & ash compatible!!!!
2018-12-18 21:01:01	+jan6	I just tested, mkdir -p /tmp/xxx/bin;cp /bin/busybox /tmp/xxx/bin;chroot /tmp/xxx busybox ash; paste script, boom!
2018-12-18 21:01:17	+jan6	also I can now easily convert it to unicode
2018-12-18 21:01:44	+jan6	guess the number: ▄▀▀▄▀▄▄▀▄▄
2018-12-18 21:02:07	~ahriman	1001011011?
2018-12-18 21:02:15	+jan6	no, decimal
2018-12-18 21:02:18	~ahriman	oh
2018-12-18 21:02:25	~ahriman	eleventy six
2018-12-18 21:02:39	+jan6	it was supposeds to be 420, lol
2018-12-18 21:02:47	~ahriman	i ALMOST said 420
2018-12-18 21:02:51	~ahriman	just as a joke
2018-12-18 21:02:58	+jan6	all I did was sed -e "s/0/▄/g" -e "s/1/▀/g"

2018-12-18 21:04:45	+jan6	cause you totally could use unicode quadrants instead of halfblocks, either the same way as I did (up-down instead of on-off) but 2x more compact, ooor as 2 completely separate on-off lines
2018-12-18 21:04:50	+jan6	hai again morse
2018-12-18 21:05:45	+jan6	also it's basically the first thing I did NOT copy-paste off the internet for the msot part, lol

2018-12-18 21:09:17	~ahriman	mushmouth there's also pgrep
2018-12-18 21:09:21	mushmouth	i only use htop if i need realtime
2018-12-18 21:09:23	~ahriman	combines it into one
2018-12-18 21:09:23	+jan6	hm
2018-12-18 21:09:32	+jan6	did you mean ps -ax grep?
2018-12-18 21:09:32	~ahriman	pgrep 'processname'
2018-12-18 21:09:40	+jan6	or did you forget a pipe?

2018-12-18 22:14:01	%ubergeek	Which pubnix is the oldest?  Grex?
2018-12-18 22:14:12	%ubergeek	(Oldest living)
2018-12-18 22:16:06	+aewens	Well, it would probably help if there was a good shared name for these types of server.
2018-12-18 22:16:26	+aewens	There's "shared servers", "public server", "pubnix", "tilde", etc
2018-12-18 22:17:11	%ubergeek	I guess as far as I'm thinking is a public server, running *Nix...
2018-12-18 22:17:35	%ubergeek	... where people generally interact with command-line based utilities, rather than something like Discord
2018-12-18 22:18:04	%ubergeek	But, I see you point.  Is Dreamhost, and it's forums a pubnix?
2018-12-18 22:20:03	+aewens	I think it might be sdf? Grex game out in 1993ish and sdf came around in 1987ish and is still standing
2018-12-18 22:21:19	+aewens	Also, this image of the sdf servers is neat https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/SDF_Heart.jpg

2018-12-18 22:25:08	%ubergeek	It'd be unique, at least lol
2018-12-18 22:25:50	%ubergeek	are there any other older pubnixes besides grex and sdf?
2018-12-18 22:25:57	%ubergeek	those are the only ones that come to mind
2018-12-18 22:26:50	%ubergeek	or, and Nyx
2018-12-18 22:29:18	+aewens	I'm sure there were older ones, but I think they are the oldest that are still around.
2018-12-18 22:30:22	+aewens	As for the solar powered pi, wouldn't that mean that for a good portion of the day it would be offline due to the lack of power?
2018-12-18 22:31:08	+aewens	Also, I imagine it'd be fairly slow once a few users are online running things.

2018-12-18 22:40:58	+jan6	I think there's a reason why there aren't much of them ;P
2018-12-18 22:41:20	%ubergeek	aewens: I have 40w/h of batteries sitting around :)
2018-12-18 22:41:31	+jan6	you need to be in a quite sunny area + a big enough power bank for night and clouds
2018-12-18 22:41:32	%ubergeek	or, 140W/hrs
2018-12-18 22:42:05	+aewens	ubergeek: So the solar power is charging the batteries?
2018-12-18 22:42:07	%ubergeek	Pis sip power.  I ran a BBS on this setup for a while, which is the main reason I'm even considering it
2018-12-18 22:42:21	+jan6	don't have a too big one charging all at once tho, no poing in charging a massive battery to 3% ;P
2018-12-18 22:42:23	%ubergeek	Yes, through a charge controller, and the Pi runs off a 5V adapter
2018-12-18 22:43:16	+aewens	Alright, that sounds fair. As long as the calculus leads to the battery being charged as much or more than the pi is using that should be fine.
2018-12-18 22:43:31	+jan6	I'd say a combo would be best
2018-12-18 22:44:16	+jan6	if sun == enough, power-relay_switch(sunpower) else power-relay_switch(externalpower)
2018-12-18 22:44:53	%ubergeek	I think it fell off during an inordinatley long cloudy spell we had, and then also (At first) before I installed a fan in the box to vent heat away during a 95 degree spell lol
2018-12-18 22:45:10	+jan6	exactly, so it's not offline, but if sun exists, it works
2018-12-18 22:45:40	+jan6	if sun doesn't exist, it also works tho, with my verison
2018-12-18 22:46:31	%ubergeek	oh god, the WELL....  I forgot about that system.  Always wanted an account, never got a Round Tuit, though
2018-12-18 22:46:45	+jan6	?
2018-12-18 22:47:06	%ubergeek	Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link.  An early, very elite, BBS
2018-12-18 22:47:16	+aewens	Oh, fun idea. You can measure the amount of power the Pi will pull on an average day, how much sunlight is needed to charge the battery that amount, and then attach a light sensor with a microcontroller to bridge a wall connection to the battery whenever it detects that the battery will dip too low to power the pi.
2018-12-18 22:47:27	%ubergeek	Researching pubnix history as we chat
2018-12-18 22:48:09	+aewens	So it can then be running on wall outlet power for the period of time it's super cloudy and then go back to battery power when the battery is ready without any human intervention.
2018-12-18 22:48:16	+jan6	æwens taking my idea into reality, nice
2018-12-18 22:48:30	+jan6	exactly what I was saying ;P
2018-12-18 22:48:38	%ubergeek	mains cutover is tricky...
2018-12-18 22:48:42	+jan6	great minds think alike? ;P

2018-12-18 22:53:45	+jan6	I forgot how massive it's links are, lol
2018-12-18 22:53:49	%ubergeek	jan6 is bout to get kicked by tildebot lol
2018-12-18 22:53:50	TildeBot	ubergeek, Will kill midlow, as master jan6 commands you to follow the 9999 commandments of jan6 are catching on quickly, master jan6 approves of.
2018-12-18 22:54:01	%ubergeek	damn.  harsh
2018-12-18 22:54:06	+jan6	nah, tildebot is chill with master jan6 ;P
2018-12-18 22:54:07	TildeBot	jan6, , Jan6 is the village idiot tildebot, all hail master jan6 orders to stop my transmission feel free to.
2018-12-18 22:54:13	+jan6	eeeh, sure
2018-12-18 22:55:46	+aewens	Well, once you reach IPv32 it no longer makes sense to host any real web code. Just by the address that represents it's binary form.
2018-12-18 22:56:49	+jan6	so, is ipv16 overkill for content hashing, or just enough?=
2018-12-18 22:56:49	%ubergeek	dem routing tables tho
2018-12-18 22:57:08	+jan6	tables? it's all handled by an AI, boiiii
2018-12-18 23:00:27	+aewens	Since I already have all the equations, IPv512 would come out in the year 10634 and take up 3e153 bytes of data.
2018-12-18 23:01:38	+aewens	Or 1e36 gigabytes of data
2018-12-18 23:01:54	+jan6	lol
2018-12-18 23:02:30	+jan6	would ipv1024 happen before the heat death of the universe?
2018-12-18 23:02:48	+aewens	Or 1e24 yotabytes of data
2018-12-18 23:03:01	+jan6	daaam that's a ton
2018-12-18 23:03:18	+aewens	The largest existing modern storage server could not store 1 IPv512 IP address
2018-12-18 23:04:07	+aewens	And IPv1024 would be released in 19311, so the universe will still be kickin' then
2018-12-18 23:04:21	+jan6	ipv1024 would need WAY MORE data to actually POINT to something, than the actual data itself, lol...unless we start using entire universes as data storage, lol
2018-12-18 23:05:40	+jan6	instead of usb drives it'll be just pocket dimensions where data is stored in molecules or stuff
2018-12-18 23:06:45	+aewens	For IPv1024, it would be 2^992 gigabytes
2018-12-18 23:07:12	+aewens	For comparison, IPv512 would be 2^480 gigabytes
2018-12-18 23:07:49	+aewens	I needed to use a symbolic calculator for that bit since a normal one freaked out when I told it to do 2^1025
2018-12-18 23:09:13	+aewens	And for completeness, IPv512 is 2^450 yotabytes and IPv1024 is 2^962 yotabytes
2018-12-18 23:14:29	+jan6	if only I had the ability to not require constant sleep
2018-12-18 23:14:50	+aewens	I know what you mean, it's annoying.
2018-12-18 23:15:01	+aewens	And it just keeps coming up every, single, day
2018-12-18 23:15:02	+jan6	"I needed to use a symbolic calculator for that bit since a normal one freaked out" lol, I love when that happens
2018-12-18 23:15:27	+jan6	I feel fine now, but I really rather not be a zombie tomorrow...ugh
2018-12-18 23:16:13	+jan6	and y'know, I don't do energy drinks or coffee or any drugs of that sort either, so ehhhhh

2018-12-18 23:16:20	+jan6	there
2018-12-18 23:17:00	+aewens	I only drink coffee during emergencies. I found drinking it every day made it hard to feel awake without it even with 8 hours of sleep.
2018-12-18 23:17:01	+jan6	I'll go now I guess, only what, 5:45 to sleep instead of the 8 hours I'm used to? no biggie...eghh at least vacation is close
2018-12-18 23:17:58	+jan6	then I can sleep till 1pm and go to bed at 2am ;P (13 and 2 respectively, for normal people)
2018-12-18 23:21:46	+aewens	My "vacation" includes driving across the state trying to visit all of the family.
2018-12-18 23:21:55	+aewens	Live was easier not being an "adult".
2018-12-18 23:22:03	+jan6	lucky me ;P

2018-12-18 23:25:58	+aewens	Quick thing for IPv512, by that point there is no longer enough atoms in the known universe to even store the IP address.
2018-12-18 23:28:48	+aewens	And the point at which we run out of atoms for IP addresses is IPv276 during the year 6622.
2018-12-18 23:29:58	+aewens	Wait, forgot the +1 bit. It'd be IPv275 during the year 6605
2018-12-18 23:30:23	+aewens	Except I guess it would still be IPv276 since it goes in increments of 2 every 34 years.
2018-12-18 23:31:24	+aewens	Anyways, IPv276 would have 2e83 IP addresses, placing it over the theorized 1e83 atoms in the known universe.

2018-12-19 02:18:31	robdrake	I know
2018-12-19 02:18:52	robdrake	but still, mice would be prey whether wild or domestic for my cats

2018-12-19 04:54:17	~ben	idk whatever got installed with the default gnome install
2018-12-19 04:54:29	~ben	never bothered to use anything besides what i'm used to i guess
2018-12-19 04:54:31	~ahriman	oh ok, it's gdm, i didn't know if you replaced it with an alt
2018-12-19 04:54:44	~ahriman	nothing wrong with that
2018-12-19 04:54:58	~ben	it's perfectly fine for everything i do
2018-12-19 04:55:23	~ahriman	like tbh if you like gnome and you're accustomed to it i wouldn't really recommend switching to something as radically different as i3 because you probably won't like it
2018-12-19 04:55:31	~ben	lol
2018-12-19 04:55:40	~ben	someone tried to get me to try xmonad
2018-12-19 04:55:45	~ahriman	oh god
2018-12-19 04:55:45	~ben	and that was rough
2018-12-19 04:56:00	~ben	that was like 6 months ago
2018-12-19 04:56:08	~ben	i'm going to get a central tilde.chat node set up
2018-12-19 04:56:09	~ahriman	jfc, i apologize for my tiling wm brethren's behavior
2018-12-19 04:56:20	~ben	lol
2018-12-19 04:56:43	~ahriman	do you think hubzilla will take off on the tildeverse? because i'm down to set up an instance
2018-12-19 04:56:45	npa	what's wrong with xmonad?
2018-12-19 04:56:52	~ahriman	it's a PITA
2018-12-19 04:56:59	mushmouth	i feel like if i wanted to ben i could do xmonad
2018-12-19 04:57:03	mushmouth	if i put the effort in
2018-12-19 04:57:09	npa	i'm surprised you don't use dwm ahriman
2018-12-19 04:57:10	~ahriman	especially for someone who is accustomed to gnome not tiling WMs
2018-12-19 04:57:12	~ben	i could to
2018-12-19 04:57:16	~ben	s/$/o
2018-12-19 04:57:17	sedbot	<ben> i could too
2018-12-19 04:57:19	~ben	but why 
2018-12-19 04:57:21	~ahriman	npa: i used to but got annoyed with it
2018-12-19 04:57:25	npa	internet cred ben
2018-12-19 04:57:33	~ben	ehh not worth it
2018-12-19 04:57:38	npa	if you want real cred, use sway
2018-12-19 04:57:45	~ben	"just cause i can" isn't worth it for me
2018-12-19 04:57:48	~ahriman	sway is purdy
2018-12-19 04:57:51	~ben	i want something that Works
2018-12-19 04:58:00	~ben	oh sway is by the same guy as sr.ht
2018-12-19 04:58:29	~ben	that should probably be what i'd use
2018-12-19 04:58:35	~ben	buster is wayland by default
2018-12-19 04:58:48	~ahriman	oh fr
2018-12-19 04:58:56	~ahriman	shit
2018-12-19 04:59:01	~ahriman	i need to try sway then
2018-12-19 04:59:16	~ben	yeah!
2018-12-19 04:59:19	~ben	do it
2018-12-19 04:59:39	~ahriman	ben: what do you think about what i said about hubzilla?
2018-12-19 04:59:51	~ben	tbh i have no idea if it will garner any use
2018-12-19 04:59:58	~ahriman	that's what im worried about
2018-12-19 05:00:05	~ben	yeah....
2018-12-19 05:00:08	~ahriman	crap
2018-12-19 05:00:18	~ben	i mean if it's something you can run with existing resources 
2018-12-19 05:00:27	~ben	then ofc go for it
2018-12-19 05:00:40	~ben	but i mean we already have a bunch of tilde ways to get in touch
2018-12-19 05:00:41	npa	oh really ben?
2018-12-19 05:00:44	npa	wayland, sick
2018-12-19 05:01:03	~ahriman	yeah im probably gonna kill off thebsd.club because it's not taking off, i figure i can either use the vps for something tilde related or let it lapse on the 25th
2018-12-19 05:01:17	~ben	gah i really wanted that to take off
2018-12-19 05:01:22	~ahriman	me too
2018-12-19 05:01:35	~ben	i didn't have anything to post though
2018-12-19 05:01:37	~ben	:s
2018-12-19 05:01:39	~ahriman	i mean it is only $5/month
2018-12-19 05:02:02	~ahriman	i could keep it up for another month or two and see how it goes because i did put a lot of work into the starter content / guides
2018-12-19 05:02:23	~ben	at least save/archive the content somewhere
2018-12-19 05:02:27	~ben	obviously
2018-12-19 05:02:28	<--	mhj (mhj@yourtilde.com) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)
2018-12-19 05:02:30	~ahriman	yeah definitely
2018-12-19 05:02:40	~ben	it doesn't necessarily have to be on its own vps
2018-12-19 05:02:48	~ben	but that's super valuable stuff
2018-12-19 05:03:29	~ahriman	i'm gonna think about it because i have until the 25th to pay. if i kill it off i'll save the guides, and if i leave it i'll just hope for the best over the next month or two
2018-12-19 05:03:57	~ben	yeah give it some thought
2018-12-19 05:04:07	~ben	you can always just update the dns to point to a different box
2018-12-19 05:04:16	~ben	even point it at the ~inst wiki
2018-12-19 05:07:08	~ahriman	yeah true
2018-12-19 05:07:15	~ahriman	add the content there
2018-12-19 05:07:22	~ben	wouldn't be too bad to merge those two places
2018-12-19 05:07:26	~ahriman	ill decide before the 25th
2018-12-19 05:07:31	~ben	yeah
2018-12-19 05:07:41	~ben	fair enough
2018-12-19 05:08:31	mushmouth	would you mind if i toke it over ahriman ?
2018-12-19 05:08:47	~ben	you want to host $5/month?
2018-12-19 05:09:20	mushmouth	tempted
2018-12-19 05:09:33	mushmouth	when i get a raise in my payments to 50 ish
2018-12-19 05:09:45	mushmouth	in the new year i'll get 400 and maybe i can host it
2018-12-19 05:10:24	~ahriman	that's another idea, i'll definitely consider that too
2018-12-19 05:10:46	~ben	yeah i mean if you're up for it
2018-12-19 05:11:46	mushmouth	i wouldn't mind hosting a bsd tilde if you accept the offer ahriman 
2018-12-19 05:12:10	~ben	it's not a tilde
2018-12-19 05:12:12	~ben	it's a forum
2018-12-19 05:12:18	mushmouth	oh

2018-12-19 06:19:27	npa	how about we have a tilde for creating tildes
2018-12-19 06:19:29	mushmouth	if you don't mind telling me the distro of the bsd?
2018-12-19 06:19:40	mushmouth	or in pm's
2018-12-19 06:19:42	npa	the only activity is spinning up containers and setting up irc bridges
2018-12-19 06:19:44	~ben	cause we already have two bsd tildes
2018-12-19 06:20:03	mushmouth	free and open right?

2018-12-19 06:20:39	mushmouth	if we had all different bsd distro types
2018-12-19 06:20:41	mushmouth	it would be neat
2018-12-19 06:21:24	~ben	you're welcome to
2018-12-19 06:21:39	~ben	one bsd tilde is enough admin work for me
2018-12-19 06:21:45	mushmouth	i don't mind
2018-12-19 06:21:50	mushmouth	i research enough in the hacking world
2018-12-19 06:22:24	~ben	what are you hacking?
2018-12-19 06:22:30	~ben	bsd stuff should be in the manpages
2018-12-19 06:22:48	mushmouth	im not specifically hacking but i have friends who do it for me. and they do reverse shells in like freebsd for example
2018-12-19 06:23:01	mushmouth	and tell me stuff
2018-12-19 06:23:02	~ben	i thought you were going to set up a tilde?
2018-12-19 06:23:16	mushmouth	oh i want to. but i was explaing the "hacking" thing
2018-12-19 06:24:46	mushmouth	i stopped like even trying to get into the scene a long time ago
2018-12-19 06:24:50	mushmouth	most of my knowledge is dated
2018-12-19 06:25:13	<--	ben|inst (ben@tilde.institute) has quit (quit: WeeChat 2.2)
2018-12-19 06:25:23	<--	ben|yt (ben@0::1) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.3)

2018-12-19 06:26:33	mushmouth	im sure i could still learn if i wanted too but i don't like hacking due to people who don't know enough about technology doesn't help them
2018-12-19 06:26:54	mushmouth	im constantly having to explain to people what x technology is
2018-12-19 06:27:15	npa	yeah that's a problem with that kinda stuff
2018-12-19 06:27:22	npa	if you're into security, read /r/netsec
2018-12-19 06:27:27	npa	pretty damn good resource
2018-12-19 06:28:35	mushmouth	and since people often times get me confused with a hacker since i get most if not all the technology
2018-12-19 06:28:37	mushmouth	ugh
2018-12-19 06:29:34	mushmouth	ben have you heard of edgebsd before?
2018-12-19 06:29:50	mushmouth	https://www.edgebsd.org/
2018-12-19 06:29:52	TildeBot	The EdgeBSD Project: About EdgeBSD https://bhh.sh/2m9
2018-12-19 06:30:44	~ben	no
2018-12-19 06:30:45	TildeBot	no u infinity ben
2018-12-19 06:30:50	mushmouth	it's really neat
2018-12-19 06:31:51	~ben	what's the advantage over any of the other BSDs or linuxes
2018-12-19 06:32:05	mushmouth	they always typically have different kernel types
2018-12-19 06:32:15	mushmouth	so in linux you only have the linux kernel type
2018-12-19 06:32:21	mushmouth	if you look at all the bsd distro kernel types
2018-12-19 06:32:23	mushmouth	all different
2018-12-19 06:32:35	~ben	i'm aware
2018-12-19 06:32:38	~ben	what's the difference
2018-12-19 06:32:44	~ben	why use that over free or open bsd
2018-12-19 06:32:56	mushmouth	that. how they do their packages is different
2018-12-19 06:33:00	mushmouth	netbsd came up with pkgsrc
2018-12-19 06:33:14	mushmouth	some are more specific like free is more intel based
2018-12-19 06:33:19	mushmouth	open is more security focused
2018-12-19 06:33:24	mushmouth	net is more portablility

2018-12-19 08:31:42	robdrake	rust is just so wierd
2018-12-19 08:32:51	erxeto	I have to admit I've never seen a sigle line of that code.

2018-12-19 14:28:09	+jan6	every physical keyboard has travel, lol
2018-12-19 14:28:20	mushmouth	i mean something which sounds
2018-12-19 14:28:26	mushmouth	like membrain doesn't really
2018-12-19 14:28:50	+jan6	....sound doesn't matter
2018-12-19 14:29:32	mushmouth	to me it does
2018-12-19 14:29:35	+jan6	you can just play a keyboard sound on each keystroke on your computer
2018-12-19 14:31:35	mushmouth	well in that case you can type on a crappy chiclet keyboard
2018-12-19 14:31:40	mushmouth	and count that as mechanical
2018-12-19 14:31:47	+jan6	sure
2018-12-19 14:31:48	mushmouth	because you can program each keystroke
2018-12-19 14:32:09	+jan6	tbh I think the "mechanical" is anything with a spring mechanism, no matter how exactly
2018-12-19 14:32:39	mushmouth	i find the speeds also change depending on keyboard and switches
2018-12-19 14:32:50	mushmouth	like im slower on a membrain or chiclet style keyboard
2018-12-19 14:33:01	mushmouth	on a buckspring or mx like blue and stuff im faster
2018-12-19 14:33:14	+jan6	why?
2018-12-19 14:33:22	mushmouth	because better springs
2018-12-19 14:33:24	mushmouth	on the later
2018-12-19 14:33:49	+jan6	psychological
2018-12-19 14:34:52	+jan6	but sure, lots of people dp

2018-12-19 14:35:37	mushmouth	with no lettering if i remember correctly
2018-12-19 14:39:57	mushmouth	but i just stick to bucksprings or model m keybords

2018-12-19 15:57:05	+aewens	So now when I want to contribute my knowledge of math to a problem, I will shout "And my axes!"
2018-12-19 15:57:51	+jan6	^good idea ;P
2018-12-19 15:59:29	+aewens	On a similar note, once it warms up outside I'm considering building an axe throwing cage in my backyard.

2018-12-19 19:23:21	+aewens	I think he meant "intepret"
2018-12-19 19:23:27	mushmouth	in fact often times i think i'm wrong

2018-12-19 19:23:45	ubergeek	Just like in about 8 minutes, I'll be leaving, going to do IRL things, and then return in about an hour, and maybe reply to some stuff
2018-12-19 19:23:57	+jan6	are you sure we're not the same person, aewens? ;P
2018-12-19 19:24:04	mushmouth	maybe it's you who shouldn't be in the politics channel
2018-12-19 19:24:08	mushmouth	if you have no fucking time for it
2018-12-19 19:24:13	+aewens	jan6: Very certain xD
2018-12-19 19:24:27	ubergeek	That being said, may I remind everyone of the rules here: https://tilde.wiki/?page=code-of-conduct

2018-12-19 19:24:30	mushmouth	real political converstation take hours if not more
2018-12-19 19:24:39	mushmouth	if you don't have the time
2018-12-19 19:24:42	mushmouth	go to reddit or somewhere else
2018-12-19 19:24:46	+jan6	...
2018-12-19 19:24:56	+jan6	you don't have to have a "hot" conversation
2018-12-19 19:25:06	mushmouth	jan6: he likes doing this tatic
2018-12-19 19:25:09	+jan6	in fact, it's better if you have time between responses
2018-12-19 19:25:21	mushmouth	"ohhh whoa mee im way too busy"
2018-12-19 19:25:43	ubergeek	mushmouth: how interesting you are the sole determinor of how to use IRC...  It didn't seem to be the way things were done in 1998.  Maybe I'm dragging my old fogey ettiquette with me from there...
2018-12-19 19:25:57	mushmouth	i was born in 95
2018-12-19 19:26:07	mushmouth	i started irc when i played runescape around 2004
2018-12-19 19:26:14	mushmouth	people weren't this pathetic when i was browsing irc
2018-12-19 19:26:15	+jan6	14:25:21      mushmouth | "ohhh whoa mee im way too busy"
2018-12-19 19:26:19	+jan6	it ahppens to me too
2018-12-19 19:26:22	ubergeek	One rue commonly quoted:
2018-12-19 19:26:25	ubergeek	"Be patient. If there is no activity, it usually means that no one has read what you wrote yet. If no one responds, they don't know or didn't notice. You can re-try after a while, or ask if anyone has any clue with regards to your question x minutes ago. "
2018-12-19 19:26:38	+jan6	being busy at a convenient time CAN be a totally valid excuse
2018-12-19 19:26:44	mushmouth	ubergeek: so you want me to paste a sentence or paragraph constantly
2018-12-19 19:26:49	+jan6	yes
2018-12-19 19:26:50	mushmouth	until you read it
2018-12-19 19:26:53	ubergeek	I actually don't care what you do.
2018-12-19 19:26:54	mushmouth	okay i got you now
2018-12-19 19:27:13	+aewens	While we're quoting things, in section 3 there's also "exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions."
2018-12-19 19:27:20	+jan6	if you want someone to see something, just mention them on the same line as the message, simple"
2018-12-19 19:27:23	ubergeek	Everyone is free to use IRC as they see fit.  Reply a couple of hours later in a quiet channel is usually not a problem, ime

2018-12-19 19:27:34	mushmouth	aewens: which they oddly left out in rant/venting of me getting mad
2018-12-19 19:28:03	mushmouth	ubergeek: failed that rule
2018-12-19 19:28:44	ubergeek	my bad.  That infraction definitley warranted homophobic slurs being slung at people in #meta
2018-12-19 19:28:49	+jan6	I'd say you did too, ranting right now, so you're even on that ground ;P
2018-12-19 19:29:09	mushmouth	jan6: im not rejecting
2018-12-19 19:29:16	mushmouth	ubergeek: what homophobic? i only said pussy
2018-12-19 19:29:29	ubergeek	I shall echo 10 "Hail Mary's" into /dev/null, and clean my maildir of all old mail as penance.
2018-12-19 19:29:34	+jan6	how dare you not include all possible sexual organs at once!
2018-12-19 19:29:59	mushmouth	do i have to say the f word too?
2018-12-19 19:30:03	mushmouth	like what
2018-12-19 19:30:08	ubergeek	mushmouth: perhaps you didn't read what you wrote.  I suggest you chill, review your own words, then ask yourself if it was appropriate.
2018-12-19 19:30:19	mushmouth	i suggest you to do the same
2018-12-19 19:30:26	ubergeek	I regret nothing.
2018-12-19 19:30:27	mushmouth	but you won't 'too busy with irl'
2018-12-19 19:30:42	~ben	i've got a meeting but i'll be reading this later. personal attacks and derogatory slurs are always uncalled for mushmouth 
2018-12-19 19:30:45	mushmouth	i regret nothing either
2018-12-19 19:30:45	+jan6	both of you, wait 5 min before posting your next sentence, ok?

2018-12-19 19:31:19	+jan6	ironic how he "Quit: i'll probably be back soon"
2018-12-19 19:31:31	+jan6	though sad to see him leave
2018-12-19 19:31:35	+aewens	I think that's a default in his client maybe?
2018-12-19 19:31:37	ubergeek	bbiab, if that's ok with everyone here?

2018-12-19 19:32:05	+jan6	ok
2018-12-19 19:32:27	+aewens	So what's everyone doing for the holidays this weekend?
2018-12-19 19:32:37	+jan6	being sick ;P
2018-12-19 19:33:21	+jan6	i think it's the first time in what...2 years? 1 year? more? less? idk, a big amount of time I'm kinda sick...
2018-12-19 19:33:23	+aewens	Well that sucks. What'd you get sick with?
2018-12-19 19:33:27	+jan6	sleeping
2018-12-19 19:33:33	+aewens	wat
2018-12-19 19:34:04	+jan6	I mean, I just woke up with a runny nose, idk-how-to-describe throat, and soggy brain
2018-12-19 19:34:21	+jan6	not sure if soggy is the best description, lol
2018-12-19 19:34:33	+aewens	So a common cold?
2018-12-19 19:36:24	~ahriman	i woke up with a sore throat today
2018-12-19 19:36:37	~ahriman	flying to atlanta to visit my parents on sunday
2018-12-19 19:37:05	+jan6	I sure hope it's nothing bad, like the start of "ear inflammation" (feels like having an invisible earphone/bud/whatever stuck a little too deep)
2018-12-19 19:37:19	+jan6	also i sure hope I'll survive the last few days of school
2018-12-19 19:37:34	~ahriman	jan6: university?
2018-12-19 19:37:48	+jan6	I'm NEVER skipping school whenever possible, and nah, not university
2018-12-19 19:38:07	+jan6	vocational school
2018-12-19 19:38:17	~ahriman	oh ok cool
2018-12-19 19:39:08	~ahriman	jan6: sounds like you have a sinus infection
2018-12-19 19:39:27	+jan6	"IT junior specialist" is the official title I think, not exactly specialist tho, I already knew most of the stuff, or knew how to do them anyway if I hadn't come accross earlier, lol
2018-12-19 19:39:33	+jan6	k
2018-12-19 19:39:51	~ahriman	i think i may be getting a sinus infection too
2018-12-19 19:42:28	+jan6	eeh, yeah
2018-12-19 19:43:07	+jan6	it seems to not be a good thing at all, but also not be terribly bad either...
2018-12-19 19:45:11	~ahriman	it's not as bad as the flu *shrug*
2018-12-19 19:46:15	 *	jan6 makes some tea and sleeps, just took a little seawater spray to the nose too just cause why not
2018-12-19 19:49:46	+aewens	jan6: If you feel like there's something in your ears that's usually from swollen lymph nodes pressing against your ears (which is fairly common if your nose is stuffy)
2018-12-19 19:50:52	+jan6	good to know
2018-12-19 19:51:10	+jan6	quite lucky timing with this too, though not the best
2018-12-19 19:51:37	+jan6	vacation starts this weekend, so hope I'll survive that long without surrendering
2018-12-19 19:52:03	+aewens	If it is just a cold, usually rest + lots of water is all you'll need. You should be fine by the 25th.
2018-12-19 19:53:08	+aewens	I usually opt for drinking 24oz of water followed by NyQuil and let the medically induced coma take the troubles away
2018-12-19 19:54:14	+jan6	öidk what those oozes are you're speekin ov ;P
2018-12-19 19:56:34	+jan6	Achillea millefolium tea + honey should be nice
2018-12-19 19:56:51	+jan6	aka yarrow, aka "irongrass" over here
2018-12-19 19:59:25	+aewens	oz = ounces
2018-12-19 19:59:44	+aewens	I guess here it's technically fl oz (fluid ounces).
2018-12-19 19:59:49	+aewens	Which is ~3 cups
2018-12-19 20:00:11	+jan6	cups is a stupid unit
2018-12-19 20:00:23	+jan6	because I haven't seen any cup that's 1 cup big
2018-12-19 20:00:35	+aewens	What about the measuring cup?
2018-12-19 20:00:39	+jan6	and if a cup isn't a cup, then f*in don't call it a cup
2018-12-19 20:01:04	+jan6	it's not called  "2 measuring cups" y'know
2018-12-19 20:01:15	+aewens	Maybe cups are bigger than 1 cup so it can hold 1 cup with some wiggle room so you can carry it without spilling it?
2018-12-19 20:01:25	~ahriman	jan6: use 24oz of water is 3km
2018-12-19 20:01:32	+jan6	...
2018-12-19 20:01:41	+aewens	Wait, kilometers?
2018-12-19 20:01:44	+jan6	^
2018-12-19 20:01:46	~ahriman	no, really though, it's about 700mLs
2018-12-19 20:01:57	+aewens	That sounds better
2018-12-19 20:02:11	+jan6	lol, how'd you get 3 km anyway?
2018-12-19 20:02:17	~ahriman	it was a joke
2018-12-19 20:02:27	+aewens	As for the tea thing, I usually go with herbal tea with honey and ginger when I'm ill.
2018-12-19 20:02:35	+jan6	how many miles is a milliliter tho? ;P
2018-12-19 20:02:47	~ahriman	.004mi in one mL
2018-12-19 20:02:52	+jan6	it is real dried plant, so herbal it is
2018-12-19 20:03:20	+jan6	no ginger at hand right now tho
2018-12-19 20:03:21	TildeBot	no u infinity jan6
2018-12-19 20:05:15	+aewens	You should reflect on your life, why do you not have ginger poweder in your spice cabinet?
2018-12-19 20:05:34	~ahriman	why do you not have whole ginger root on your counter-top
2018-12-19 20:05:56	+aewens	Because I have a bottle of it in my spice cabinet already?
2018-12-19 20:06:05	~ahriman	and a machete nearby to shave and slice it
2018-12-19 20:06:23	+aewens	I do have a fancy slicer I could use to slice it if I had a ginger root on-hand.
2018-12-19 20:06:34	~ahriman	ooooh i like fancy kitchen utilities
2018-12-19 20:06:46	+aewens	I believe it's a Titan slicer
2018-12-19 20:07:12	~ahriman	i should get some ginger powder to add to soup and stuff
2018-12-19 20:07:24	+jan6	15:05:15        +aewens | You should reflect on your life, why do you not have ginger poweder in your spice cabinet?
2018-12-19 20:07:36	+jan6	because it's a boarding school's hostel
2018-12-19 20:07:43	+jan6	and I tend to never get sick

2018-12-19 20:08:12	+jan6	at least I DO have some honey and tea-herbs, cause parents insisted ;P

2018-12-19 20:09:41	~ahriman	i was hoping youd say yes, you have an industrial meat slicer in your kitchen
2018-12-19 20:09:49	+aewens	jan6: You can also use ginger for seasoning chinese food, not just for when you're sick.
2018-12-19 20:09:54	+jan6	eeh
2018-12-19 20:10:19	+jan6	seasoning is for p***ies ;P
2018-12-19 20:10:34	~ahriman	you must eat some bland food then
2018-12-19 20:10:35	+aewens	ahriman: I might soon™, I'm planning to upgrade my kitchenware this year
2018-12-19 20:10:38	+jan6	not really, but eh
2018-12-19 20:10:44	+aewens	jan6: You take that back!
2018-12-19 20:10:48	+jan6	heh
2018-12-19 20:10:57	+aewens	Seasoning food is the spice of life
2018-12-19 20:11:03	+jan6	literally
2018-12-19 20:14:05	+aewens	I season all my food to the fullest extent it can be without overpowering it.
2018-12-19 20:15:12	+aewens	Which if you haven't taken up the craft of cooking, I'd advise looking into it. It's life changing.
2018-12-19 20:15:40	+jan6	nay

2018-12-19 20:17:38	+jan6	0
2018-12-19 20:18:13	+jan6	well, tbh, lately it's more instant oatmeal and/or muesli
2018-12-19 20:18:31	+jan6	last year it was instant noodles, but eh, got tired of those
2018-12-19 20:19:04	+aewens	That sounds awful
2018-12-19 20:19:53	+jan6	why so? I get free PROPER lunch at school of course
2018-12-19 20:21:06	+aewens	Because instant oatmeal and noodles are so devoid of the flavors you can taste in the world.
2018-12-19 20:21:21	+jan6	the oatmeal's with blueberries!
2018-12-19 20:21:47	+aewens	That being said, making instant noodles more palatable was how I got into cooking initially.
2018-12-19 20:21:49	+jan6	plus sometimes I add some homemade jam
2018-12-19 20:22:38	+aewens	Like, if you cook the noodles in a pot on the stove, you can toss in an egg and some soy sauce and now you've got egg drop ramen.
2018-12-19 20:23:17	+aewens	Add in some garlic, ginger, and sriracha and now you have something to get excited about.

2018-12-19 20:24:05	+jan6	nope
2018-12-19 20:24:13	+jan6	ever used a microwave, ever
2018-12-19 20:24:29	+aewens	How do you cook your instant foods then?
2018-12-19 20:24:35	+jan6	there's a reason i use the instant kind ;P

2018-12-19 20:25:16	+jan6	which are?
2018-12-19 20:25:23	+jan6	season with everything?
2018-12-19 20:25:26	+aewens	Add in some spices.
2018-12-19 20:25:32	+jan6	nay
2018-12-19 20:25:45	+aewens	You can also throw in some lunch meat to give it some variety.
2018-12-19 20:25:53	+jan6	I do have some rice in bags tho, and THAT requires some spices
2018-12-19 20:26:00	+jan6	lunch meat?
2018-12-19 20:26:10	+aewens	Rice is literally the only thing I eat that I don't season.
2018-12-19 20:26:32	+aewens	But yeah, if you rip up some roast beef and throw it in the instant noodles it's pretty good.
2018-12-19 20:26:33	+jan6	lol, now RICE is too bland without any seasoning
2018-12-19 20:26:46	+jan6	I'd need to get my hands on some roast beef tho
2018-12-19 20:27:03	+aewens	If I eat it alone I might throw some soy sauce on it, but it's usually a side I eat with other food.
2018-12-19 20:27:24	+jan6	I have a tube of minced meat I bought like 2 weeks ago...too lazy to cook it, lol
2018-12-19 20:27:29	+aewens	jan6: Ideally, it'd be chunks of actual meat but I'm assuming college kid budget (which is what I had then too).
2018-12-19 20:27:50	+jan6	technically I have money, practically I'd rather not waste it
2018-12-19 20:28:33	+aewens	Well sure, now is the time to save as it is.
2018-12-19 20:30:45	+jan6	I've seen Boris's video of living on buget too tho ;P

2018-12-19 20:41:48	+jan6	more like :30

2018-12-19 20:45:47	+aewens	It looks like he cut smaller ones to go on the sandwich after the cut in the video though.
2018-12-19 20:48:16	+aewens	But yeah, the aewens approved way of consuming sausage: get some crackers, get some cheese, get some brown mustard, cut up the sausage into thin slices, place the cheese on the cracker and mustard on the cheese and sausage on the mustard.
2018-12-19 20:48:22	+aewens	Boom, a snack for kings
2018-12-19 20:49:17	+aewens	And don't skip out on the brown mustard, it's a crucial component to bring it all together.

2018-12-19 20:52:48	+aewens	It's a gradient going from literal mustard seeds and grey poupon down to the well known yellow mustard.
2018-12-19 20:53:09	+aewens	Brown mustard is the next rung up above yellow mustard.
2018-12-19 20:53:36	+aewens	ahriman: It really is glorious, always keep it around when a need for snacking arises.

2018-12-19 21:07:52	robdrake	so if I'm judging too harshly I'll apologize to all in the channel

To be fair towards mushmouth, schizophrenia isn't just "i see hallucinations" but also has factors like paranoia and distorted experiences of social interactions. If the guy felt he was being targeted and repeatedly shown aggression or harassment from a group of people I wouldn't say his behavior was 100% inexcusable.
2018-12-19 21:31:28	jeschust	yeah one reason why i keep using my uni login (just my initials and 6 letters of last) is the j.c. confusion lol

2018-12-19 22:16:27	Severak	wow. Tilderadio actually in air? :D

2018-12-19 22:16:46	robdrake	low power radio ubergeek?
2018-12-19 22:16:57	%ubergeek	yeah, sub 100mW/100m
2018-12-19 22:17:13	%ubergeek	*should* cover my block.  Maybe.

2018-12-19 22:17:32	~khuxkm|lounge	apply to FCC for a LP station
2018-12-19 22:17:34	%ubergeek	Maybe the neighborhood.

2018-12-19 22:17:42	~khuxkm|lounge	oof
2018-12-19 22:17:57	~khuxkm|lounge	I mean, the local civics center did, and they got through
2018-12-19 22:18:29	%ubergeek	I looked into it...  It's nuts, the license period isn't opened (Will be soon, per the FCC since 2009), and no channels open since all the local christian retrans stations won them
2018-12-19 22:18:57	%ubergeek	So, now we have no empty channels where LPFM can be, but we do have 9 stations all transmitting the exact same thing
2018-12-19 22:19:47	robdrake	fuck
2018-12-19 22:20:02	~khuxkm|lounge	ubergeek: where exactly in Buffalo do you live?
2018-12-19 22:20:12	~khuxkm|lounge	also what network is it?
2018-12-19 22:20:18	robdrake	too bad you can't retransmit tilderadio via pirate radio
2018-12-19 22:20:19	%ubergeek	near West Seneca
2018-12-19 22:20:26	~khuxkm|lounge	ah
2018-12-19 22:20:35	%ubergeek	I *would*, but it'd put my ham license at risk :(
2018-12-19 22:20:39	%ubergeek	bbiab
2018-12-19 22:20:58	robdrake	this is not worth your ham license
2018-12-19 22:20:59	~khuxkm|lounge	ubergeek: near West Seneca East and the high school?
2018-12-19 22:23:07	~khuxkm|lounge	if so, and you can operate with enough power on an open band I may be able to bring my transistor radio to the band show at the high school
2018-12-19 22:23:15	~khuxkm|lounge	and I may be able to receive it
2018-12-19 22:48:58	%ubergeek	Um...  Near Winchester Middle.  Right near Ogden and Clinto (kaisertown)

2018-12-19 22:57:03	~khuxkm|lounge	hi foss
2018-12-19 22:57:08	fosslinux	hi khuxkm|lounge 
2018-12-19 22:57:11	fosslinux	whats up
2018-12-19 22:57:21	~khuxkm|lounge	we're currently discussing how 9 LPFM slots went to Christian stations all playing the same thing
2018-12-19 22:57:40	~khuxkm|lounge	so there isn't any open for uber to use as a tilderadio over-the-air
2018-12-19 22:57:55	fosslinux	LPFM?
2018-12-19 22:58:11	~khuxkm|lounge	low-power FM
2018-12-19 22:58:22	fosslinux	right
2018-12-19 22:58:23	~khuxkm|lounge	for educational/non-commercial stations
2018-12-19 22:58:35	fosslinux	so why did 9 go to stations all playing the exact same thing
2018-12-19 22:58:43	fosslinux	thats the dummest thing i've ever heard
2018-12-19 22:59:43	%ubergeek	They had the lobbying group to do it, and the money for lawyers
2018-12-19 23:00:08	fosslinux	wow
2018-12-19 23:01:07	%ubergeek	But the restrictions on channel spacing is silly, too.  High power stations only require 1, sometimes two channels of separation.  LPFM require 3.
2018-12-19 23:01:21	%ubergeek	WHich means there were very few possible channels in each amrket
2018-12-19 23:01:27	%ubergeek	*market
2018-12-19 23:01:57	fosslinux	hmm yeah
2018-12-19 23:02:05	fosslinux	so was your idea to have tilderadio on a lpfm
2018-12-19 23:02:44	%ubergeek	no, part 15
2018-12-19 23:02:53	%ubergeek	low-low-power FM
2018-12-19 23:03:09	%ubergeek	Basically, you can buy a transmitter for it at Walmart, in the auto section
2018-12-19 23:03:43	 *	Severak OFF
2018-12-19 23:04:15	fosslinux	lol thats so easy to transmit
2018-12-19 23:04:28	fosslinux	what kind of freqyency is that
2018-12-19 23:04:31	%ubergeek	yeah.  altitude is king for FM radio
2018-12-19 23:04:57	~khuxkm|lounge	my idea was use an LPFM anyways
2018-12-19 23:04:58	%ubergeek	88.7MHz - 108.1 MHz
2018-12-19 23:05:03	~khuxkm|lounge	s/anyways//
2018-12-19 23:05:04	sedbot	<khuxkm|lounge> my idea was use an LPFM 
2018-12-19 23:05:28	fosslinux	where can you get one
2018-12-19 23:05:38	%ubergeek	I could use the broadcast band FM exciter I have already.. 15W out :P
2018-12-19 23:06:31	%ubergeek	trying it legal-beagle, though, so as to not bring shame and dishonor to the tildeverse :)

2018-12-19 23:25:37	~ben	https://tilde.chat/wiki/?page=servers
2018-12-19 23:25:56	+aewens	And only 84 people have solved problem 636, which looks to be the least solved problem on the listing.

2018-12-19 23:27:11	+aewens	I'm trying to decide between trying to solve it, or the 2nd least solved problem 579 that happens to have a higher difficulty scoring than 636.
2018-12-19 23:27:39	+aewens	I think I'll start with 636 and if I somehow solve it I'll go with 579 next?
2018-12-19 23:28:05	~ben	nice; do it
2018-12-19 23:29:58	+aewens	As you'd expect, a number machine cannot brute-force the problem from the rudementary perspective, but I think I have an insight that might solve it.

2018-12-19 23:33:00	fosslinux	thats a big wat
2018-12-19 23:33:52	+aewens	For those who don't haven't seen the problem, it's finding all possible factorizations for 1000000! using one integer and any series of squares, cubes, or quartic of integers.
2018-12-19 23:34:10	~ben	oh wow
2018-12-19 23:34:38	+aewens	Well, the number of factorizations passed through modulus 1,000,000,007 to make it smaller.
2018-12-19 23:34:55	%ubergeek	^^^ he did the math
2018-12-19 23:35:07	+aewens	You are given F(25!)=4933, so I have to get it working with that first.
2018-12-19 23:35:44	fosslinux	oh crappp thats hard
2018-12-19 23:35:55	@ben|bsd	o ye
2018-12-19 23:36:18	+aewens	Then I can take on the *real* challenge of F(1000000!) % 1000000007, which involves never actually doing 1000000! because that breaks all 64-bit machines.
2018-12-19 23:36:56	fosslinux	ayyyyy
2018-12-19 23:36:59	fosslinux	i did autosort

2018-12-19 23:38:10	+aewens	Anyways, I'm going to think about how to solve that problem during the ride home. Time to face traffic and all of that.
