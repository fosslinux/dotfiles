2018-11-14 15:18:10	ben	oh no problems
2018-11-15 07:34:38	fosslinux	you said that "you've added firewall rules to prevent traffic to hetzner"
2018-11-15 07:34:48	fosslinux	what's that meant to do?
2018-11-15 07:35:53	ben	rfc1918 says that 10.0.0.0/8, 172.1.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 are private and non routable
2018-11-15 07:35:57	ben	so i set to them to deny 
2018-11-15 07:36:08	fosslinux	oh
2018-11-15 07:36:15	fosslinux	so now i can't ping local addresses?
2018-11-15 07:36:17	fosslinux	good
2018-11-15 07:36:27	ben	hetzner's network setup is weird that the those all route to the default gateway
2018-11-15 07:36:36	fosslinux	wtf
2018-11-15 07:36:53	ben	yeah idk
2018-11-15 07:36:58	ben	but it should be fine now
2018-11-15 07:37:02	fosslinux	good
2018-11-15 07:37:07	fosslinux	thanks for fixing it :D
2018-11-15 07:37:16	ben	heh, hopefully it works
