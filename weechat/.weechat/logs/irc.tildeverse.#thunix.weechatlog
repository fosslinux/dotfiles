2018-11-18 19:02:38	ben	wha happened
2018-11-18 19:10:10	amcclure	According to Naglfar, hexhaxtron just shut down the server
2018-11-18 19:11:03	ben	on purpose or accident?
2018-11-18 19:12:13	amcclure	we don't really have any information about why
2018-11-18 19:14:12	ben	huh
2018-11-18 19:14:16	ben	that's shitty
2018-11-18 19:14:40	amcclure	I asked if Naglfar and Bercik, two other sysadmins for thunix if they could join this channel
2018-11-18 19:18:06	ben	oh ok
2018-11-18 19:18:32	amcclure	haven't gotten a response yet
2018-11-18 19:22:34	ben	isn't his email @thunix.org?
2018-11-18 19:23:13	amcclure	thunix (server) is down completely, every @thunix.org email address is inaccessable
2018-11-18 19:23:29	ben	oh, you weren't emailing
2018-11-18 19:23:37	amcclure	I was using irc

2018-11-18 19:29:49	amcclure	hi
2018-11-18 19:30:03	Naglfar	what happening ?
2018-11-18 19:30:36	ben	heh i was hoping you might know
2018-11-18 19:32:51	Naglfar	the latest news I have is that hexhaxtron shutdown thunix
2018-11-18 19:34:25	amcclure	I was hoping we could at least be able to figure out what to do from here since thunix is gone
2018-11-18 19:35:21	amcclure	for example: every users that wasn't and isn't still aware about the shutdown
2018-11-18 19:37:00	Naglfar	we can't email them
2018-11-18 19:38:01	amcclure	I don't have a list of registered users let alone any way to contact most of them unless they're still on irc
2018-11-18 19:38:56	fosslinux	amcclure: jesus
2018-11-18 19:38:58	Naglfar	anyway, we can't provide them backup files or another login shell
2018-11-18 19:39:06	fosslinux	oh dear thats BAD
2018-11-18 19:39:29	amcclure	very bad
2018-11-18 19:40:03	fosslinux	can you contact hexhaxatron
2018-11-18 19:41:00	amcclure	idk
2018-11-18 19:41:14	amcclure	the only contact information I have for him is hexhaxtron@thunix.org
2018-11-18 19:41:32	fosslinux	ur admin right
2018-11-18 19:41:50	amcclure	the server's down completely
2018-11-18 19:41:55	fosslinux	lucky i didn't have anything on there
2018-11-18 19:42:03	amcclure	lucky
2018-11-18 19:42:11	fosslinux	but amcclure, are/were you admin on thuix
2018-11-18 19:42:39	fosslinux	thunix.org is down too
2018-11-18 19:42:40	amcclure	Naglfar and I were 2 of the admins
2018-11-18 19:42:57	fosslinux	right
2018-11-18 19:43:00	amcclure	everything *.thunix.org is down
2018-11-18 19:43:14	fosslinux	any other way than irc to contact everyone?
2018-11-18 19:43:24	amcclure	none that I know of
2018-11-18 19:43:39	fosslinux	jesus
2018-11-18 19:43:43	fosslinux	thats screwed up
2018-11-18 19:46:41	fosslinux	is there anywhere that there was a list of accounts?
2018-11-18 19:47:36	amcclure	not that I know of
2018-11-18 19:48:02	fosslinux	this is more screwed than the ip lock
2018-11-18 19:48:35	fosslinux	ben: you should learn from this, does ~team have off-site (ie not-from-hetzner) backups?
2018-11-18 19:48:45	fosslinux	thats a bit unrealistic for thunix
2018-11-18 19:48:52	fosslinux	tbh 6tb
2018-11-18 19:48:56	amcclure	I made occasional backups of my site
2018-11-18 19:49:07	amcclure	not mirrors since those are just mirrors
2018-11-18 19:49:49	fosslinux	my site and everything on ~team is a) in a git repository syncing to my home pc b) in my lxd container using syncthing to sync to my home pc and a raspberry pi
2018-11-18 19:50:25	amcclure	non-site content wasn't backed up either
2018-11-18 19:50:49	Naglfar	we nave off-site nothing, hexhaxtron left us without suitcases on the street
2018-11-18 19:50:51	fosslinux	amcclure are you asm as well on ~team?
2018-11-18 19:51:00	amcclure	yes
2018-11-18 19:51:14	fosslinux	a
2018-11-18 19:51:15	fosslinux	ah
2018-11-18 19:51:16	fosslinux	ok
2018-11-18 19:52:06	amcclure	I mainly had it since I had an A Name record for amcclure.ttm.sh for thunix's ip address
2018-11-18 19:52:22	fosslinux	right
2018-11-18 19:53:52	ben	i have offsite backups hourly with tarsnap
2018-11-18 19:54:22	fosslinux	good boy
2018-11-18 19:54:28	 *	fosslinux pats ben on head
2018-11-18 19:54:40	amcclure	I remember hexhaxtron kept backups too
2018-11-18 19:54:49	fosslinux	offsite?
2018-11-18 19:55:00	ben	do we know if it was accidental or on purpose?
2018-11-18 19:55:06	ben	was there any communication from him?
2018-11-18 19:55:07	fosslinux	^
2018-11-18 19:55:24	Naglfar	on purpose, < hexhaxtron__> I need to shutdown thunix...
2018-11-18 19:55:41	ben	oh damn that sucks
2018-11-18 19:55:52	fosslinux	when was that?
2018-11-18 19:55:55	fosslinux	was that on irc?
2018-11-18 19:56:08	ben	shutdown doesn't necessarily mean forever either
2018-11-18 19:56:28	Naglfar	this was the last communcation with him: < hexhaxtron__> I'm starting to hate it...
2018-11-18 19:56:31	fosslinux	ik
2018-11-18 19:56:38	Naglfar	on irc
2018-11-18 19:56:39	fosslinux	I'm starting to hate it...
2018-11-18 19:56:42	fosslinux	dm?
2018-11-18 19:56:46	fosslinux	or was it on #thunix?
2018-11-18 19:56:48	fosslinux	i cant find it
2018-11-18 19:56:49	ben	huh
2018-11-18 19:56:51	ben	:(
2018-11-18 19:56:53	fosslinux	oh no
2018-11-18 19:56:57	fosslinux	thats really really bad
2018-11-18 19:57:03	ben	btw amcclure i removed your amcclure.ttm.sh A record
2018-11-18 19:57:12	amcclure	ty
2018-11-18 19:57:21	fosslinux	you'd think that at least he'd give you a snapshot of the disk so you can "revive" it
2018-11-18 19:57:57	amcclure	I remember him once mentioning that running the server caused issues with services and stuff
2018-11-18 19:58:05	ben	huh
2018-11-18 19:58:25	fosslinux	"running the server caused issues with services and stuff" what does that mean
2018-11-18 19:58:32	ben	internet service?
2018-11-18 19:58:35	amcclure	from what I know, and idk if it's correct, he ran the server himself
2018-11-18 19:59:06	fosslinux	well the website shows a pic of a server that he seems to be running out of home
2018-11-18 19:59:14	fosslinux	most isps get pissed off about that
2018-11-18 19:59:17	amcclure	Naglfar: do you know if the server was ran from his home?
2018-11-18 19:59:26	fosslinux	http://web.archive.org/web/20181115222403/https://www.thunix.org/?lang=en
2018-11-18 19:59:36	Naglfar	yes, amcclure it was
2018-11-18 19:59:39	amcclure	idk if the ISP cared or not
2018-11-18 20:00:28	fosslinux	ive gtg
2018-11-18 20:00:32	fosslinux	ill check in later
2018-11-18 20:00:33	fosslinux	cya
2018-11-18 20:01:01	amcclure	but with how users were using thunix, especially with how he also had a proxy service, the servers ip got blocked on stuff based on some users activity
