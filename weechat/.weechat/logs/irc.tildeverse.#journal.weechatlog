2018-11-27 12:13:10	khuxkm|lounge	we need to promote ourselves better
2018-11-27 12:13:25	khuxkm|lounge	and get some submissions
2018-11-27 12:13:36	khuxkm|lounge	amd make a submission list page
2018-11-27 12:14:00	@cmccabe	correct me if i'm wrong, but there have been no articles yet, right?
2018-11-27 12:16:34	@cmccabe	if not, i have an idea for a first one, sort of an overview of the journal concept, and a description of how tildes create a socio-technical space separate from the corporate venues that focuses on human connections and interactions.
2018-11-27 12:17:02	@cmccabe	the other thing, is that i keep thinking this might benefit from some type of connection or bimodal publication format that involves gopher. 
2018-11-27 12:17:17	@cmccabe	(ignore the errant comma...)

2018-11-28 21:48:24	@cmccabe	even though it is really only a hypothetical journal at this point...
2018-11-28 21:48:43	@cmccabe	would anyone have interested in making it a gopher-based journal?
2018-11-28 21:49:03	@cmccabe	fosslinux, do you use gopher?
2018-11-28 21:49:40	ben	what about an instance of https://github.com/writeas/writefreely
2018-11-28 21:50:05	ben	wouldn't really have "issues" like a traditional journal
2018-11-29 05:54:02	fosslinux	cmccabe: i'm trying to get into gopher, learing at the moment
2018-11-29 11:58:03	@cmccabe	ben: i'll support whatever the majority wants to do.  my preference would be to keep it command line oriented though, which is one reason i like gopher.
2018-11-29 11:58:43	@cmccabe	fosslinux: i'm a relative newbie with gopher too. but let me know if you have any questions about it and i can try to help.
2018-11-29 12:45:10	khuxkm|lounge	I prefer the web-based journal, though a gopher based front is OK by me
2018-11-29 12:45:45	khuxkm|lounge	https://journal.tildeverse.org/charter.php
2018-11-29 12:45:57	khuxkm|lounge	see the charter for an idea
2018-11-29 12:46:14	khuxkm|lounge	it was always meant as more of a repository for information
2018-11-29 15:33:28	@cmccabe	i wrote that charter :)
2018-11-29 15:34:16	@cmccabe	i'm happy to see it go forward in whatever way gets the most people involved.
2018-11-29 19:35:58	fosslinux	we can always do both
